Hey.

41
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,709
What are you doing here?

42
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:08,876
Well, I got an office here.

43
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,667
You come down with Finn?

44
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,667
And some people.

45
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:16,625
Promise me no, uh,
drinkin' and drivin'.

46
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:18,750
Who's your designated driver?

47
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:21,500
I'm not the one with
all the dents in their car.

48
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:23,625
All right, have fun, huh?

49
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,168
Need some money?

50
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,084
Have a good time, sweetheart.

51
00:02:28,168 --> 00:02:29,959
Be careful!

52
00:02:39,084 --> 00:02:40,250
- You see Meadow?
- Yeah.

53
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,667
I wish I knew she was here.

54
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,584
I wonder what the fuck
she's thinkin'.

55
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:44,667
I'm sorry, Ton.

56
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,417
Some kid had a seizure upstairs.

57
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,750
It's been a horrible night.

58
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,500
Hey, Ton, Vito and Gene
just called.

59
00:02:49,584 --> 00:02:51,650
They're five minutes away.

60
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:54,834
We're leaving. Here.

61
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:56,876
All right, uh, call 'em
and tell 'em to meet us

62
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,542
at Bud's Butter Bun
on Broadway and 18th.

63
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,750
All right.

64
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:11,084
Did I just see your father?

65
00:03:11,168 --> 00:03:13,250
He's got an office here.

66
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,584
Saturday night?

67
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:17,876
That's dedication.

68
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:19,709
The guy sure can
put in the hours.

69
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,792
Let's go someplace else.

70
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:26,750
Tony's spendin'
so much time at the club.

71
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,542
You think that might have
something to do with you?

72
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,125
Oh, if you think
I'm gonna blow this guy

73
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:35,917
for your sick purposes,
you are sadly mistaken.

74
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,084
So go on about this
phone call the other night.

75
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,750
It was just some guy
with a Southern accent.

76
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:45,042
Christopher grabbed the phone

77
00:03:45,126 --> 00:03:46,876
and yelled at him
for callin' the house.

78
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,375
Said he'd see him down there.

79
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:49,542
Down where?

80
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,084
Did you check
the log on his cell?

81
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,791
Not since I almost
got caught doin' that,

82
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:54,876
and I am not doin' it again.

83
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,500
Wait'll he goes into the shower.

84
00:03:57,584 --> 00:04:00,168
See if there's a 4-0-4 or 3-3-6,

85
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,834
and memorize any other
numbers you don't recognize.

86
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:04,709
Oof...

87
00:04:04,792 --> 00:04:06,001
What's the matter?

88
00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:07,667
I gotta go to the bathroom.

89
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,500
- I know, you said.
- No, I, g--

90
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:10,834
I-I gotta go.

91
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:13,792
Number two.

92
00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:15,250
I'll take you to your car.

93
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,792
No, I gotta go now.

94
00:04:16,876 --> 00:04:18,375
Oh, my God.

95
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:23,959
You okay?

96
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:25,792
We're almost there.

97
00:04:25,876 --> 00:04:27,834
Try to relax.

98
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:30,084
Don't you got a general
anesthetic or somethin'?

99
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:31,750
This lidocaine didn't do much.

100
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:35,333
And we are... done.

101
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:38,126
Jan, wanna do your thing?

102
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:44,168
Just keep a little pressure.

103
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,625
All right.

104
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:47,041
I'm gonna get this
down to the lab.

105
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:48,168
See what's what.

106
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,084
Okay.

107
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:53,709
There we go.

108
00:04:55,126 --> 00:04:56,042
You okay?

109
00:04:56,126 --> 00:04:57,709
You think he got it all?

110
00:04:57,792 --> 00:04:59,084
We hope so.

111
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:00,792
Meantime, there's
a canteen on level L.

112
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:02,959
I'll let you know
when the results come back.

113
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:10,459
Does having a bowel movement
relieve the pain?

114
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:12,084
Yeah.

115
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:13,709
Would you describe the diarrhea

116
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:15,750
as loose or liquid?

117
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:17,084
Liquid.

118
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:18,448
But this is gettin'
so I'm afraid

119
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:19,667
to be away from the toilet.

120
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,250
I'm so scared I'm
gonna have an accident.

121
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,709
Is this tender?

122
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:25,250
No.

123
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:27,750
Sit up.

124
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,459
How's your personal life?

125
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:37,750
What do you mean?

126
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:39,834
Well, sometimes GI disturbances

127
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:41,417
are stress-related.

128
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,001
Is there anything unusual

129
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:45,333
that might be giving
you the jim-jams?

130
00:05:48,126 --> 00:05:49,499
I just want somethin'
for my stomach

131
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
so I can quit
goin' to the bathroom.

132
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,709
That's what's givin' me stress.

133
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:55,168
Why don't you get dressed?

134
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,959
We'll talk in my office.

135
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:04,459
I hear you're spending time
with today's youth.

136
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:06,500
You lost me.

137
00:06:06,584 --> 00:06:09,625
Meadow said she saw you
at Adriana's club.

138
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:11,584
I gotta explain
my business to you now?

139
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:12,667
After so many years?

140
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:14,750
No, it's your life, Tony.

141
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:16,126
Got that right.

142
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:18,077
What'd you do to your head?

143
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:19,542
Did you fall again?

144
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:20,666
Banged it on the medicine chest.

145
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:21,667
Don't worry about it.

146
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:22,876
It's nothin'.

147
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:25,792
There's your allowance.

148
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:33,168
Now, that actually
looks like fruit.

149
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,250
Yeah, it's so hard.

150
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:39,333
What do you do it for?

151
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:53,917
Irritable bowel syndrome?

152
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:56,084
He'll know more
when the tests come back.

153
00:06:56,168 --> 00:06:58,709
I still gotta bring him
a stool sample.

154
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,417
Jesus, please.

155
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,416
You were the one who yelled
at me to go to the doctor.

156
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:04,750
I gotta know every detail?

157
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:06,750
I could be really sick,
Christopher.

158
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:09,584
Yeah, my Aunt Josephine
had colon cancer.

159
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:12,417
Her whole asshole rotted out.

160
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,168
I may have to go into therapy.

161
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,584
Plus, they might
put me on Prozac.

162
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:19,917
For diarrhea?

163
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:22,209
To help me cope
and handle stress,

164
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:24,042
which is a lot
of what causes it.

165
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:25,959
What do you gotta
be stressed about?

166
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:27,709
That bar?

167
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,500
War, Christopher.

168
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,168
The Middle East.

169
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,168
You don't listen
to the president?

170
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,876
We're gonna mop the floor
with the whole fuckin' world.

171
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,666
The whole world's
gonna be under our control,

172
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,459
so what are you worked up about?

173
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:58,126
Oh, give me the Orioles
over the Tigers for two

174
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:00,959
and the Jays over
the Rangers, three Gs.

175
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,417
I'll just get my day planner.

176
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,584
No, I'm done.

177
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:19,333
My stupid car.

178
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,917
5,000 miles,
and the alternator's goin'.

179
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,209
What about you?

180
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:28,876
Mimi said you went
to the doctor.

181
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,417
I've been havin'
trouble with my stomach.

182
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,250
That's why I'm drinkin'
White Russians.

183
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,542
- Wh-what?
You got ulcers already?

184
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,126
It's called IBS.

185
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:39,333
What's that?

186
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:44,834
Irritable bowel syndrome.

187
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:49,250
My mother had that all her life.

188
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:52,542
See this?

189
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,209
Yeah, I noticed that,
what happened?

190
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:56,209
- It's cancer.
- What?

191
00:08:56,292 --> 00:08:58,168
Yeah, squamous.

192
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,667
Oh, my God, that's terrible.

193
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,417
Well, they think
they got it all.

194
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,750
Knock wood. Just... cancer.

195
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,834
The things that run
through your head, you know.

196
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:08,876
Sure.

197
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,001
I got a top guy, though.

198
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,417
Katz.

199
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,625
Hesh recommended him.

200
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:14,709
Naturally.

201
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:22,168
So this... disease you got.

202
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,584
What causes it?

203
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:26,375
I did a Google on it,
and, like, the doctor, too,

204
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,667
they--they all say a lot
of it's psychological.

205
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:32,168
So on top of everything,
now I'm a head case.

206
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,667
No, come on.

207
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,459
Stop blamin' yourself.

208
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:39,168
Christopher don't wanna know.

209
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,084
Not that I blame him.

210
00:09:47,876 --> 00:09:50,250
Ah, I gotta take off.

211
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,084
AJ should be comin' home
from his volleyball thing.

212
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,542
Listen, don't say anything
to anybody, okay?

213
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,750
People hear "cancer,"
they start to bury you already.

214
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,959
And you don't tell anybody
what I told you.

215
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:07,584
All right,
take care of yourself.

216
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,168
Say hi to Anthony.

217
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,542
Yeah.

218
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,709
You're such a good father.

219
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,917
I wish my dad
had been like that.

220
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,333
'Night, dear.

221
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:23,459
It's a straight shot
on I-95 to Raleigh.

222
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:25,126
You give this shit to the fence,

223
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,667
I'll meet you in Winston-Salem,

224
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,834
we'll load up the cigs
and come home.

225
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:30,625
We're pickin' up
so many cigarettes.

226
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:33,417
Why don't we, instead of two
vans, rent a deuce and a half?

227
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,209
You know, share the drivin'.

228
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:36,542
Because the cops.

229
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,042
The van's under the radar.

230
00:10:38,126 --> 00:10:39,959
Erik Estrada over here.

231
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:41,542
Forgot your folic acid.

232
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,209
What is all this stuff?

233
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:46,625
A beauty parlor chair?

234
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:49,126
If they even heard of
electrolysis down there.

235
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:50,292
Where you goin'?

236
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,333
Jesus Christ, go back to bed.

237
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:53,750
What the fuck's your problem?

238
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:56,500
My fuckin' tooth is killin' me.

239
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:59,168
Well, you should
go back to the dentist.

240
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,584
Why do you have to go anyway?

241
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,168
Can't they just
drop this stuff off?

242
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,500
Tony wants me to talk
to the guys down there.

243
00:11:04,584 --> 00:11:07,126
The jerk you were
yellin' at on the phone?

244
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,129
Is it the cigarette thing
you were talkin' about?

245
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,250
Six different kinds of dope

246
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,834
you get to take
for a stomachache.

247
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:14,876
I got a fuckin' impaction,
I can't take shit

248
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,750
besides oil of clove
'cause I'm sober.

249
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:18,584
I know, it's hard. I'm sorry.

250
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:19,834
Have a nice trip.

251
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:21,792
I love you. Call me.

252
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:23,584
She's got diarrhea.

253
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:32,292
Whoops.

254
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,209
You want?

255
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:37,959
Ah, twist my arm.

256
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,209
I'm expectin' some guys
from New York, so...

257
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:46,459
No problem.

258
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:47,702
I got plenty to do out there.

259
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:52,542
Ah...

260
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,209
- Who's this on?
- Oh, please.

261
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:55,625
It's called The Lost Boys.

262
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:56,791
Sil's been raggin'
on me all week

263
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:58,084
for me to play 'em here.

264
00:11:58,168 --> 00:12:00,709
Their manager or somebody
owes him money.

265
00:12:04,084 --> 00:12:06,500
So, uh, I thought
this was your day off.

266
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:08,792
Chrissy's away.

267
00:12:08,876 --> 00:12:11,625
I don't like stayin' home alone.

268
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:13,429
Although at least
I can pour a glass of wine

269
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:16,333
without him givin' me
"the expression."

270
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:19,333
Yeah. Yeah, I know that look.

271
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:21,667
The, uh--the
"constipated owl" look.

272
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,876
You know, when I first met you,

273
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,333
I was scared of you.

274
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:37,750
Really?

275
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:41,084
Yeah, but I'm scared
of everybody.

276
00:12:41,168 --> 00:12:43,084
It's always my first reaction.

277
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:48,250
Well, you're not scared
of me now, are you?

278
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,084
No.

279
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,375
You wanna shoot?

280
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,126
Huh?

281
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:00,625
Make it interesting,
sawbuck a game.

282
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:15,959
Mm?

283
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:19,292
No, it's--it's the round thing,

284
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,459
in the middle there.

285
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,374
How you feelin'? Everything
all right in here now?

286
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,792
- Your stomach all right?
- D-don't--

287
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:27,596
I know what you're doin'.
Don't distract me.

288
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,126
Oh.

289
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:34,542
- Ho!
- Hmm.

290
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:37,459
I've been hustled.

291
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:44,126
Oops. Did I get your toes?

292
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:45,792
No. No, no, no, no, no.

293
00:13:45,876 --> 00:13:47,417
I'm so sorry.

294
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,625
Come on, get up.

295
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:55,834
Come on.

296
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:11,834
Ah, shit.

297
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,126
All right.

298
00:14:16,876 --> 00:14:18,126
Wait.

299
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:22,084
Yeah. Go on.

300
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:26,709
Tony here?

301
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:28,959
Yeah, come on in.

302
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:30,168
Hey.

303
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,750
Let me know if you guys
need anything.

304
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,167
What, are you gonna tell me
about the traffic again?

305
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,250
Here, our friend
sent this for you.

306
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:43,459
Thank you for takin'
the appointment.

307
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:47,126
And--and I know
I'm on probation,

308
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:51,292
and--and I deeply regret...

309
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,333
what I did.

310
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:08,750
My nephew's fiancée.

311
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:14,625
I know what you're thinkin'.

312
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:16,333
So?

313
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:18,667
Well, nothin' happened...

314
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,876
but it could've, very easily.

315
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:24,427
I mean she really got to me,
this young lady.

316
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,168
She, uh...

317
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:28,792
What?

318
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:31,500
This is a very big step.

319
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:33,250
Yeah, tell me about it.

320
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,001
I mean, that you've come here
to talk about this impulse

321
00:16:36,084 --> 00:16:38,417
instead of just acting on it
without thinking.

322
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,375
No, I always think.

323
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:42,542
- Really?
- Yeah.

324
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,917
Having sex with
your mistress's cousin,

325
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:49,417
like the mistress wasn't enough
to piss off your wife.

326
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,168
Tell me about the niece.

327
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,001
She's drop-dead gorgeous.

328
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,042
I mean, someone like her,
I could...

329
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:06,459
I could do it right this time.

330
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:09,084
I could start
a whole new family.

331
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:12,542
I'm young enough.

332
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:15,792
Fuck 'em all.

333
00:17:17,084 --> 00:17:20,001
And this is something
you're contemplating?

334
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:21,459
What?

335
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,126
It'd be a disaster.

336
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,917
Of major proportions.

337
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:27,084
Carmela, I-I-I'd
get hosed financially.

338
00:17:27,168 --> 00:17:29,667
There'd be no reasonin'
with her after that.

339
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,084
And--and my nephew, it--
it would kill him.

340
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:36,042
After years of groomin' him
to be my number two.

341
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,750
And it'd be very bad
for the girl.

342
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:43,209
She doesn't deserve that.

343
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:44,625
I mean, I'm not stupid.

344
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:46,625
I know part of it's
this father-figure thing

345
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:49,750
and, you know,
on account a hers ran off.

346
00:17:51,084 --> 00:17:54,584
It would be like committing
an act of symbolic incest.

347
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:56,500
Whatever.

348
00:17:58,417 --> 00:17:59,542
Look, what am I gonna do?

349
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,625
I-I got lucky the first time

350
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:03,209
'cause I was able
to control myself.

351
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,876
But you only get one of those.

352
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,250
Rationalizing.

353
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,625
"I can't control myself."

354
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:10,417
You can.

355
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,917
I don't know.

356
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:13,250
It's different for women.

357
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,417
It's all about up here
with them.

358
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,333
She could make a play for you.

359
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:19,001
You might wanna think about

360
00:18:19,084 --> 00:18:23,375
how you're going to establish
limits and boundaries.

361
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:26,042
For example, you could tell her

362
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:27,542
she means a great deal to you,

363
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,834
but you think of her
as a daughter.

364
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:32,459
Even if I wanna
fuck her brains out.

365
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:35,542
This is a milestone for you.

366
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,625
You're at a very
important crossroads.

367
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:40,584
For once, you want to avoid

368
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:43,667
doing something
you know is wrong

369
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,168
and would be destructive,
both to yourself

370
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,542
and to the people
you care about.

371
00:18:50,001 --> 00:18:51,417
That's growth.

372
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,917
That's progress.

373
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:55,168
Just tell me
what I'm supposed to do.

374
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,333
You have to be honest
with yourself.

375
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:59,792
I know this is a powerful urge,

376
00:18:59,876 --> 00:19:01,792
but if you can't
keep it in your pants,

377
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:04,126
you have to stay away from her.

378
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,084
You know...

379
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:22,042
Not long ago, you stood
in my outer office.

380
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:26,084
I recall you used the words
"drop-dead gorgeous" about me

381
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:28,750
and how you had to have me.

382
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:33,667
I said I wouldn't date you,
and look, you survived.

383
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,333
What a horrible
fuckin' job you have.

384
00:19:36,417 --> 00:19:37,792
How do you do it?

385
00:19:39,084 --> 00:19:41,709
But what happens now
is your choice.

386
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:44,667
Act, and create a bed of misery,

387
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,876
or you can look at this as
a chance to do something good.

388
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:53,459
You say she respects you.

389
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:56,126
Be worthy of respect.

390
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:59,959
See if you can remain
a--a friend to this woman.

391
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:03,584
A help to her.

392
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,750
You know,
Tony had ducks one time.

393
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:14,375
In his pool.

394
00:20:16,126 --> 00:20:18,500
You need to find out
where Chris went.

395
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,750
I'm gettin' this vibe from him.

396
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:22,959
Who? Tony?

397
00:20:23,042 --> 00:20:24,876
He's really nice,

398
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,625
and he listens.

399
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:28,625
He's kind of attractive.

400
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:31,625
Definitely an alpha male.

401
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:33,750
But what if Christopher
found out?

402
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:35,042
What?

403
00:20:35,126 --> 00:20:36,459
I'm not gonna fuck him.

404
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:38,375
Then what are you talking about?

405
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:41,000
I love Christopher,
and sooner or later,

406
00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:42,541
we're gonna get out
from under all this shit

407
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:44,168
and leave this fuckin' state.

408
00:20:45,584 --> 00:20:47,168
Jesus Christ.

409
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,500
She's a good-looking woman,

410
00:20:48,584 --> 00:20:50,126
and she wants to fuck
Barney Rubble?

411
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:52,250
"We really don't know him.

412
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,001
He listens."

413
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:09,584
Tony, hi.

414
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:11,542
Hey. How you doin'?

415
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,792
Well, why I'm here--
Patsy's bringin' somebody by.

416
00:21:13,876 --> 00:21:15,292
I'm gonna need
to use the office.

417
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:17,542
No problem.

418
00:21:17,584 --> 00:21:18,959
I made a resolution.

419
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:21,542
I gotta start spendin'
a lot more time on the floor.

420
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,500
Crack the whip.

421
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:29,876
I'm beat, tell you the truth.

422
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,375
I think I'm gonna grab,
uh, 40 winks

423
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:32,876
till Patsy gets here.

424
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:37,126
You don't have
Chrissy's cell, do you?

425
00:21:37,209 --> 00:21:39,709
He called, but he didn't
leave a new number.

426
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,209
He'll probably try you again.

427
00:21:44,292 --> 00:21:45,667
He's due back tomorrow.

428
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,667
Oh, excuse me.

429
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,917
- I'll come back.
- No, I'm all right.

430
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:15,375
Mole back there looked
irregular around the margins.

431
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:19,209
Every time I see anything now,
I think I got melanoma.

432
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:20,709
I can imagine.

433
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,625
Hi, it's Adriana
at the Crazy Horse.

434
00:22:27,709 --> 00:22:29,917
Yeah, I need a car, please.

435
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:31,667
Just tell him to wait outside.

436
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,834
- What? Your car, still?
- Yeah.

437
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:38,197
They're replacing
the alternator.

438
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:39,750
You want a belt?

439
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:41,292
What I could really use

440
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,459
is some...

441
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:47,042
I wouldn't say no.

442
00:22:47,126 --> 00:22:48,625
Get me motivated
to clean the house

443
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:50,375
before Christopher gets back.

444
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:52,168
Except I'm all out.

445
00:22:53,876 --> 00:22:56,084
It's 2:00-- uh, cross-eyed Billy

446
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:58,459
probably left the Bing already.

447
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:01,459
I know a guy, Andre.
He's always up.

448
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:03,168
Well, cancel the car.

449
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,709
I'll give you a ride.

450
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:16,168
You know who
thinks you're cute...

451
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,667
is Marlene.

452
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,209
She's gotta be over 30,
isn't she?

453
00:23:21,126 --> 00:23:22,500
She's 31.

454
00:23:22,584 --> 00:23:24,584
You know who you
ought to introduce me to

455
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:26,667
is that friend of yours.

456
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,459
Who?

457
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:30,667
The one you brought over
to the house that time.

458
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,250
Tall, kind of blondish,
brownish hair.

459
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,959
Danielle from Whippany.

460
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:36,542
She's dead.

461
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,042
- What?
- Yeah.

462
00:23:40,126 --> 00:23:43,250
She--she dr--
drowned on a picnic.

463
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,876
Oh.

464
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,679
You know, I thought
I picked up on somethin'

465
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,001
between her and me.

466
00:23:50,084 --> 00:23:51,834
I'm not tryin' to be conceited.

467
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:54,542
Tony!

468
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:29,959
I've reviewed your chart

469
00:24:30,042 --> 00:24:31,333
and ruled out internal injuries,

470
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:33,459
so you're free to go.

471
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:35,502
I'll have the nurse
process your discharge orders.

472
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,126
Whoa, whoa.

473
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,625
This was a very bad accident.

474
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:41,959
I mean, are you sure
you did all the tests?

475
00:24:42,042 --> 00:24:44,250
I can afford it.

476
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,333
I did the appropriate tests.

477
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:48,459
I hold a medical degree
from Johns Hopkins.

478
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:50,500
My grandmother was the first
black woman licensed

479
00:24:50,584 --> 00:24:52,542
to practice medicine
in Delaware.

480
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,917
All right, take it easy.

481
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:57,917
The young lady that I was with,
uh, they said she was okay.

482
00:24:58,001 --> 00:24:59,959
But could I see her?

483
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:10,709
Ade.

484
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,584
Hi.

485
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:16,333
They say you're gonna be fine.

486
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:19,209
They just wanna keep you here
for observation.

487
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:21,459
You know, be on the safe side.

488
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,459
I don't even
remember what happened.

489
00:25:28,209 --> 00:25:30,126
There was a raccoon in the road.

490
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:31,876
I swerved.

491
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:36,750
How's your car?

492
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,126
Escalade?

493
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:40,959
It's totaled.

494
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:43,584
Probably saved our life.

495
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:47,959
Are you okay?

496
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:49,209
Yeah.

497
00:25:49,292 --> 00:25:51,042
They're gonna let me go.

498
00:25:51,126 --> 00:25:53,168
I wanna go too.

499
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:56,417
Chrissy's comin' home today.

500
00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:01,959
We should probably
talk about that.

501
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:07,168
Oh...

502
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,250
Yeah.

503
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:10,834
Right.

504
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:24,876
Dude, how you doin'?

505
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,292
I hit the fuckin' mother lode.

506
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:30,209
20 Gs of product a week.

507
00:26:30,292 --> 00:26:32,459
Little Paulie's behind me
with the other half.

508
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:33,876
Fuck me.

509
00:26:34,584 --> 00:26:36,292
Now, 20% of this load,

510
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:38,335
they can stamp the packs
for the vendin' machines.

511
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:41,126
The rest, the cartons can
go straight to the bodegas,

512
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:43,584
let them worry about the stamps.

513
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,333
I'm beat.

514
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:47,126
I'm gonna hit the fuckin' rack,

515
00:26:47,209 --> 00:26:49,500
have Ade cook me up
a nice carbonara.

516
00:26:52,192 --> 00:26:53,542
What's the matter?

517
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:55,791
Don't know how to tell you,
but Adriana's in the hospital.

518
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:57,333
She was in an accident.

519
00:26:57,417 --> 00:26:58,959
What? When?

520
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:01,084
Last night around 2:00.

521
00:27:01,168 --> 00:27:03,792
Jesus Christ, what happened?
Is she all right?

522
00:27:03,876 --> 00:27:06,168
She got banged up,
but she's gonna be okay.

523
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,542
The drinkin' and drivin'.

524
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,876
I told her! Jeez.

525
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,126
Where is she?

526
00:27:10,209 --> 00:27:11,750
- Mount Mercy in Dover.
- Dover?

527
00:27:11,834 --> 00:27:14,500
Apparently, they swerved
to avoid a deer in the road.

528
00:27:14,584 --> 00:27:16,126
"They"?

529
00:27:16,209 --> 00:27:17,750
Her and Tony.

530
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:20,292
Tony? Soprano?

531
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:21,792
Uh-huh.

532
00:27:21,876 --> 00:27:23,959
I-is he all right?

533
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:25,292
Not a scratch.

534
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:27,333
The fuckin' luck on this guy.

535
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:29,168
Yeah.

536
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,126
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dover.

537
00:27:31,209 --> 00:27:33,333
Right, she's got an aunt
she's close to out there

538
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:34,750
who's been sick.

539
00:27:34,834 --> 00:27:37,584
She's, uh--she's friends
with Tony's aunt.

540
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,625
All right, somebody
take me to get my car.

541
00:27:41,709 --> 00:27:43,250
I better get over there.

542
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:45,168
Fabio, put it up!

543
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:55,126
I thought I'd die in there
without a cigarette.

544
00:27:59,917 --> 00:28:02,001
What, so you're
just not gonna talk?

545
00:28:02,084 --> 00:28:03,584
I almost got killed,
Christopher.

546
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:05,500
I'm just curious.

547
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:08,500
What the fuck were you doin'
in the middle of the night,

548
00:28:08,584 --> 00:28:11,667
in the middle of nowhere,
in a car with my uncle?

549
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,126
He was drivin' me home.

550
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:16,459
- Fuckin' Dover?
- We were talkin'.

551
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:19,542
W-we were goin' to get
somethin' to eat.

552
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:22,292
I get off of work,
I don't wanna go right home.

553
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:23,625
You weren't even there.

554
00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:25,625
No, I was in a fuckin'
Ride-A-Rent,

555
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:27,542
bustin' my ass
with a bunch of rednecks,

556
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:30,750
makin' a livin'
to buy you alcohol and coke

557
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,917
and all the other shit
you shovel into your mouth!

558
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,959
2:00 in the fuckin' mornin'?

559
00:28:39,042 --> 00:28:40,084
Don't fuckin' lie to me!

560
00:28:40,168 --> 00:28:41,292
I can't stand it!

561
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:43,209
Nothin' was goin' on,
Christopher!

562
00:28:43,292 --> 00:28:45,667
I should've made you walk home.

563
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,042
I swear to God.

564
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:48,959
You know how this looks?

565
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:51,168
Don't talk to me!
You shut your mouth!

566
00:29:08,584 --> 00:29:10,209
You wanted to see me?

567
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:11,709
Adriana okay?

568
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,625
She's fine.

569
00:29:13,709 --> 00:29:16,333
People who don't clean up
after their pets...

570
00:29:18,917 --> 00:29:22,042
Pop this in that basket
for me, will you?

571
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,168
It was blind luck,
that accident.

572
00:29:35,001 --> 00:29:36,291
Cop told me he thought
he was comin' up

573
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:38,834
on a fatality
when he saw the car.

574
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:43,709
I'd be thinkin'
the same thing if I were you,

575
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:45,834
but it's not true.

576
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,959
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

577
00:29:48,042 --> 00:29:49,625
Her car was in the shop.

578
00:29:49,709 --> 00:29:51,500
I was drivin' her
home from work.

579
00:29:51,584 --> 00:29:53,001
That's all.

580
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:54,667
We were lookin' to get a burger.

581
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,584
- In Dover.
- What difference does it make?

582
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:59,959
You don't seem to give a shit
she almost died.

583
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:03,750
She could've been paralyzed
or--or--or scarred up.

584
00:30:03,834 --> 00:30:05,250
And you got a puss on?

585
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:06,750
What were you doin' out there

586
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:09,042
alone in a car with my fiancée?

587
00:30:09,126 --> 00:30:12,042
We were talkin' about you,
you selfish prick,

588
00:30:12,126 --> 00:30:14,876
and how you're the best thing
that ever happened to her.

589
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:17,417
Oh you don't think
this fuckin' devastates me?

590
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,332
Well, frankly, you scored
so far over your head

591
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:21,375
when you got her,
what do you expect?

592
00:30:21,459 --> 00:30:23,168
The fuck are you talkin' about?

593
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,333
She's a knockout. A ten.

594
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:27,959
And look at you.

595
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:30,500
You're average, at best.

596
00:30:30,584 --> 00:30:32,417
So you better reconcile
yourself with that,

597
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,042
or you're gonna be fuckin'
paranoid your whole life.

598
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:36,917
Oh, so this
is my fuckin' fault now?

599
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,001
Nothin' happened,
and I'm not gonna say it again.

600
00:30:41,001 --> 00:30:42,916
And you should've married
that girl two years ago.

601
00:30:42,917 --> 00:30:44,209
Everybody knows

602
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:46,459
you've been the biggest
fuckin' cooze hound around

603
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:48,542
the past four or five years.

604
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:49,917
Your mid-life crisis.

605
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:52,292
You'd fuck a catcher's mitt.

606
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:59,126
On everything I hold sacred,

607
00:30:59,209 --> 00:31:01,459
on my children,

608
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:04,209
there's nothin' goin' on
between me and Adriana.

609
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,168
Tony walked away
without a scratch,

610
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:21,834
<i>but Adriana suffered
a severe blow to the head.</i>

611
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:25,750
Adriana got caught givin'
the big guy a blow job.

612
00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:27,709
And when the paramedics
found them,

613
00:31:27,792 --> 00:31:30,209
she had his cock
still in her mouth.

614
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:33,375
Well, a statistic shows that
most single-car fatalities

615
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:34,876
are the result of guys

616
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,459
<i>popping their load
behind the wheel.</i>

617
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:39,876
Apparently, he came
all over the sun visor.

618
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:44,209
Sanseverino.

619
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:46,750
Guess who went down
on Tony Soprano.

620
00:31:48,292 --> 00:31:49,750
That's the truth. It's fact.

621
00:31:51,292 --> 00:31:53,333
If it was my old lady,
the next thing she'd suck

622
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:54,977
is a tailpipe.
- That pretty little trim

623
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:57,209
can suck this pipe
anytime she wants.

624
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:58,500
Like you'd ever have a shot.

625
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,667
Hey, let me tell you somethin'.

626
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,333
When Christopher was in rehab,

627
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:04,417
she was callin' me all the time.

628
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,750
I was this close.

629
00:32:05,834 --> 00:32:07,084
Then you got a problem,

630
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,888
'cause your <i>braciole's</i>
isn't even that long.

631
00:32:15,168 --> 00:32:17,375
- What's so funny?
- Nothin'.

632
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:20,459
Didn't sound like nothin'.
I wanna hear the big joke.

633
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:22,876
- Take it easy.
We're just shootin' the shit.

634
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:25,292
We were just talkin'
about my <i>braciole.</i>

635
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:26,625
Oh, yeah, what about it?

636
00:32:26,709 --> 00:32:28,209
So, deal you in, huh?

637
00:32:28,292 --> 00:32:30,542
I asked him a fuckin' question.

638
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:33,667
What are you breakin'
my balls for?

639
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,168
I want a fuckin' answer.

640
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,625
What's so fuckin' hilarious,
you fuckin' parade float?

641
00:32:37,709 --> 00:32:38,959
Ho!

642
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:40,709
I'm a fuckin' captain now.

643
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,417
You don't talk to me like that!

644
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,876
Oh, come on, guys.

645
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:45,333
Don't put your hands on me!

646
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:46,537
Chrissy, for Chrissakes...

647
00:32:46,542 --> 00:32:47,459
Fuck all of youse.

648
00:32:47,542 --> 00:32:48,959
- Oh whoa, whoa!
- Hey!

649
00:32:49,042 --> 00:32:50,584
Motherfucker!

650
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:51,876
- Hold it.
- Easy.

651
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,667
<i>Vinar, Jimmy, please join me.</i>

652
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:02,292
<i>So talk to me, guys.
How are we feeling in these?</i>

653
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,417
Hey, hon. I already ate.

654
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,666
There's a casserole in the mic--

655
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:07,750
You fuckin' lyin' bitch!

656
00:33:07,834 --> 00:33:10,209
Ow! Stop it!
What are you doing?

657
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:11,917
You were suckin' his cock!

658
00:33:12,001 --> 00:33:13,375
Georgie told me everything!

659
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:14,779
The surgeon
on the operating table

660
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:16,417
said you were moanin'
Tony's name!

661
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,084
What are you talking about?

662
00:33:18,168 --> 00:33:19,709
Fuckin' lie to me!

663
00:33:19,792 --> 00:33:21,152
What were you doin'
in Dover, then?

664
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:22,250
See?

665
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,417
See? You can't tell me,

666
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,209
'cause I know
what you were doin'!

667
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:26,532
Your other dope dealer's there.

668
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:28,375
I remembered. Go ahead, deny it!

669
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:29,542
Okay!

670
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:30,959
I was goin' out to see Andre,

671
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,001
but I wasn't suckin'
anybody's cock!

672
00:33:33,084 --> 00:33:34,584
How could you say that?

673
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:36,042
Oh, so you two
were just gonna go

674
00:33:36,126 --> 00:33:38,834
toot up a bunch of lines,
go fuckin' bird-watchin'?

675
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:40,001
Oh, you son of a bitch.

676
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,459
I was gonna stay up all night

677
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:43,542
and clean this fuckin' shithole!

678
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:45,126
Everybody knows about it!

679
00:33:45,209 --> 00:33:47,168
Everybody's talkin' about it!

680
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:49,709
No, please!

681
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:51,000
You want me to use, you bitch!

682
00:33:51,001 --> 00:33:52,084
You're fuckin' killin' me!

683
00:33:52,168 --> 00:33:54,709
No, I don't! I love you!

684
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,084
Stop it.

685
00:33:59,459 --> 00:34:01,375
- You motherfucker!
- Fuckin' whore.

686
00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:04,667
Ow!

687
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,459
Ow! My neck!

688
00:34:06,542 --> 00:34:09,500
Get the fuck outta here!

689
00:34:09,584 --> 00:34:11,792
I never wanna see you again!

690
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:46,876
I thought you had
an algebra test.

691
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,584
Oh, chill out.

692
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:50,168
What did you say?

693
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:53,679
L-look, I studied
for 45 minutes straight.

694
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,084
Don't I get a break?

695
00:34:58,084 --> 00:34:59,917
Hey.

696
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:01,584
What's up?

697
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:03,709
A.J., how's it goin'?

698
00:35:03,792 --> 00:35:05,834
Hey, Uncle Tony.

699
00:35:06,917 --> 00:35:08,209
Did I come at a bad time?

700
00:35:08,292 --> 00:35:09,375
I need to talk to you.

701
00:35:11,584 --> 00:35:13,001
AJ, go upstairs.

702
00:35:13,084 --> 00:35:14,375
Study.

703
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:15,917
Well, what about the pizza?

704
00:35:16,001 --> 00:35:17,542
Now.

705
00:35:22,417 --> 00:35:23,542
Study.

706
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:35,333
All right, what's up?

707
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:36,875
I went to the Belleville
Tavern after work,

708
00:35:36,876 --> 00:35:38,333
and Larry down there said

709
00:35:38,417 --> 00:35:41,001
our little cousin was
in there all fucked up.

710
00:35:41,084 --> 00:35:43,375
Somebody told him what
was goin' on in the car.

711
00:35:43,459 --> 00:35:45,209
Was nothin' goin' on in the car.

712
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:47,333
No, of course not,
but he thinks there was,

713
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:49,584
so he started drinkin' again,
and he beat up Adriana,

714
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:52,001
and he threw her out
of the fuckin' house.

715
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:54,542
Where's his fuckin'
self-control, this guy?

716
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:55,833
Little Paulie's out there
lookin' for him

717
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:57,209
to reign him in,

718
00:35:57,292 --> 00:35:59,584
but he was sayin' some
crazy things about you.

719
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:03,126
Oh, this goddamn kid.

720
00:36:04,084 --> 00:36:05,666
Christopher's not right
in the head, Ton'.

721
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:08,750
I mean, who the fuck knows
what he's capable of?

722
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,834
Well, he knows where to find me.

723
00:36:10,917 --> 00:36:13,834
You see him, you tell him that.

724
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:16,084
Gotta use your john.

725
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,209
Get you a day early, huh?

726
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:28,333
I'll go to the store
in the morning.

727
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:29,459
Look, relax, all right?

728
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:31,500
Go whenever you want.

729
00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:41,792
What the hell is wrong with him?

730
00:36:41,876 --> 00:36:42,917
What do you want, Tony?

731
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:44,584
He couldn't
bring this in himself?

732
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:46,750
What, I can't even
come in and say hello?

733
00:36:46,834 --> 00:36:48,584
What you want
is to know if I heard

734
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:50,333
the disgusting shit
they're saying.

735
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,500
At least have the guts
to come out and ask me.

736
00:36:52,584 --> 00:36:53,584
It isn't true.

737
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:55,168
You know what? Fuck you!

738
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,959
Fuck me? Fuck you!

739
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:58,417
You gotta put your son in hiding

740
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,084
because of your
fucking philandering?

741
00:37:00,168 --> 00:37:01,708
Afraid he'll get
caught in the crossfire?

742
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:02,876
Your own son?

743
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:04,279
Christopher's upset, that's all.

744
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:05,375
He could come over.

745
00:37:05,459 --> 00:37:06,750
He could say some things

746
00:37:06,834 --> 00:37:08,168
that a kid shouldn't hear.

747
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,417
Just please leave.

748
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,168
I don't even wanna look at you.

749
00:37:56,459 --> 00:37:58,584
Motherfucker!

750
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,042
Motherfucking gun!

751
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:21,500
Give me two.

752
00:38:21,584 --> 00:38:23,584
This kid ain't gonna show up, T.

753
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:24,876
He's probably in some gutter.

754
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:27,250
Yeah, hopefully
he's wore himself down.

755
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:28,625
Where are you, you fuck?

756
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:30,459
He's got a gun!

757
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,459
I know you're up there,
you motherfucker!

758
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:34,542
Why don't you come out--

759
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:36,001
You know what to do down there!

760
00:38:36,084 --> 00:38:37,375
Fuckin' lucky!

761
00:38:37,459 --> 00:38:39,917
You're fuckin' lucky
I ran outta loads!

762
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:41,292
Shut up, you little cock,

763
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:43,042
or I'll split
your fuckin' wishbone.

764
00:38:43,126 --> 00:38:44,417
It's all over.

765
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,917
Everybody... enjoy the evening.

766
00:38:47,001 --> 00:38:48,667
Unhappy customer.

767
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:18,459
Let me the fuck go!

768
00:39:18,542 --> 00:39:20,001
I'll kill all of youse!

769
00:39:20,084 --> 00:39:21,959
Fuckin' kill all of youse!

770
00:39:24,584 --> 00:39:27,500
Ahh...

771
00:39:27,584 --> 00:39:30,209
You draw down on the boss
of a fuckin' family?

772
00:39:30,292 --> 00:39:31,500
Huh?

773
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,126
You lied to me!

774
00:39:33,209 --> 00:39:34,834
You were scorin' coke with her!

775
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:37,417
- She admitted it!
- So what?

776
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,333
I can't relieve stress
every once in a while?

777
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:41,250
I don't got enough
fuckin' problems?

778
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:43,126
You sent me to North Carolina

779
00:39:43,209 --> 00:39:45,584
so you could fuck my girlfriend!

780
00:39:46,542 --> 00:39:49,209
What kind of fuckin' animal
you think I am, huh?

781
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:51,500
The thought never
even entered my head!

782
00:39:51,584 --> 00:39:53,667
You're a man, you're alone
in a car with her--

783
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,542
You fuckin' pushed me to this.

784
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:57,417
You pushed me to this!

785
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:05,459
Way I see it, Tony,

786
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:07,417
he must've known
the gun was empty.

787
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,084
Look what he pumped
into your car.

788
00:40:09,168 --> 00:40:10,667
What are you tryin'
to say, Paulie?

789
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,625
The fuck you tryin'
to say, Paulie, huh?

790
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:24,250
Either you tell me right now

791
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:25,624
that you can take it
into your heart

792
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:27,375
that I did not do this shit...

793
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:32,584
Or this is as far as we go.

794
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:42,750
Motherfucker.

795
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:44,001
Tony, come on!

796
00:40:44,084 --> 00:40:45,208
Listen to somebody else
for a change.

797
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,333
Fuck him.

798
00:40:46,417 --> 00:40:49,500
Tony, try it my way.

799
00:40:49,584 --> 00:40:51,459
Listen to me.

800
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:19,667
Mr., uh, Sorriano,
what seems to be the matter?

801
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,333
Soprano. I'm fine.

802
00:41:21,417 --> 00:41:23,000
It's my friend, here,
needs to talk to you.

803
00:41:23,001 --> 00:41:24,624
Well, you know where
ER admitting is, right?

804
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:27,750
Look, uh, you got someplace
maybe we could talk?

805
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:29,333
It's 3:00 a.m.,

806
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:31,917
and I just finished
a 17-hour rotation.

807
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:35,250
Any gunshot wounds
or broken kneecaps?

808
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:39,959
Two minutes.

809
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:41,584
You're an excellent doctor.

810
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:43,333
That's why I brought him here.

811
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,792
Come on.

812
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:56,250
This gentleman here
is the fiancé

813
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:58,834
of the young lady
that I was with.

814
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:01,001
Now, he's got it into his head

815
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:02,667
that there was oral sex goin' on

816
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,001
at the time of the wreck.

817
00:42:04,084 --> 00:42:05,959
- Listen, I--
- Hey, hey, hey!

818
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:10,584
Just a second.

819
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:13,375
Now, naturally, he's very upset,

820
00:42:13,459 --> 00:42:15,917
so I need you to tell him
there wasn't.

821
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:17,667
He's obviously
feelin' the pressure.

822
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,625
He's just gonna fuckin' lie.

823
00:42:19,709 --> 00:42:24,542
I'm not in the custom
of lying about anything,

824
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:29,959
but whether somebody was
getting something in the car,

825
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:31,750
how could I possibly
attest to that?

826
00:42:31,834 --> 00:42:33,542
Well, as the attending,
you could explain

827
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:35,375
how medically,
it's not possible.

828
00:42:35,459 --> 00:42:37,333
- Excuse me?
- Well for instance,

829
00:42:37,417 --> 00:42:39,332
if she was wearing a seatbelt,
then there would have been

830
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:41,168
abrasions to the lateral
anterior aspect

831
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,001
of the clavicle, wouldn't there?

832
00:42:43,084 --> 00:42:44,876
Or the right mid-sternum?

833
00:42:44,959 --> 00:42:46,417
Are you a physician?

834
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,834
No, I'm a pre-board certified
massage therapist.

835
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:54,750
So did she have any
of those kind of things?

836
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:56,168
Actually, yes,

837
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,876
on the right clavicle
and the sternum

838
00:42:57,959 --> 00:43:00,459
just above the xiphoid
process, which...

839
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:02,542
would indicate
an upright position

840
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:04,001
at the moment of impact.

841
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:07,001
So what he's sayin'
is that she was sittin' up.

842
00:43:10,584 --> 00:43:11,667
All right.

843
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,917
Thank you, doctor. Come on.

844
00:43:15,792 --> 00:43:17,876
For the kids,
the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

845
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:19,250
Whatever, here.

846
00:43:21,709 --> 00:43:23,333
Thank you!

847
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:29,250
What do you want from me?

848
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:31,250
I guess I believe you.

849
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:38,876
You threw food at Vito.

850
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:40,209
That's gotta be resolved.

851
00:43:40,292 --> 00:43:42,917
He was fuckin' laughin',
which was wrong.

852
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:50,750
But at this point, now
it don't make no difference.

853
00:43:53,876 --> 00:43:57,917
Even if it wasn't true,
it's what people think.

854
00:43:58,001 --> 00:44:00,542
They know you were out there
scorin' coke with her.

855
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:02,375
What do you care
what people think?

856
00:44:02,459 --> 00:44:04,084
You know the truth.

857
00:44:04,168 --> 00:44:06,209
I gotta live in the world.

858
00:44:07,625 --> 00:44:10,375
And now I look like Joe Jerkoff.

859
00:44:15,876 --> 00:44:17,168
No-no-no-no.

860
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,709
You know what?

861
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:29,417
I might as well have fucked her.

862
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:32,001
Thanks.

863
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:40,917
Hello?

864
00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:46,209
I rang the doorbell six times.

865
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:47,417
Nobody answered.

866
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,542
What are you doing here?

867
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:50,584
I wanna talk to you.

868
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:52,459
If you came to pick him up,
he's not going.

869
00:44:52,542 --> 00:44:55,292
Oh, so you believe all that
shit they're sayin', huh?

870
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:56,876
Am I that horrible?

871
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,126
Really?

872
00:44:58,209 --> 00:45:00,292
Where there's smoke,
there's fire.

873
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:01,959
I don't know what you did.

874
00:45:02,042 --> 00:45:03,875
What's gonna happen when
your children hear about this?

875
00:45:03,876 --> 00:45:05,584
Meadow already suspects you.

876
00:45:05,667 --> 00:45:06,584
Suspects what?

877
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:07,917
She saw you at the club.

878
00:45:08,001 --> 00:45:09,625
She said she thought
you were coked out.

879
00:45:09,709 --> 00:45:11,167
What are you talkin' about?
I don't do drugs.

880
00:45:11,168 --> 00:45:12,417
She knows about the accident.

881
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,750
What do you think
she's gonna think?

882
00:45:14,834 --> 00:45:16,542
And with Anthony at that age?

883
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:18,042
Oh, come on, the kids!

884
00:45:18,126 --> 00:45:19,542
The kids-- this is about you!

885
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:20,792
Fine, so it's all about me!

886
00:45:20,876 --> 00:45:22,459
What, do I mean nothing to you?

887
00:45:22,542 --> 00:45:25,750
That I gotta live with
this swirlin' around me?

888
00:45:26,917 --> 00:45:28,458
All right, look, forget
about what they're sayin'.

889
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:29,917
I-I'm asking you.

890
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:31,761
You think I'd have
sexual relations with her?

891
00:45:31,834 --> 00:45:34,750
Adriana, who's gonna
be a member of this family?

892
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:40,084
Now, I want you
to answer me truthfully.

893
00:45:42,126 --> 00:45:44,667
Look, I-I know I haven't been
a fuckin' saint, all right,

894
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:48,959
and you got plenty of issues
of your own on that subject...

895
00:45:49,042 --> 00:45:51,876
but you haven't exactly
been a fuckin' saint yourself.

896
00:45:56,417 --> 00:45:58,876
No, no-no-no-no. Come here.

897
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:05,001
You think I would go near
that girl like that?

898
00:46:16,709 --> 00:46:17,917
Thank you.

899
00:46:23,792 --> 00:46:25,542
Look, I'm askin' you
to pull with me

900
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:27,375
to put a good face
on this thing,

901
00:46:27,459 --> 00:46:30,126
for the sake of the kids
and their--and this family.

902
00:46:30,209 --> 00:46:32,209
I gotta bail you out?

903
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:36,375
It is never-ending,
your bullshit.

904
00:46:55,542 --> 00:46:57,709
Use a fuckin' crosswalk!

905
00:47:09,001 --> 00:47:11,168
Jesus Christ.

906
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,209
Don't get all excited.

907
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:16,375
Most of it's from the accident.

908
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,001
You okay?

909
00:47:18,084 --> 00:47:20,500
What do you fuckin' think?

910
00:47:20,584 --> 00:47:23,084
Kicked out of my house,
I may have ulcerative colitis,

911
00:47:23,168 --> 00:47:25,709
and you call me up.

912
00:47:25,792 --> 00:47:27,168
We'd like your permission

913
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,876
to put a listening device
in your business.

914
00:47:29,959 --> 00:47:32,500
This relationship with Tony
could net us a lot of chatter.

915
00:47:32,584 --> 00:47:34,168
Don't forget
it's him we're after.

916
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,834
There is no relationship!

917
00:47:36,917 --> 00:47:38,709
The faster we get Tony
and put him away,

918
00:47:38,792 --> 00:47:41,459
the sooner you can
get on with your life.

919
00:47:41,542 --> 00:47:44,459
We can get a court order
to install a device anyway,

920
00:47:44,542 --> 00:47:46,542
but this'll make
our lives simpler.

921
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:48,001
Fuck you.

922
00:47:48,084 --> 00:47:49,625
I do enough for you people.

923
00:47:49,709 --> 00:47:51,250
You're not buggin' my club.

924
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:56,584
Adriana, it's a syndrome,
protecting abusers.

925
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,208
If it would've been
Christopher alone

926
00:48:01,209 --> 00:48:04,876
in a car with a woman,
I would've killed him.

927
00:48:36,542 --> 00:48:39,917
Arthur's sending something
over, with his compliments.

928
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:41,126
Thank you.

929
00:48:48,834 --> 00:48:49,834
Thank you.

930
00:48:52,292 --> 00:48:53,625
Enjoy.

931
00:48:59,417 --> 00:49:00,876
I'm gonna go over there.

932
00:49:10,126 --> 00:49:11,126
Nice to see you, Ton.

933
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:12,333
Oh, thank you.

934
00:49:13,792 --> 00:49:16,042
- Gravy's good tonight.
- Oh?

935
00:49:26,209 --> 00:49:28,209
Nice to see you.

936
00:49:28,292 --> 00:49:30,417
Hope you have
a pleasant evening.

937
00:49:38,917 --> 00:49:40,584
Ladies.
