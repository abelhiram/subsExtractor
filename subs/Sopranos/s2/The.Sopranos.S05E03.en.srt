Here he is, Mr. Clean.

32
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:55,826
Want some coffee?

33
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:57,459
Where's your dirties?

34
00:01:57,542 --> 00:01:58,992
I'll get 'em.

35
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:11,875
What?

36
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:14,709
I don't know, it's, it's...

37
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:16,709
It's hard seein' you like this.

38
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:18,792
What, workin', with a real job?

39
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,500
It's like I been tellin' Feech,
it's been a long strange trip.

40
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:27,209
Feech.

41
00:02:32,126 --> 00:02:34,251
Anyway, it's the luck
of the draw, that shit.

42
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:38,042
Could've just as easily
been me that went away.

43
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,834
Come on, I was gonna be there
that night of the hijack.

44
00:02:41,617 --> 00:02:44,376
Well, it ain't like you
came away totally unscathed.

45
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,583
No, a couple of goons jumped me
and cut my head open.

46
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:51,418
I couldn't go. Still...

47
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,418
They could've killed ya.

48
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,583
- You ended up in the E.R.
- Got 16 stitches.

49
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:58,167
You got 15 years.

50
00:02:58,251 --> 00:02:59,684
You always were a lucky fuck.

51
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:01,450
Well, that's not
completely true.

52
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:03,542
I got other sorrows in my life.

53
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,142
Like him, for example.

54
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:24,209
- Thanks for lunch.
- Stick with me, kid,

55
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:26,251
I'll have ya eatin' lunch
like that every day.

56
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,959
I'm serious about
this massage therapy.

57
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:33,251
Well, you should keep a square
job like that, for appearances.

58
00:03:33,334 --> 00:03:36,000
Look at me with the bakery.

59
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:38,867
I told my cousin
I wanna stay a civilian.

60
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:40,418
Ah, yes.

61
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,125
The boy king.

62
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,509
Can I trust you if I talk to you
frankly about him?

63
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:00,792
What are you doin'?

64
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,583
I gotta make a stop.

65
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,500
The fuck you doin'?!

66
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,959
- Excuse me?
- What the fuck you doin'?

67
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:25,750
I'm trimmin' a lawn.

68
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:28,251
My nephew does the lawns
in this neighborhood.

69
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,750
I been workin' this
neighborhood for 26 years.

70
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:32,126
Are you fuckin' deaf?

71
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:33,875
I said my nephew has this area.

72
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,209
Gary La Manna.

73
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:36,800
Fuck off, huh?

74
00:04:36,884 --> 00:04:38,292
I'm busy here.

75
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:45,542
You want me to fuck off?!

76
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:49,542
How about I fuck off all over
your stupid fuckin' face?!

77
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,000
You fuckin' mutt, huh?

78
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:02,350
You don't work
this neighborhood!

79
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:06,875
Jesus Christ, we're on parole.

80
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,659
The fuck you doin'?

81
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,334
Anthony said the cable box
has to be on.

82
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,084
It's on, I'm doin' it.

83
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:22,334
<i>But let me tell ya,
our glass house couples</i>

84
00:05:22,418 --> 00:05:24,875
<i>could probably decorate
in about 24 hours.</i>

85
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,209
<i>They have to. Each week...</i>

86
00:05:31,851 --> 00:05:33,600
<i>Tony's whole life was horses...</i>

87
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,625
<i>- No, it's not her.
- That's Judy!</i>

88
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:38,418
<i>- No, it's not Judy.</i>
- The fuck.

89
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,100
<i>Yes, it is, of course it is.</i>

90
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:42,251
- Why am I on there?
<i>- Holy shit.</i>

91
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:44,500
- What?
<i>- I've seen Judy, that's Judy.</i>

92
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,750
- That's not you.
<i>- Judy has brown eyes.</i>

93
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:48,583
What's that, my trial?

94
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:50,624
<i>- You don't know the eyes.</i>
<i>- No, I do know the eyes--</i>

95
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,750
<i>Come on! I see my
daughter call her Judy!</i>

96
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:53,834
<i>Sweet Judy brown eyes...</i>

97
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,750
That's Bobby.

98
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:57,542
The fuck is this?

99
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:01,376
Junior, this is not you,
it's a TV program.

100
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:02,709
A movie.

101
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:05,792
<i>- Judy.
- What?</i>

102
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,875
Ton'.

103
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,000
He's here.

104
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:25,676
Tony, hey, thanks for seein' me.

105
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:28,367
How are ya?

106
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,534
So you want somethin',
uh, coffee? Bialy?

107
00:06:34,617 --> 00:06:36,283
Nah, I'm good, thanks.

108
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:42,842
What's on your mind?

109
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,418
Well, honestly,
I'll get right to the point.

110
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,459
As regards to your uncle,
'cause of the promotion and all,

111
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,750
I kinda thought I'd be
out on the street more.

112
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:58,209
Stayin' off the street nowadays
is a good thing, no?

113
00:06:58,992 --> 00:07:00,542
It's a joke.

114
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,500
I know. I mean,
I'm not complainin'.

115
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,376
It's just it's over a year,

116
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:06,167
and I'm still pickin' up
prescriptions.

117
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:07,300
What do ya need, money?

118
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:09,284
I mean, all I want's a chance to earn.

119
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:10,617
I mean, I'm happy to do it,

120
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,992
it's just 40 minutes I spent
at Rite Aids yesterday

121
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:16,292
gettin' him some stool softener
that was on sale.

122
00:07:16,376 --> 00:07:18,359
With Jan and the kids
to feed now...

123
00:07:18,442 --> 00:07:20,109
How's she doin', anyways?

124
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:22,126
My sister.

125
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,459
She sleeps a lot.

126
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:24,667
It's hard.

127
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,459
Still with the Epstein-Barr, huh?

128
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:28,459
It's tough on her. I don't know.

129
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:30,750
Two kids, a ready-made family.

130
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,542
She's prone to depression,
frankly.

131
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,042
Mm.

132
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:38,000
I mean, not that
I have any regrets.

133
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:41,334
No, no, of course not,
she's a good kid.

134
00:07:42,218 --> 00:07:45,342
Look, Bobby, marriage...

135
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,225
or any partnership
for that matter,

136
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:49,151
is a give and a take.

137
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,475
All right, look...

138
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:57,034
I hear what you're sayin',

139
00:07:57,118 --> 00:07:59,400
but the truth is
I depend on you.

140
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,959
Beppy? Tommy? Come on.

141
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:05,459
You're the only one
I can trust over there.

142
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:08,583
And believe it or not, it's
important to me that he's cared for.

143
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,392
All right, let me figure out
how to take care of you.

144
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,734
Maybe you could make more
collections or somethin'.

145
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,167
Thanks, Ton'.

146
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,959
I appreciate it.

147
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:24,334
Yeah, all right.

148
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:27,383
All right.

149
00:08:33,534 --> 00:08:35,951
And Friday we have fish--

150
00:08:36,334 --> 00:08:39,167
if you're Catholic--
so that's nice.

151
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:40,917
- Sounds like the Ritz.
- Mm.

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,418
Ya gotta see her, Aunt Mary,

153
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,625
she's the belle of the ball
over there.

154
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:47,583
Here, Ma, rest those dogs.

155
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,292
Hey, what's goin' on?

156
00:08:56,376 --> 00:08:57,709
Nobody cuttin' the lawn?

157
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:00,709
Oh, Marone. Mr. Vitro,
the gardener?

158
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:03,292
Somebody beat him up,
broke his arm.

159
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,751
God forbid.

160
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:07,192
Sal Vitro? Who beat him up?

161
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:08,834
Some men in a Cadillac.

162
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:11,500
He was mowin' a lawn
on Kimball Street.

163
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,000
Man said he didn't want him
in the neighborhood.

164
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:16,583
Poor Sal, what a nice man he is.

165
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:20,209
He put my garbage cans out
every time he cut my grass.

166
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:21,876
What's his name, Aunt Mary?

167
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,280
- Salvatore Vitro.
- Ma!

168
00:09:24,304 --> 00:09:26,142
The guy that beat him up!

169
00:09:27,026 --> 00:09:29,817
Man came by and said
he was gonna cut the lawns.

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,717
I said, "No, I want Mr. Vitro."

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,209
E. Gary La Manna Landscapin'.

172
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:37,792
Do you know him?

173
00:09:38,175 --> 00:09:39,709
Eat your scones.

174
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:41,592
I'll straighten it out.

175
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,934
<i>95.5, WPLJ in Brooklyn.</i>

176
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:50,917
Sorry, we're not open.

177
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,625
What not open?

178
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:55,834
A man in your position turn
away fuckin' business now?

179
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:58,042
I didn't know
it was you, Lorraine.

180
00:09:58,126 --> 00:10:01,000
Here ya go. That's most of it.

181
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:06,867
Let me ask you a question, Dan.

182
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:10,376
Say I'm some big nigger
standing here, instead of a woman.

183
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:12,459
You still gonna tell me
you got most of it?

184
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:14,709
Let's go, chop-chop.
Pay the woman.

185
00:10:24,076 --> 00:10:25,409
Phil, hey.

186
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,709
I was just thinkin' about you.

187
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:29,375
Those Islander tickets, right?

188
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,084
How about this humidity?

189
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:33,034
Hey!

190
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:36,750
Guys, please, whatever this is--

191
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:38,459
Shut up.

192
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:42,376
Two times you were told to
kick up to fuckin' Johnny Sack.

193
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:44,209
And what do you do, huh?

194
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:45,458
You kick up to Little Carmine?

195
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:47,667
- Tape her.
- No, no!

196
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,750
Little Carmine,
he was my father's friend!

197
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:53,251
Philly, Joey, look,
Okay. Okay. Okay.

198
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:55,292
You're right, I'm sorry,
I'll pay you, okay?

199
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:58,334
I'll do anything you want.
I'll suck your cock, okay?

200
00:10:58,418 --> 00:11:00,559
All of you guys!

201
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:02,992
- You'll suck our cocks?
- Yeah!

202
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:06,225
She any good?

203
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:08,767
What am I askin' you for?
You probably showed her how.

204
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,775
- Shut up.
- Please, guys.

205
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,984
Relax.

206
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:14,126
This'll muffle the shot.

207
00:11:16,251 --> 00:11:18,376
Adios, you fuckin' skank!

208
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:27,251
Hey, look at this, Joey.

209
00:11:27,334 --> 00:11:29,418
Today's her lucky day.

210
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,292
Only made it to the R's.

211
00:11:32,376 --> 00:11:35,917
Next time...
there'll be no next time.

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,583
Come on.

213
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:44,042
Take as long
as you like, no rush.

214
00:11:44,126 --> 00:11:45,575
I've got my Times crossword

215
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:47,534
and Agnes here will get you
anything you need.

216
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:49,875
Thanks, Mel.

217
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,917
So how's it bein' home, Angelo?

218
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,084
Enjoyin' livin'
with your daughter?

219
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,959
It's like paradise.

220
00:11:57,042 --> 00:12:00,000
I eat like a pharaoh,
I got my own room, cable TV.

221
00:12:00,084 --> 00:12:01,626
I have cable.

222
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:03,325
My grandson,
he asked me, he says,

223
00:12:03,409 --> 00:12:05,325
how come he never met
his grandpa before?

224
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:08,450
I said, "Because Grandpa's
been in Special Forces."

225
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:10,334
First he was afraid of me.

226
00:12:10,418 --> 00:12:12,083
But I said, "Come on,
we'll get some ice cream,

227
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:13,459
we'll go to the park,
it'll be--"

228
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:17,251
- Well, anyway, here we all are.
- Right.

229
00:12:17,334 --> 00:12:20,659
I called you boys because
Lorraine calls me and she said

230
00:12:20,742 --> 00:12:23,325
there's a situation in our
family that's gotten outta hand

231
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,059
with John and Little Carmine.

232
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:26,359
This fuckin' Johnny.

233
00:12:26,442 --> 00:12:28,317
He wouldn't even let
the maggots get on Carmine

234
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,900
before he's tellin' me
to kick up direct to him.

235
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,934
Problem is, Carmine
never named a successor.

236
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,018
Now, we all assumed
it'd be Johnny 'cause the, uh,

237
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,267
son's down in Miami with
the discos and the whatnot.

238
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,600
He's grabbin'
with both hands, John.

239
00:12:40,684 --> 00:12:41,934
This could get ugly.

240
00:12:42,018 --> 00:12:44,350
There's a lot of potential...

241
00:12:44,434 --> 00:12:46,059
for bloodshed.

242
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:47,475
Potential?

243
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,767
They almost killed us.

244
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,934
Jason, men are talking here.

245
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:54,976
Now, you're close to John.

246
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:57,892
- You have any ideas?
- What are you askin' him for?

247
00:12:57,976 --> 00:13:01,125
He never even had the makin's
of a varsity athlete.

248
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,183
Your point bein' what, Junior?

249
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:08,467
Oh, forget it, he's j--
he's just breakin' balls.

250
00:13:10,717 --> 00:13:15,218
All right, one thought I had
in the interest of harmony...

251
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,634
maybe there could be
a power-sharin' situation.

252
00:13:17,717 --> 00:13:19,842
The Sopranos have two bosses.

253
00:13:19,926 --> 00:13:22,092
That's not all it's cracked up
to be, believe you me.

254
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,300
Let's not get into that
right now. Okay?

255
00:13:28,383 --> 00:13:30,009
What I was thinkin'
was three bosses,

256
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:32,717
a triumvir-thing, like Caesar.

257
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,134
Little Carmine, Johnny and you.

258
00:13:35,218 --> 00:13:36,509
I'm retired.

259
00:13:36,592 --> 00:13:38,466
You were Carmine's consigliere
for over 30 years.

260
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:40,341
If it wasn't for that little
construction beef down in Yonkers,

261
00:13:40,342 --> 00:13:42,342
it'd be you runnin'
that family today.

262
00:13:42,425 --> 00:13:44,467
Things happen how they happen.

263
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,550
Think about it.

264
00:13:46,634 --> 00:13:47,926
Doesn't have to be nine-to-five.

265
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:50,342
You could still take
your grandson to the park.

266
00:13:51,225 --> 00:13:54,767
Things get heavy, you're just
another voice to weigh in.

267
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:57,259
And John still does
better financially

268
00:13:57,342 --> 00:13:59,800
than he ever did under Carmine.

269
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,884
There he is.

270
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:07,517
Salvatore, my Dali.

271
00:14:15,842 --> 00:14:17,092
My aunt told me about it.

272
00:14:17,176 --> 00:14:19,300
I mean, what'd I ever do
to this guy?

273
00:14:19,383 --> 00:14:21,717
They released
these fucks from the can--

274
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,592
obviously, he wasn't
rehabilitated.

275
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:26,675
There's my livelihood.

276
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:29,550
I don't have a yard no more,
Sally, I'm in a condo.

277
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:33,051
Otherwise, you know, I'd have
ya out there with your snippers,

278
00:14:33,134 --> 00:14:34,934
even with your bum wing.

279
00:14:35,218 --> 00:14:37,967
My wife, at this point...

280
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:40,425
she's got me thinkin'
about goin' to the cops.

281
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:42,218
What are you talkin' about?

282
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,509
Where you from?

283
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:46,550
I don't know what to do.

284
00:14:46,634 --> 00:14:48,550
You got friends, don't ya?

285
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:50,509
Well, you know I always
steered clear of stuff.

286
00:14:50,592 --> 00:14:51,634
What stuff?

287
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:53,051
I go, I talk to the guy for ya.

288
00:14:53,134 --> 00:14:55,092
Get you back your stops.

289
00:14:55,176 --> 00:14:56,259
I know him.

290
00:14:58,425 --> 00:14:59,218
Yeah?

291
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,425
So you give me a token.

292
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:02,717
I don't know, couple percent.

293
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:10,342
Thanks, Paulie.

294
00:15:14,051 --> 00:15:16,467
This one and the next one.

295
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:32,083
There he is,
the king of breadsticks.

296
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:34,800
I'll give ya a breadstick
up your ass. Come here.

297
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,934
Hey.

298
00:15:38,717 --> 00:15:40,009
Come on. Sit down.

299
00:15:44,092 --> 00:15:47,884
So... how's the kid, huh? Tony.

300
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,259
He's good, you know.

301
00:15:49,342 --> 00:15:52,183
But ask me, he should've
stood with Carmela.

302
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:53,926
Some men need wives, huh.

303
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:55,966
Tell you when to shit
and when to scratch your ass.

304
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:57,725
Who needs 'em, huh?

305
00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:00,259
What can I do for ya, Paul?

306
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:03,509
I got a guy, I think
you may have run into him.

307
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:05,425
Gardener name of Sal Vitro?

308
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:07,759
Does my aunt's grass.

309
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,884
He says your nephew's
movin' into his neighborhood,

310
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:12,842
- Franklin Parkway.
- His neighborhood.

311
00:16:12,926 --> 00:16:15,133
He's been workin' there since
back when I lived there even.

312
00:16:15,134 --> 00:16:17,592
Anyway, I'm here puttin'
in a word for the kid.

313
00:16:17,675 --> 00:16:18,967
So do me a favor, huh?

314
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:21,800
You and your nephew
over there, lay off.

315
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:27,425
Hey, biscott'.

316
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:29,167
No.

317
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:33,218
You know Mr. Jerry, the fruit,
owns those hair salons, huh?

318
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,926
He came to me the other day.

319
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:36,967
He asked me to take
his action on the Knicks.

320
00:16:38,926 --> 00:16:40,884
Jerry's my fuckin' customer.

321
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,218
For years now.

322
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,051
Which is why I told him no.

323
00:16:44,134 --> 00:16:46,092
This fuckin' gardener, Paulie,

324
00:16:46,176 --> 00:16:47,926
he cut the hair
on your balls, too?

325
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:49,467
He's a friend of my Aunt Mary's.

326
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,092
Which is why he don't
belong to nobody.

327
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,509
Well, what do you know
about who belongs to what?

328
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:55,300
You been away 20 fuckin' years!

329
00:16:55,383 --> 00:16:56,759
Which entitles me to earn!

330
00:16:56,842 --> 00:16:58,550
Which entitles you to shit.

331
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:01,176
In my book, you get points
for stayin' outta the can.

332
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:04,667
Good thing for me, then, that
your book don't mean <i>ugatz</i> to me!

333
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:07,425
What's yours is yours, Paulie,

334
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:09,300
but what ain't
is anybody else's!

335
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:11,509
Now do yourself a fuckin' favor

336
00:17:11,592 --> 00:17:14,051
and get the fuck outta my store!

337
00:17:24,592 --> 00:17:27,699
So we're pickin' Bobby up, or
he's gonna meet us at Uncle Jun's?

338
00:17:27,717 --> 00:17:29,926
He took the kids
to the 12 o'clock mass.

339
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,218
I didn't know he was religious.

340
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,926
At this point
he'll try anything, I guess.

341
00:17:37,009 --> 00:17:39,717
Bobby Jr. started
wetting his bed again.

342
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,759
Practically every night.

343
00:17:41,842 --> 00:17:43,842
Bobby came by
to see me the other day.

344
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:46,383
Really?

345
00:17:49,092 --> 00:17:52,051
So we discuss his career.
I'm his wife.

346
00:17:52,134 --> 00:17:54,051
Sometimes he needs a push.

347
00:17:54,134 --> 00:17:55,800
Well Junior's your uncle too,

348
00:17:55,884 --> 00:17:57,799
in case you wanna play a little
more of an active role--

349
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,051
I try, believe me.

350
00:18:00,134 --> 00:18:03,176
Despite all the work
I have with my own family.

351
00:18:06,383 --> 00:18:10,134
You know, Tony, I cook for Bobby
and the kids every night.

352
00:18:10,218 --> 00:18:11,842
I did Sunday dinner at my house,

353
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:13,425
and now I gotta
prepare the starters

354
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,717
and schlep 'em to Uncle Jun's.

355
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,018
Yeah, Barb's helpin' out
all the way down from Brewster.

356
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,225
Barbara's kids are normal.

357
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:24,634
This family stuff,
these Sunday dinners--

358
00:18:24,717 --> 00:18:26,717
they're important, Janice.

359
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,634
Hey, Jan.

360
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:32,884
Julio, help me get this order?

361
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:34,300
Okay.

362
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:40,550
You know, every day

363
00:18:40,634 --> 00:18:43,134
I understand more and more
what Ma went through.

364
00:18:43,218 --> 00:18:45,383
I mean, we bitch about her,
but I tell you,

365
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:48,884
it is less and less a mystery
why she was the way she was.

366
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:50,509
She chose to be that way.

367
00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:52,717
You don't choose that, Tony.

368
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,218
An ungrateful husband,
selfish kids...

369
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,425
How's all the food
that Janice prepared?

370
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:02,009
Two more minutes. Artie's
re-sautéing the mushrooms.

371
00:19:02,092 --> 00:19:04,009
Could I get you guys
a glass of wine?

372
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:05,842
- Somethin' to drink?
- No, I'm good.

373
00:19:05,926 --> 00:19:07,967
I'll have a pinot grigio.

374
00:19:13,092 --> 00:19:15,176
Twenty minutes,
start the shells.

375
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,842
Just redoin' the mushrooms.
Uh, two minutes, tops.

376
00:19:25,926 --> 00:19:28,634
Well relax, I just, uh...

377
00:19:28,717 --> 00:19:30,383
came in to say hello.

378
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,717
So how ya doin'?

379
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,383
Hangin' in.

380
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:43,218
Heard you were over there
at the Motel Six.

381
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,218
My aunt took the house back.

382
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,051
I'm movin' in with my cousin
at the end of the month.

383
00:19:53,717 --> 00:19:56,675
Look, you know, if you want,
I'm stayin' over at my mother's

384
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:58,259
and the place is empty.
You can

385
00:19:58,342 --> 00:20:01,009
bunk with me for a while.

386
00:20:01,092 --> 00:20:02,759
No. Thank you.

387
00:20:02,842 --> 00:20:04,509
I was talkin' to
my cousin, Tony B.,

388
00:20:04,592 --> 00:20:07,134
and he said it's fuckin' stupid
that we're on the outs.

389
00:20:07,818 --> 00:20:09,842
I'm tellin' ya, the place
is just sittin' there.

390
00:20:09,926 --> 00:20:11,592
Two extra bedrooms.

391
00:20:11,675 --> 00:20:13,751
I don't know.

392
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:15,759
Why not?

393
00:20:15,842 --> 00:20:17,092
Artie, we're like brothers.

394
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:19,884
How long are we gonna
hold a grudge?

395
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:24,467
Thanks, Ton'.
Thank you, very much.

396
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,675
Alright.

397
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:28,592
All right.

398
00:20:36,092 --> 00:20:38,425
Uh, listen, uh, I gotta
talk to ya about your linens.

399
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:41,684
You know, the napkins
and tablecloths, all that shit.

400
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:45,550
I got somethin' goin'. I
think I can save ya like 70%.

401
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:53,218
<i>There's been a lot of
progress to the facade.</i>

402
00:20:53,342 --> 00:20:55,634
<i>In some instances,
all of the paint comes off.</i>

403
00:20:55,717 --> 00:20:57,467
<i>Now tell me, what
product is used...</i>

404
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,509
I don't get these
old antique houses.

405
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,218
They're grimy lookin'.

406
00:21:05,134 --> 00:21:06,800
We gonna eat today or what?

407
00:21:06,884 --> 00:21:09,383
Barbara and Tom aren't here yet
with the entrees, Uncle Jun'.

408
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:11,800
When were they supposed to come?

409
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:15,009
Two o'clock, I told you
five minutes ago. Here.

410
00:21:15,092 --> 00:21:16,759
Why don't we start
on the macaroni?

411
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,259
Everybody come on!

412
00:21:19,842 --> 00:21:23,300
Bolognese has meat, obviously,
the marinara doesn't.

413
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:27,092
And Barb'll be here with the
chicken parm and the veal <i>pizzaiol'.</i>

414
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:32,425
So Anthony, how'd you guys do
against Delbarton last season?

415
00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:35,092
Not so good. We lost both times.

416
00:21:35,176 --> 00:21:38,117
- It's that line coach.
- Star-Ledger says Delbarton's

417
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,841
gonna be even tougher this
comin' year with that Chinese kid.

418
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:44,051
Your father never had the
makings of a varsity athlete.

419
00:21:44,134 --> 00:21:45,926
Oh, what the--

420
00:21:48,218 --> 00:21:50,383
What the hell's with you?

421
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:52,383
- What?
- It's not true.

422
00:21:52,467 --> 00:21:53,967
I lettered in football.

423
00:21:54,651 --> 00:21:56,425
You never played college ball.

424
00:21:56,509 --> 00:21:58,134
College?

425
00:21:58,218 --> 00:22:01,300
Those guys from Seton Hall were
seven feet tall, some of them.

426
00:22:01,783 --> 00:22:03,783
Took an academic leave anyway.

427
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,967
Small hands,
that was your problem.

428
00:22:07,051 --> 00:22:10,134
Oh yeah, Daddy always said that.

429
00:22:10,218 --> 00:22:12,667
That's not the point.

430
00:22:13,051 --> 00:22:16,375
What is it with you and this
obsession with this varsity crap?

431
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:18,467
The other day you said it.

432
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,716
And when I was a kid, you told
the girl cousins the same thing.

433
00:22:20,717 --> 00:22:21,967
It was very hurtful.

434
00:22:22,051 --> 00:22:24,051
Tony, relax,
it's not a big deal.

435
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,442
It's undermining.

436
00:22:25,526 --> 00:22:28,467
And it's the kinda stuff
I'm teachin' my kids not to do.

437
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,051
So, I don't wanna hear it again!

438
00:22:30,134 --> 00:22:31,467
End of subject!

439
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:37,717
Honey, pass me
the ricott', please.

440
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,092
- Hello?
- In here!

441
00:22:41,176 --> 00:22:42,675
Hi. Sorry we're late.

442
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:45,218
- The Tappan Zee was a nightmare.
- Checkin' the trucks again.

443
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,425
Well, sit down and dig
into this medley of pastas

444
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:49,092
that Janice whipped up.

445
00:22:49,176 --> 00:22:50,709
How you doin', Uncle Jun'?

446
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:52,876
I don't like tardiness.

447
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:54,717
Let me unwrap these.

448
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,675
- This looks great.
- Thank you.

449
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:58,509
So comin' down
I heard on the radio,

450
00:22:58,592 --> 00:23:00,508
looks like the Jets are gonna
grab that kid from Tulsa.

451
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:02,092
That tight end.

452
00:23:02,176 --> 00:23:04,300
We still get those season
tickets, big brother?

453
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,783
All I know is you never had
the makings of a varsity athlete.

454
00:23:06,842 --> 00:23:08,759
- Aw, son of a bitch!
- What?

455
00:23:08,842 --> 00:23:10,767
Did I just tell you
not to say that again?!

456
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:11,425
Say what?

457
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:13,404
You don't like the way I
talk, get outta my house!

458
00:23:13,428 --> 00:23:14,051
Here we go.

459
00:23:14,134 --> 00:23:15,367
- Tony--
- "Tony," shit!

460
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:17,134
Get your coat. We're leavin'.

461
00:23:17,218 --> 00:23:19,759
- I don't have a coat.
- Then get movin', goddamn it.

462
00:23:19,842 --> 00:23:22,218
Will someone please
tell me what's goin' on?

463
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,259
It's my last Sunday dinner here,
that's what's goin' on.

464
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,759
Uncle Jun', was that
really necessary?

465
00:23:32,842 --> 00:23:36,051
He's a goddamn hothouse flower,
that's his problem.

466
00:23:43,684 --> 00:23:46,459
Thank you for getting
my TV fixed, Paulie.

467
00:23:57,259 --> 00:23:58,800
Such a sin.

468
00:23:58,884 --> 00:24:01,092
He fired his Spanish helper.

469
00:24:01,176 --> 00:24:04,176
Took his boy outta college
'cause he couldn't afford it anymore.

470
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:07,467
He said it's his
last time comin' here.

471
00:24:15,967 --> 00:24:17,342
You speak to the man?

472
00:24:17,425 --> 00:24:18,800
I'll see ya later.

473
00:24:41,634 --> 00:24:43,509
So. What's up?

474
00:24:43,592 --> 00:24:46,467
Nothin', uh, thought we'd be
first in line for openin' day.

475
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,383
Peanuts are on me.

476
00:24:49,467 --> 00:24:52,176
- Angelo Garepe came to see me.
- Mmm-hmm.

477
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:54,176
Lorraine Calluzzo reached out.

478
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,800
Fucking twat.

479
00:24:55,884 --> 00:24:58,467
Didn't you fuck her once?

480
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,634
Yeah, a million years ago.

481
00:25:00,717 --> 00:25:02,517
What, is nothin' a secret?

482
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,051
Obviously you wanna
maintain stability,

483
00:25:05,134 --> 00:25:08,717
but havin' Phil Leotardo smack your
shies around, is that the smartest thing?

484
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,634
I gotta nip this
Little Carmine shit in the bud.

485
00:25:11,717 --> 00:25:14,759
Otherwise I could see a lotta
people start fuckin' around.

486
00:25:14,842 --> 00:25:17,218
Power vacuum,
the capos bide their time,

487
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,675
nobody's sure who to pay,
so nobody gets paid.

488
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,884
All right, I hear ya.

489
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:23,550
No one likes that cunt anyway.

490
00:25:23,634 --> 00:25:25,884
Any problem, she's, "Whack
this one, whack that one."

491
00:25:25,967 --> 00:25:28,051
Never enough body count
for Lorraine.

492
00:25:28,134 --> 00:25:30,176
Fuck her. Let her
taste her own medicine.

493
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:31,675
All right, whatever.

494
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:34,550
I'll tell ya somethin' else.

495
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:37,218
In large measure I blame you for
this shit with Little Carmine.

496
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,743
The fuck did I do?

497
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:40,091
You legitimized him.

498
00:25:40,092 --> 00:25:42,675
Man of your stature goes
to Florida to see that schmuck?

499
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:44,509
All right, come on, huh?
We both agree

500
00:25:44,592 --> 00:25:46,926
that Little Carmine's
a fuckin' asshole.

501
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:48,678
But the fact is,
he's got a followin'

502
00:25:48,702 --> 00:25:51,009
- loyal to his old man.
- So?

503
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,926
So, Angelo had an idea.

504
00:25:56,051 --> 00:25:58,176
What if...

505
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:00,509
and he's just floatin' this
to keep the peace...

506
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:01,967
Mmm-hmm.

507
00:26:02,051 --> 00:26:05,383
...what if there was
a power-sharin' situation?

508
00:26:05,467 --> 00:26:08,550
- Power-sharing.
- You're all in charge equally,

509
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:10,700
but no major decisions
can be made without

510
00:26:10,724 --> 00:26:12,817
- a majority of two.
- What the fuck?

511
00:26:12,842 --> 00:26:15,718
Hey, this way you're not
such a big target for the feds.

512
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,218
Three of the other families
have this kind of arrangement.

513
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,218
What's this,
the fuckin' U.N. now?!

514
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,675
- Alright, forget it! Forget I said it!
- Fuck that!

515
00:26:30,717 --> 00:26:32,300
<i>Everyone deserves</i>

516
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:33,634
<i>To choose how they feel.</i>

517
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,509
<i>To experience the love, the joy,</i>

518
00:26:35,592 --> 00:26:36,752
<i>the happiness, the passion...</i>

519
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,134
Where's Junior?

520
00:26:38,218 --> 00:26:40,051
Upstairs takin' a nap.

521
00:26:40,134 --> 00:26:42,009
The garage is open,
his car is gone.

522
00:26:46,051 --> 00:26:47,300
Where is he?

523
00:26:47,383 --> 00:26:49,926
I'm tellin' ya, I don't know.

524
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:53,051
You don't think somebody
put the snatch on him, do ya?

525
00:26:53,134 --> 00:26:55,759
When did you see him last?

526
00:26:55,842 --> 00:26:57,634
An hour ago? Two?

527
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:01,592
I fell asleep.

528
00:27:01,675 --> 00:27:03,717
Maybe he drove to the store?

529
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,675
His wallet's here, his watch.

530
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:08,967
With his bail, he's not allowed
to leave the house anyway.

531
00:27:09,051 --> 00:27:10,926
Junior.

532
00:27:27,926 --> 00:27:31,259
So when they say they're
not interested, you say,

533
00:27:31,342 --> 00:27:35,634
you're not interested
in keepin' kids off drugs?

534
00:27:35,717 --> 00:27:36,842
What, Shabazz?

535
00:27:36,926 --> 00:27:39,509
Nobody wants them
Turkish taffies.

536
00:27:39,592 --> 00:27:43,550
You push harder. What did I
tell you about profit margin?

537
00:27:43,634 --> 00:27:45,759
- Where's Johnny?
- We closed now.

538
00:27:45,842 --> 00:27:48,800
- Lemme talk to Damiano.
- We rented the hall today.

539
00:27:48,884 --> 00:27:50,800
I'm lookin' for
Johnny Soprano, goddamn it.

540
00:27:50,884 --> 00:27:52,842
Hey! This here's a church!

541
00:27:52,926 --> 00:27:55,218
You can't talk
like that in here.

542
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,425
Get out. Go on.
We're workin' here.

543
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,218
- I wanna see Johnny Soprano.
- Ain't no Johnny here.

544
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,038
I'm his brother, damn it.
He owns this place.

545
00:28:02,062 --> 00:28:03,500
Hold up, now.

546
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:07,009
Back in the day this was
Italian neighborhood.

547
00:28:07,092 --> 00:28:10,509
Some fellas had this place here.
Kept those vending machines.

548
00:28:10,592 --> 00:28:13,592
Well, there ain't no vending
machines here no more.

549
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:15,675
Come on, fool, go on!

550
00:28:33,134 --> 00:28:35,176
All right, Roberta, thanks.

551
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:37,218
I'm sorry to bother you.

552
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,675
Bobbi Sanfillipo?

553
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:43,592
Junior hasn't kept time
with her in years.

554
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:46,926
Yeah, I realize that.

555
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:48,592
You know, now that
I think about it,

556
00:28:48,675 --> 00:28:52,259
Junior was actin' a little
peculiar when I got here today.

557
00:28:52,342 --> 00:28:54,176
Said he wanted to see Johnny.

558
00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:56,134
What Johnny?

559
00:28:56,218 --> 00:28:58,675
- His brother?
- I don't know.

560
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:01,592
Also there the other day,
we were watchin' the TV,

561
00:29:01,675 --> 00:29:05,075
he thought he saw himself
on one of the programs.

562
00:29:06,884 --> 00:29:08,259
<i>...in my home.</i>

563
00:29:08,342 --> 00:29:10,051
<i>We have got
the dishwashing liquid...</i>

564
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:16,800
- Hello?
- Yeah, it's me.

565
00:29:16,884 --> 00:29:18,383
Did you drop off
the dry cleaning?

566
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:20,467
<i>Your uncle's missing,
he took his car.</i>

567
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,550
<i>- He didn't call you, did he?</i>
- No.

568
00:29:22,634 --> 00:29:25,509
- Where the hell is he?
<i>- He's like an old woman, Bobby.</i>

569
00:29:25,592 --> 00:29:27,552
He's probably gossiping
with one of the neighbors.

570
00:29:27,634 --> 00:29:30,967
Did you check
the Ramirezes' next door?

571
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:32,634
<i>I'm afraid he might've wandered.</i>

572
00:29:32,717 --> 00:29:34,550
My grandfather did this.

573
00:29:35,634 --> 00:29:37,800
Maybe you better call Tony.

574
00:29:37,884 --> 00:29:40,092
I can't just dump this on Tony.

575
00:29:40,176 --> 00:29:41,717
I gotta find him.

576
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
I need you to come here
in case he comes back.

577
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:46,300
- Bobby, I just can't--
- I need your help here!

578
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:49,842
Jesus Christ! Sometimes I think I
love Junior more than you do!

579
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:03,509
<i>We may know that there
are five essentials for victory.</i>

580
00:30:03,592 --> 00:30:07,592
<i>One, he will win
who knows when to fight</i>

581
00:30:07,675 --> 00:30:09,300
<i>and when not to fight.</i>

582
00:30:09,383 --> 00:30:12,634
<i>Two, he will win
who knows how to...</i>

583
00:30:24,467 --> 00:30:26,342
You Gary?

584
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,634
I'm Jimmy. Gary's up there.

585
00:30:29,417 --> 00:30:31,592
Hey! Come down here!

586
00:30:31,675 --> 00:30:32,884
What?

587
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:35,800
I said get down here!
I wanna talk to you.

588
00:30:38,383 --> 00:30:39,550
What do you want?

589
00:30:39,634 --> 00:30:43,218
I'm a friend of Sal Vitro's.
My aunt lives on this street.

590
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,651
So?

591
00:30:44,734 --> 00:30:47,218
So I'm guessin' Sal Vitro
used to do this yard.

592
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,884
- A lotta things used to be.
- Maybe so.

593
00:30:49,967 --> 00:30:52,425
But you're gonna make good
on his busted arm.

594
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:54,300
Oh yeah? Why am I gonna do that?

595
00:30:54,383 --> 00:30:57,759
- 'Cause I said so, that's why.
- Eat shit, pal.

596
00:30:57,842 --> 00:31:00,259
Why don't you take a walk, huh?

597
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:12,842
Unh!

598
00:31:13,884 --> 00:31:15,592
Aaah!

599
00:31:15,675 --> 00:31:17,134
Ohh!

600
00:31:19,634 --> 00:31:22,009
Gimme your wallet, you prick.

601
00:31:30,176 --> 00:31:32,509
This and the mower's
a down payment.

602
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:37,092
By next Tuesday I want Sal
Vitro's whole orthopedist bill paid.

603
00:31:37,176 --> 00:31:39,092
Let's call it 1,200.

604
00:31:39,176 --> 00:31:42,717
Top of that, from now on I get 10% of
whatever you make in this neighborhood.

605
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,967
You motherfucker!

606
00:31:44,051 --> 00:31:45,634
Shut up, I'll give ya a crack.

607
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:15,580
Time is it?

608
00:32:15,604 --> 00:32:18,092
Don't worry, we'll
take the tunnel.

609
00:32:18,676 --> 00:32:19,934
All right, this meetin' today.

610
00:32:20,018 --> 00:32:22,508
We're tryin' to nail down a new
contractor, now with Massarone gone.

611
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:25,550
That office park by Troy Hills?

612
00:32:25,634 --> 00:32:28,383
And listen--
and this is very important--

613
00:32:28,467 --> 00:32:32,218
if any of this shit between little Carmine
and Johnny comes up, you clam up.

614
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,550
- You got it, Ton'.
- Say nothin',

615
00:32:34,634 --> 00:32:38,634
'cause you say
the wrong thing...

616
00:32:42,383 --> 00:32:44,634
- What?
<i>- Tony, it's me.</i>

617
00:32:44,717 --> 00:32:46,675
Listen, it's your uncle.

618
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:48,218
He's gone.

619
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:52,467
- You mean he's dead?
<i>- No, no, no, no.</i>

620
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,342
We think he might've
wandered off.

621
00:32:54,425 --> 00:32:57,926
You know, I didn't wanna call you, but
it's been a couple hours now.

622
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:00,842
- Fuck him.
- He said he was goin' to see Johnny.

623
00:33:00,926 --> 00:33:02,675
You think he might've
meant your dad?

624
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:05,092
- What?
- He's wanderin', Ton'.

625
00:33:05,176 --> 00:33:06,841
He can wander off
the Palisades for all I care.

626
00:33:06,842 --> 00:33:08,300
He's fuckin' dead to me.

627
00:33:29,884 --> 00:33:31,550
I called you almost an hour ago.

628
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,092
Where the hell have you been?

629
00:33:33,976 --> 00:33:36,259
Hello? I was picking
up your daughter?

630
00:33:36,342 --> 00:33:38,092
Stay here, I'm goin' out.

631
00:33:38,176 --> 00:33:39,709
Where the hell is Tommy?

632
00:33:40,092 --> 00:33:42,134
- I sent him home.
- Oh, wonderful.

633
00:33:42,218 --> 00:33:44,592
He gets the day off
and I get to wait by the phone.

634
00:33:44,675 --> 00:33:47,675
It's because of him
Junior escaped, Janice.

635
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,842
- Dad, can I go with you?
- No.

636
00:33:49,926 --> 00:33:51,326
Can Janice go
and we just stay here?

637
00:33:51,383 --> 00:33:53,051
What'd I tell you
about bein' impolite?

638
00:33:53,134 --> 00:33:56,675
If anyone cares,
I'll be upstairs lying down.

639
00:34:01,092 --> 00:34:04,009
One hour of television, then
you both finish your homework.

640
00:34:04,092 --> 00:34:06,476
And you, lay off the Snapple.

641
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:14,526
What galls me is that before
Little Carmine went to Florida,

642
00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:16,118
I was actually close with him.

643
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,134
I was in his wedding party,
for chrissake.

644
00:34:18,218 --> 00:34:20,550
Organized his whole
fuckin' bachelor party.

645
00:34:20,634 --> 00:34:23,550
Lesbian show, whores--
fuckin' disgusting.

646
00:34:23,634 --> 00:34:25,149
Then when they had that kid
with the lung problem,

647
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,066
who you think got him that
doctor on Park Avenue?

648
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:29,092
Water over the dam, huh?

649
00:34:29,176 --> 00:34:31,467
I had no idea you guys
were that close.

650
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,592
Close. We were like brothers.

651
00:34:33,675 --> 00:34:37,509
It's a shame that you can't
find a way to work things out.

652
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:40,051
Gimme me piece of bread, huh?

653
00:34:40,134 --> 00:34:41,926
Have you thought about this?

654
00:34:42,009 --> 00:34:43,759
Maybe you let him keep Lorraine,

655
00:34:43,842 --> 00:34:46,592
and you take a bigger piece
of his Florida shit, the clubs.

656
00:34:46,675 --> 00:34:48,967
If I wanted to worry
about Florida,

657
00:34:49,051 --> 00:34:50,842
I would move to fuckin' Miami.

658
00:34:50,926 --> 00:34:54,009
You know, it wasn't long ago I
remember you used to wait in the car.

659
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,383
And as far as I'm concerned
you should still be there!

660
00:34:57,467 --> 00:35:00,383
- John. He was just tryin'--
- Fuck he was "just"!

661
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:02,675
Everybody's got
a goddamned opinion?

662
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,667
I didn't say nothin', Ton'.

663
00:35:14,092 --> 00:35:15,592
What the fuck did I say?!

664
00:35:15,675 --> 00:35:17,463
- I'm sorry, T., I just thought--
- Now I gotta

665
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:19,425
un-fuck what you just fucked up.

666
00:35:19,509 --> 00:35:21,342
Gotta do somethin' nice
for Johnny. Like what?

667
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:23,717
What the fuck
am I supposed to do?!

668
00:35:31,759 --> 00:35:35,176
You gotta understand, this shit
between Johnny and Little Carmine is bad.

669
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:40,176
The instability. But worse comes to
worse, it could work to our advantage.

670
00:35:40,259 --> 00:35:42,176
How?

671
00:35:42,259 --> 00:35:44,842
They fight, we pick up
any crumbs from the fallout.

672
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,926
The odds are that Johnny'll
end up on top, but who knows.

673
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:55,634
So keep your ears open
and your mouth shut!

674
00:35:57,342 --> 00:36:01,300
Apparently there's a new
president at the electrician's union.

675
00:36:01,383 --> 00:36:04,259
Tony sent Chrissy
over there to talk to him.

676
00:36:04,842 --> 00:36:07,425
Something I've always been
meaning to get straight.

677
00:36:07,509 --> 00:36:09,759
Tony calls Christopher
his nephew,

678
00:36:09,842 --> 00:36:13,727
yet sometimes
you refer to them...

679
00:36:13,751 --> 00:36:14,884
as cousins.

680
00:36:14,967 --> 00:36:17,634
Yeah, right. See,
Chrissy's not Tony's nephew.

681
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,592
Chrissy's Carmela's cousin.

682
00:36:19,675 --> 00:36:23,550
She was first cousin to Dickie
Moltisanti-- Chrissy's dad?

683
00:36:23,634 --> 00:36:28,009
But he was always kinda like
a big brother to Tony, Dickie.

684
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,175
So Tony calls
Chrissy his nephew.

685
00:36:32,759 --> 00:36:35,509
- It's an Italian thing.
- Okay.

686
00:36:35,592 --> 00:36:38,218
Although technically
Tony and Chrissy are cousins.

687
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,592
Joanne Blundetto, Chrissy's mom,

688
00:36:40,675 --> 00:36:43,967
is Tony's cousin
on his mother's side?

689
00:36:44,051 --> 00:36:46,550
But, like, way back.

690
00:36:46,634 --> 00:36:49,176
Like, from the old country
or somethin'.

691
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,218
Robyn?

692
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,884
What?

693
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:59,425
How much longer am I gonna
have to keep doin' this?

694
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:01,842
Major RICO against Tony Soprano?

695
00:37:01,926 --> 00:37:03,884
Those things
take years to build.

696
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:06,383
This recent case against
Joe Macino in New York?

697
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:09,059
It was seven years before
indictments were handed down.

698
00:37:28,134 --> 00:37:29,851
Hello, handsome.

699
00:37:31,342 --> 00:37:34,176
Where you livin' now?
'Round here?

700
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,051
- Do you know me?
- Do I know you?

701
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:45,509
Jupiter Club, on Sixth Street?

702
00:37:46,884 --> 00:37:50,176
Caught fire, that place.

703
00:37:50,259 --> 00:37:52,259
Lotta people died.

704
00:37:52,342 --> 00:37:54,842
Do you know my brother Johnny?

705
00:37:54,926 --> 00:37:56,675
Hmm.

706
00:37:56,759 --> 00:37:59,259
You got all the looks,
I'll tell ya that.

707
00:37:59,342 --> 00:38:02,926
What are you sayin'?
You and I had relations?

708
00:38:09,134 --> 00:38:13,842
Sumbitch taxicab
run me right over my foot.

709
00:38:17,259 --> 00:38:20,176
- I have a car.
- Want a date?

710
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:22,967
I'll give ya half-and-half
in the backseat.

711
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:24,592
I wanna go home.

712
00:38:24,675 --> 00:38:26,342
Well, lemme get a ride
by the shelter.

713
00:38:26,425 --> 00:38:28,092
I have to find my car.

714
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:44,592
How ya doin'?

715
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:47,967
I don't gotta tell you shit.

716
00:39:48,651 --> 00:39:50,467
See some I.D., sir?

717
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,634
Fuck you, copper, I
know my rights.

718
00:39:52,717 --> 00:39:54,592
Hey, take it easy now.

719
00:39:54,675 --> 00:39:57,259
My car was stolen, I
want my lawyer.

720
00:39:57,342 --> 00:39:58,675
What's his name?

721
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,509
Mel.

722
00:40:01,592 --> 00:40:04,134
Okay. Mel what?

723
00:40:04,218 --> 00:40:08,134
See you went out and forgot
your shoes. Where do you live?

724
00:40:08,218 --> 00:40:10,759
- Belleville.
- Sure you don't want to tell me your name?

725
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,383
You're not in any
trouble or anything.

726
00:40:12,467 --> 00:40:14,009
Corrado Soprano.

727
00:40:17,842 --> 00:40:20,383
Tell you what, sir.
Why don't you come and get in the car

728
00:40:20,467 --> 00:40:23,051
where it's nice and warm,
we'll try to figure out

729
00:40:23,134 --> 00:40:25,467
how to get in touch
with your lawyer, all right?

730
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:51,134
Oh, Jesus, Uncle Jun',
thank God!

731
00:40:51,218 --> 00:40:53,759
This gentleman
reside here, ma'am?

732
00:40:53,842 --> 00:40:55,425
He's my uncle.

733
00:40:55,509 --> 00:40:58,009
Where have you been?
We were worried sick.

734
00:40:58,092 --> 00:41:00,425
I'll need to see some
identification, ma'am.

735
00:41:00,509 --> 00:41:02,134
Oh, okay, I'll get my bag.

736
00:41:02,218 --> 00:41:04,176
His, actually.

737
00:41:04,259 --> 00:41:05,675
Bobby, get Uncle Jun's wallet.

738
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:07,634
It's upstairs on his dresser.

739
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,300
Uncle Jun', you're freezing.

740
00:41:15,383 --> 00:41:17,591
We found him walking across
the Clay Street Bridge in Newark.

741
00:41:17,592 --> 00:41:20,717
Newark? Where's your car?

742
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,550
- They stole it.
- Who stoled it?

743
00:41:23,634 --> 00:41:25,009
You know who.

744
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:36,926
It's him.

745
00:41:37,009 --> 00:41:38,383
Junior Soprano.

746
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:42,300
- Here ya go, sir.
- Go shit in your hat.

747
00:41:42,383 --> 00:41:43,842
Uncle Jun', stop!

748
00:41:43,926 --> 00:41:46,759
Thank you, officers. Thank you.

749
00:41:49,509 --> 00:41:52,425
Uncle Jun', did you tell Tommy
you were goin' to see my father?

750
00:41:54,134 --> 00:41:56,092
Of course not.

751
00:41:57,383 --> 00:41:59,218
What are you doing?! Sit!

752
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,634
I have to use the facilities.

753
00:42:00,717 --> 00:42:01,842
Bobby, go with him.

754
00:42:01,926 --> 00:42:03,800
Goddamn it,
I can piss by myself!

755
00:42:03,884 --> 00:42:06,259
Okay. Okay.

756
00:42:08,884 --> 00:42:10,051
I'll open some soup.

757
00:42:10,134 --> 00:42:11,634
You go out for some exercise,

758
00:42:11,717 --> 00:42:14,218
people give ya
the goddamn third degree!

759
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:20,009
<i>- Hi, Ellie.
- Hello, Louie.</i>

760
00:42:20,092 --> 00:42:21,842
<i>How's the big slot machine king?</i>

761
00:42:21,926 --> 00:42:24,092
<i>Oh, I ain't doin' that
no more, I'm retired.</i>

762
00:42:25,592 --> 00:42:28,009
Tony, it's me.

763
00:42:36,342 --> 00:42:37,550
What's the matter?

764
00:42:37,634 --> 00:42:39,425
It's Uncle Jun'.

765
00:42:39,509 --> 00:42:43,234
They found him in Newark...
in his slippers.

766
00:42:43,717 --> 00:42:45,550
He was looking for Daddy, Tony.

767
00:42:45,634 --> 00:42:48,342
He may have Alzheimer's.
I don't know.

768
00:42:48,425 --> 00:42:50,342
Good, maybe he'll forget
my phone number.

769
00:42:50,425 --> 00:42:51,926
Jesus Christ.

770
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,300
<i>Moozadell en carrozza.</i>

771
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,967
- Still warm.
- Artie?

772
00:42:58,051 --> 00:42:59,466
We're in the middle of
a family meeting.

773
00:42:59,467 --> 00:43:00,967
I'm not even here.

774
00:43:02,967 --> 00:43:06,675
He's our uncle, Tony. There may be
something seriously wrong with him.

775
00:43:06,759 --> 00:43:09,516
Listen, Janice, like I
told your husband.

776
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,259
He's fuckin' dead to me.

777
00:43:11,342 --> 00:43:12,458
Are you that fragile?

778
00:43:12,482 --> 00:43:14,299
You don't know the half of
it when it comes to us,

779
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,926
and if you're so concerned, take him
to the fuckin' doctor. 'Cause I've had it.

780
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:20,300
You're the only one he
relates to, Tony.

781
00:43:20,383 --> 00:43:22,342
We won't even be able
to get him in the car.

782
00:43:22,425 --> 00:43:25,300
Fuck him. You reap what you sow.

783
00:43:25,383 --> 00:43:27,051
You sure did.

784
00:43:27,134 --> 00:43:29,009
You think maybe there's a reason

785
00:43:29,092 --> 00:43:31,425
you're living all alone here, Tony,
without your family?

786
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:34,218
Oh-ho. Wait a
minute, wait a minute.

787
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,059
You're gonna give me
advice on marriage?

788
00:43:37,142 --> 00:43:40,592
You know Tony, there's a lot I can
say right now that I am not gonna say.

789
00:43:40,675 --> 00:43:43,342
Fuck it! Say it, say it!
Who gives a fuck?

790
00:43:43,425 --> 00:43:45,675
Think I don't know what
you're doin' here, Janice, huh?

791
00:43:45,759 --> 00:43:47,675
Tryin' to pawn
this shit off on me?

792
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:50,342
Your whole fuckin' life,
whenever there's a family problem

793
00:43:50,425 --> 00:43:52,175
you either shirk your duties
or you run the fuck away!

794
00:43:52,176 --> 00:43:54,509
- Ran away?
- Tibet or fuckin' Berkley...

795
00:43:54,592 --> 00:43:55,892
I was 18 years old!

796
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:57,801
And I was 16 when
you left me in that house

797
00:43:57,825 --> 00:43:59,258
with our head-case of a mother,

798
00:43:59,259 --> 00:44:01,300
who you all of a sudden relate
to so fuckin' well!

799
00:44:01,383 --> 00:44:04,134
- I was merely saying I understand--
- Free-spirit Janice,

800
00:44:04,218 --> 00:44:05,675
rebel without a cause.

801
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,592
While I sit here
mired in her bullshit,

802
00:44:07,675 --> 00:44:10,009
tryin' to be a good son
while you're off droppin' acid

803
00:44:10,092 --> 00:44:12,300
- and blowin' roadies!
- Roadies?

804
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:13,509
Oh, you don't wanna know.

805
00:44:13,592 --> 00:44:15,342
That--That is not true, Tony.

806
00:44:15,425 --> 00:44:18,134
Now you--you tell him that
that's not true!

807
00:44:18,218 --> 00:44:20,467
Poor fuckin' Janice,
she's so fuckin' depressed.

808
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:22,341
Poor fuckin' Janice,
she can't get up off the couch

809
00:44:22,342 --> 00:44:24,382
'cause she's so fuckin'
tired from her Epstein-Barr.

810
00:44:24,383 --> 00:44:26,300
Poor fuckin' Janice--
<i>va fongool.</i>

811
00:44:26,383 --> 00:44:27,989
- Why don't we just calm down?
- Know, what,

812
00:44:28,013 --> 00:44:29,092
maybe you were the smart one

813
00:44:29,176 --> 00:44:30,759
'cause you got
outta here for a while.

814
00:44:30,842 --> 00:44:33,051
But your hippie string ran out,
and now you're back,

815
00:44:33,134 --> 00:44:35,299
and you're gonna do to this man
what you do to every one of 'em.

816
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,259
- Fuckin' piece of shit!
- Ah, you stupid cunt.

817
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,342
- Agghhh!
- Just like your mother, huh?

818
00:44:40,425 --> 00:44:42,342
Now you can do to him
what she did to Daddy!

819
00:44:42,425 --> 00:44:44,176
Enough!

820
00:44:44,259 --> 00:44:46,218
Cocksucker!

821
00:44:53,134 --> 00:44:54,675
You want more responsibility?

822
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:56,926
Start with
controllin' your wife.

823
00:45:08,967 --> 00:45:10,425
And then from nowhere,

824
00:45:10,509 --> 00:45:12,269
he cracks the one kid's head
with the shovel,

825
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,092
then the other one
he knocks out of a tree.

826
00:45:14,176 --> 00:45:16,926
He jumped out the tree,
and come at me with a chainsaw.

827
00:45:17,009 --> 00:45:18,759
I got a right
to defend myself, Ton'.

828
00:45:18,842 --> 00:45:21,509
All right, take it easy. Relax.

829
00:45:21,592 --> 00:45:23,092
Sal Vitro's been
workin' the area

830
00:45:23,176 --> 00:45:25,176
since my ma was still
workin' at Kresge's.

831
00:45:25,259 --> 00:45:28,051
I should be able to help out
a kid from my own neighborhood.

832
00:45:29,884 --> 00:45:33,009
All right, how about this. Vitro
and your nephew split the area.

833
00:45:33,092 --> 00:45:35,218
East of Dyer is yours.

834
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,592
West of Dyer goes to him.

835
00:45:36,675 --> 00:45:38,009
As for the broken arm,

836
00:45:38,092 --> 00:45:40,383
I don't know,
give him 500 bucks.

837
00:45:40,467 --> 00:45:42,176
I already told the guy 12, T.

838
00:45:42,259 --> 00:45:45,592
Well there's fuckin'
compromises in life, Paulie.

839
00:45:48,967 --> 00:45:51,759
All right, make it a grand,
for the pain and sufferin'.

840
00:45:51,842 --> 00:45:54,134
Naturally, I want my taste,
retroactive,

841
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:57,092
'cause this is the first time I've
been hearin' about any of this.

842
00:45:57,176 --> 00:46:01,342
It's a new venture. My
nephew's barely on his feet.

843
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,134
I mean, I didn't
wanna start kickin' up,

844
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:05,092
then pull it back
if it don't work out.

845
00:46:07,967 --> 00:46:10,967
And of course, Vitro'll
do your grass too, Ton'.

846
00:46:11,051 --> 00:46:12,825
No charge.

847
00:46:13,509 --> 00:46:15,592
Remind me to talk
to you about that later.

848
00:46:20,842 --> 00:46:23,009
There he is. Salvatore, my boy,

849
00:46:23,092 --> 00:46:24,425
how's that pitchin' arm?

850
00:46:24,509 --> 00:46:25,675
It's gettin' there.

851
00:46:25,759 --> 00:46:28,717
Paul, say hello
to Mr. Gaultieri.

852
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,717
That's my middle name. Paul.

853
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,051
So I talked to that guy.
Good news.

854
00:46:39,134 --> 00:46:43,134
I gotcha 500 for your arm,
and you keep half your area.

855
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:45,675
- Half?
- It could've been nothin'.

856
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,176
Lucky you know me.

857
00:46:47,259 --> 00:46:49,717
West of Dyer's yours,
east belongs to him.

858
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,259
Paulie, my wife's gonna sh--

859
00:46:54,259 --> 00:46:55,675
All right, thank you, Paulie.

860
00:46:57,675 --> 00:46:59,300
Oh, one more thing.

861
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:02,926
You're gonna have to cut
a couple of lawns on the comp.

862
00:47:03,009 --> 00:47:04,634
Some friends of ours.

863
00:47:17,218 --> 00:47:19,051
Some shot, huh,
the way it hooked?

864
00:47:19,134 --> 00:47:20,854
Ya got a fuckin'
horseshoe up your ass, you.

865
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:23,550
Mr. Soprano!

866
00:47:27,759 --> 00:47:30,176
Harry Winer. I was your
mother's neurologist.

867
00:47:30,259 --> 00:47:31,717
I did her work-up
from Green Grove?

868
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,550
Ah, yeah, how ya doin'?

869
00:47:33,634 --> 00:47:36,634
So I assume your sister told you
I'm treating your uncle.

870
00:47:37,884 --> 00:47:39,675
Oh yeah, yeah, she mentioned it.

871
00:47:39,759 --> 00:47:41,942
- Catch you in there, T.
- Yeah.

872
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:45,759
I think with the right meds we 
can control these things.

873
00:47:45,842 --> 00:47:47,342
What things?

874
00:47:47,425 --> 00:47:48,717
The infarcts.

875
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,675
They're akin to mini-strokes?

876
00:47:50,759 --> 00:47:52,758
He suffered some significant
brain trauma the other day.

877
00:47:52,759 --> 00:47:53,958
You probably noticed him
acting differently

878
00:47:53,959 --> 00:47:55,842
over the past six months,
a year, maybe?

879
00:47:55,926 --> 00:47:57,609
Oh, well to tell ya
the truth, me and my uncle,

880
00:47:57,692 --> 00:47:59,383
we don't talk much anymore.

881
00:47:59,467 --> 00:48:01,800
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that, uh...

882
00:48:01,884 --> 00:48:03,884
Don't be. He's a hostile prick.

883
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:06,847
Well, unfortunately obstinacy is
consistent with his condition.

884
00:48:07,309 --> 00:48:08,926
Impatience, forgetfulness,

885
00:48:09,009 --> 00:48:10,759
particularly with
short-term memory.

886
00:48:10,842 --> 00:48:12,984
Do you find he'll ask the same
question every three minutes?

887
00:48:13,067 --> 00:48:15,192
What time it is...?

888
00:48:16,176 --> 00:48:19,383
I don't know. Maybe. Yeah.

889
00:48:19,467 --> 00:48:22,258
Well it's frustrating, I know, but anyway,
the last thing I wanted to do was

890
00:48:22,259 --> 00:48:24,176
get in the middle
of a family squabble.

891
00:48:24,259 --> 00:48:25,800
I just wanted to say hello.

892
00:48:25,884 --> 00:48:29,176
- Well, nice seein' ya.
- Okay. All right.

893
00:49:04,759 --> 00:49:06,299
<i>Members of the squirrel family,</i>

894
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,884
<i>the prairie dog
makes it home mainly...</i>

895
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:11,534
Tommy?

896
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,009
Brought you some fish.

897
00:49:17,092 --> 00:49:18,800
Tryin' to clean out
my refrigerator.

898
00:49:18,884 --> 00:49:21,967
Make sure you form a seal
when you shut that freezer door.

899
00:49:27,592 --> 00:49:29,550
<i>Of the two main species,</i>

900
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:33,550
<i>the black-tailed prairie dog
is much more widespread,</i>

901
00:49:33,634 --> 00:49:37,342
<i>inhabiting much of the Great
Plains and the Great Basin.</i>

902
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,634
So how you feelin'?

903
00:49:52,717 --> 00:49:55,218
Heard you had a little problem.

904
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,425
What problem?

905
00:49:59,134 --> 00:50:01,467
All right...

906
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:04,842
but your doctor
said somethin' different.

907
00:50:04,926 --> 00:50:07,800
Who, Kennedy?

908
00:50:07,884 --> 00:50:10,383
Kennedy's your cancer doctor.

909
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:12,467
I knew that.

910
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:14,634
You said doctor.

911
00:50:15,884 --> 00:50:17,218
<i>The white-tailed prairie dog</i>

912
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,467
<i>lives at higher elevations,</i>

913
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:21,842
<i>hibernating
throughout the winter.</i>

914
00:50:21,926 --> 00:50:25,300
Just take your medicine,
Uncle Jun'.

915
00:50:25,383 --> 00:50:27,781
Make ya feel better.

916
00:50:28,605 --> 00:50:30,459
Help with your memory.

917
00:50:32,509 --> 00:50:35,383
Believe me, there's plenty
I'd like to forget.

918
00:50:35,467 --> 00:50:37,992
Yeah, you and me both.

919
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:47,759
Feech was here?

920
00:50:47,842 --> 00:50:50,467
What? Yeah, he came
to pay his respects.

921
00:50:52,592 --> 00:50:56,092
So what's this I hear,
you ruled against Feech?

922
00:50:56,176 --> 00:50:57,759
He's an important man.

923
00:50:57,842 --> 00:50:59,217
Why is he bitchin' at
you about shit?

924
00:50:59,218 --> 00:51:01,342
I'm still the boss
of this family.

925
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:02,884
Despite any arrangements.

926
00:51:09,009 --> 00:51:11,675
<i>Yellow in color,
they often have dark...</i>

927
00:51:11,759 --> 00:51:14,634
These prairie dogs,
they'll sleep during the day.

928
00:51:14,717 --> 00:51:16,342
Oh, yeah?

929
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:23,842
Look, the doctor said you...

930
00:51:23,926 --> 00:51:26,259
may not have known
what you were sayin'.

931
00:51:26,342 --> 00:51:28,425
What are you talkin' about?

932
00:51:28,509 --> 00:51:31,051
The varsity shit.

933
00:51:42,967 --> 00:51:45,683
So what else did Feech
have to say?

934
00:51:46,467 --> 00:51:48,884
Gettin' a new top
on his convertible.

935
00:51:51,717 --> 00:51:56,259
All right, let's assume that you didn't
know what you were sayin', that...

936
00:51:56,342 --> 00:51:59,176
that you forget when
you say shit over and over.

937
00:51:59,259 --> 00:52:01,226
Yeah?

938
00:52:02,009 --> 00:52:04,550
Why's it gotta
be somethin' mean?

939
00:52:04,634 --> 00:52:07,759
Why can't you repeat
something good?

940
00:52:14,176 --> 00:52:16,842
There's the coyote.

941
00:52:22,092 --> 00:52:24,842
I mean, don't you love me?
