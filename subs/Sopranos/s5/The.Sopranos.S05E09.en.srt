00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,917

00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:53,500

37
00:01:53,584 --> 00:01:55,584
Want another super nacho?

38
00:01:57,168 --> 00:01:59,834
No, they been sitting too long.
The cheese is all sweaty.

39
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:02,168
This guy in the joint,
crazy Rasta fuck,

40
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,709
used to make grilled cheese
on the radiator.

41
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:08,292
He'd put the bread between
two sheets of paper.

42
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,984
Had a whole system.

43
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:11,959
What'd you do to your foot?

44
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:14,168
The other night
in fucking Irvington,

45
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,792
two black guys jumped me
outside a bar.

46
00:02:16,876 --> 00:02:18,791
With half of them locked
up making grilled cheese,

47
00:02:18,792 --> 00:02:21,550
you'd think there wouldn't be
so many around to make trouble.

48
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:23,375
Should I melt another batch?

49
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:24,792
Nah. I'm good.

50
00:02:24,876 --> 00:02:26,250
I got dinner in the city.

51
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:35,472
So, Finn, you got any plans
for the summer?

52
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,168
Going back to Mission Viejo
to surf, or whatever?

53
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,041
Actually, I'm hoping
to stay here in the city.

54
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:43,625
- How's summer school going?
- It sucks.

55
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:45,917
I did summer school once.
You can still have fun.

56
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:49,459
Casa Carmela? He's looking
at maximum security summer.

57
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:53,168
Excuse me a minute.

58
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,042
Why don't you cut
your mother a break?

59
00:02:56,126 --> 00:02:58,625
For the record, she's the one
holding this family together

60
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:01,709
during this current
situation and all.

61
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:06,792
- Can we get the check, please?
- The young man took care of it.

62
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:16,792
You paid the check?

63
00:03:16,876 --> 00:03:19,459
I figured since you're always
so, you know, generous,

64
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:21,042
I should reciprocate.

65
00:03:21,126 --> 00:03:23,625
You're lucky you don't get
your head handed to you.

66
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:26,168
- Dad.
- Let's get something straight.

67
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,333
- You eat, I pay.
- Mr. Soprano...

68
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,168
No, when you have
your own family, you pay.

69
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:40,667
Let's go.

70
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,584
Just take the money.

71
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:01,958
All right, listen, I didn't mean
to bite your head off in there.

72
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:03,559
No, it's fine.
I didn't mean to overstep.

73
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,459
I just wanted to say thank you.

74
00:04:06,142 --> 00:04:07,292
You're a good guy.

75
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,333
I respect you trying.

76
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,250
And then he fell asleep
right after.

77
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:21,333
He did call me late
the next morning.

78
00:04:21,417 --> 00:04:22,959
And he sent flowers.

79
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:25,459
But other than that, I haven't

80
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:27,250
heard from him all week.

81
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,133
- What'd he say?
- That it was nice, you know.

82
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,500
And it was nice.
He was very sweet, actually.

83
00:04:31,584 --> 00:04:34,209
So, you think what happened
at the party is an overture

84
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:36,209
Tony wants to get back together?

85
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:37,542
I don't know. Maybe.

86
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:40,876
He's dropping A.J. off later.

87
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:44,458
This is the last thing
I need to get into right now.

88
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:46,959
Oh, please,
he never had it so good.

89
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:49,250
Oh, that's him.

90
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,250
You two should talk.

91
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,001
Let me just pee.

92
00:05:16,126 --> 00:05:18,542
So, was your father
in a rush now or something?

93
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,500
No. Said he was tired.

94
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:24,750
To give you this
and a kiss on the cheek.

95
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:30,459
Thank God.

96
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:33,084
That's the last thing
I needed, was to talk to him.

97
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,500
You know who loved golf?

98
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,667
Was Joey Peeps.

99
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,959
May he rest in peace.

100
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:53,292
Yeah, it's sad when
they go young like that.

101
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,709
When they go?

102
00:05:56,084 --> 00:05:57,834
Come on, huh?

103
00:05:57,917 --> 00:05:59,959
It was Little Carmine behind it.

104
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:01,522
Payback for that whore
he was fucking,

105
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:02,792
Lorraine Calluzzo.

106
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:04,917
You don't know that
for sure, John.

107
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:09,625
Little Carmine knew how fond
I was of this kid, Tony.

108
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:11,459
I picked him out of the chorus.

109
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:14,001
Schooled him those years
he was my driver.

110
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,250
Anything from your cop?

111
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,625
Some homeless fuck
saw a guy limping away.

112
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:22,750
And then he wasn't sure.

113
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,234
I'll tell you,

114
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:46,001
I don't know how I'm gonna
get through Joey's funeral.

115
00:06:46,084 --> 00:06:48,001
And forget about Ginny.

116
00:06:48,084 --> 00:06:50,542
Every Christmas, Joey'd send her a

117
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,959
Grandma's of Maine
coffee cake.

118
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,209
Whoa! What's wrong?
You all right?

119
00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:57,001
Is it his heart? No.

120
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,042
It's this fucking weather.
Sudden changes.

121
00:06:59,126 --> 00:07:01,584
Fucks up your
respiratory system.

122
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:03,001
Come on. I got you.

123
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:05,084
Get some electrolytes in him.

124
00:07:05,168 --> 00:07:08,126
We got you. Come on. That's it.

125
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:09,917
Sit down. Good, good.

126
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:11,876
That's it. That's it.

127
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,625
You're all right.
You're all right.

128
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,417
The point I am trying
to illustrate is that

129
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,584
of course no one wants
all-out conflict.

130
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,375
But historically,

131
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:25,459
historical changes
have come out of war.

132
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:28,375
Far as I'm concerned,
it's a new day.

133
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:30,584
All old treaties
and ways of doing things

134
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:31,959
are null and void.

135
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:33,126
Exactly.

136
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:34,709
And the Joe Peeps thing?

137
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:36,250
Where does that leave us?

138
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,375
When you've had
a quadruple bypass like I did,

139
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,209
it gives you a lot
of time to think.

140
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:45,459
The only thing Johnny
understands is force.

141
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:48,417
But the fact is, though,
we pissed on a bees' nest.

142
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
So, what's the other option?

143
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:51,876
Roll over?

144
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:57,417
We could've had a sit-down.

145
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,542
The other captains, maybe.

146
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,126
This isn't the UN, Angelo.

147
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:03,709
I won't let what happened
to my father happen to me.

148
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:05,042
God forgive me,

149
00:08:05,126 --> 00:08:07,917
but you may be a stronger man
than your dad was.

150
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:10,250
The fundamental question is,

151
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,250
will I be as effective
as a boss like my dad was?

152
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,084
And I will be.

153
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:18,333
Even more so, but until I am,
it's gonna be hard to verify

154
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:20,709
that I think I'll be
more effective.

155
00:08:21,784 --> 00:08:23,734
I just talked to my parents.

156
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:25,397
They offered me
a JetBlue ticket home.

157
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:26,709
No economic relief.

158
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:28,584
What did the lady at student
placement say?

159
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:30,333
I never went down there.

160
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:31,584
Why didn't you?

161
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:33,084
This economy? Hello?

162
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:35,667
I mean, even the crappiest
McJobs aren't there.

163
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,249
Besides, I wouldn't want
to take away a job

164
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,834
a minority could have.

165
00:08:41,876 --> 00:08:43,584
Just... It doesn't cool
anything anyway.

166
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:45,750
Leave it.

167
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:47,959
Don't open the window.
The garbage reeks.

168
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:50,250
Why do we want to be
in New York anyway?

169
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,917
It was supposed to be fun,
remember?

170
00:08:52,001 --> 00:08:54,209
Summer before the big push
of grad school?

171
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:57,001
You could go out to Jersey,
sleep in comfort.

172
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:00,333
Is that what you want?

173
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:01,625
No.

174
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,168
All I know is, I cannot go home

175
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:05,917
and live with my parents.

176
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:09,542
I graduated.

177
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,876
I mean, maybe I should
go back out.

178
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:20,625
I can work as a PA
for Josh's dad.

179
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:23,375
At least I'd earn some cash.
You could come out for a week.

180
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,126
Wait, wait, wait. What?

181
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:26,458
He's a photographer. I told you.

182
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,084
He does major magazine ads.

183
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:30,542
BMW. It's pretty cool stuff.

184
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,333
- Is that what you want?
- No.

185
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:35,876
But at least I'd have money.

186
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,750
Your thing with models.

187
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:39,542
- There's no models.
- What?

188
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,042
It's interesting work.

189
00:09:42,126 --> 00:09:44,834
As a career, actually, I mean...

190
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,126
Josh's dad saw my shots that won
the prize in high school.

191
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:50,584
Said they were
"solidly unsentimental."

192
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,584
What are you talking about?

193
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:54,792
Just blow off dental school?

194
00:09:54,876 --> 00:09:57,500
You haven't taken
one photograph in a year.

195
00:09:57,584 --> 00:09:59,417
You bitch every time
we're at a party

196
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,959
I ask you to take a snap
of me and my friends.

197
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:03,209
Look, I'm just saying...

198
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:04,459
I gave up junior year abroad

199
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:06,001
- so we could be together.
- I know.

200
00:10:06,084 --> 00:10:07,333
And I wanna stay here.

201
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,209
I could come out west with you.

202
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:13,375
But I have to blow off
the law center.

203
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:15,375
- Is that what you want to do?
- I don't know.

204
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:17,209
Do you want me to come out?

205
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:18,459
If you want to.

206
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:20,042
No, you need to say.

207
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:22,959
Maybe we should stay out there.

208
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:25,417
You could transfer to UCLA.

209
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:29,459
Fuck it.

210
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:32,459
It's roasting in here.

211
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:35,126
It's 10:30.
We can still get into a movie.

212
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:39,459
What do you want to see?

213
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:41,375
I don't know. You say.

214
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:43,542
No, you.

215
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,500
Hello?

216
00:10:52,584 --> 00:10:54,750
Mrs. Soprano.
Lee Nieman returning.

217
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:56,667
<i>Oh, hi, great, thank you.</i>

218
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,792
The reason I called, I gave your
secretary the broad strokes.

219
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:01,417
You're in the middle
of a separation,

220
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,750
your original attorney retired.

221
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:04,459
<i>Right. Bob Greenberg.</i>

222
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:07,168
At any rate, I'm thinking
it's time I move forward

223
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,292
with the divorce proceedings. Uh...

224
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,667
Mrs. Soprano, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to cut you short.

225
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,001
As far as handling it,

226
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:15,042
I'm afraid I have to
recuse myself.

227
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:16,333
What do you mean? Why?

228
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,376
<i>Actually, your husband</i>

229
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,250
had been in to see me
for a consultation last year.

230
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,500
- My husband hired you?
<i>- No.</i>

231
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:26,959
But based on a prior meeting,

232
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:28,750
the code of professional
responsibility

233
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:30,375
precludes me
from representing you

234
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:32,126
<i>because of that consultation.</i>

235
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:33,625
But he met with Greenberg too,

236
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:35,126
and he was willing
to represent me.

237
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:36,749
Well, Mr. Greenberg
would've found himself

238
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,542
in a bit of ethical soup
had he actually moved forward.

239
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,749
See, I don't understand this.
Why is my husband so picky?

240
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,001
He talked to seven or eight
of the top divorce attorneys

241
00:11:44,084 --> 00:11:45,500
in New Jersey.

242
00:11:45,584 --> 00:11:46,709
Well, you can probably

243
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:48,709
figure that maneuver out
for yourself.

244
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,209
Oh, Jesus Christ.

245
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:53,667
I understand your frustration.

246
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,584
If you like, I can
recommend a colleague.

247
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:57,709
<i>Someone your husband
hasn't contaminated.</i>

248
00:11:57,792 --> 00:12:00,242
Well, okay.

249
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:07,792
According to Johnny Sack,

250
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:10,459
the kid's brains
were splattered over the seat.

251
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:11,792
Joe Peeps?

252
00:12:11,876 --> 00:12:13,959
Couldn't have been
too much to clean up.

253
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:18,209
I heard the hooker
he was with got it in the chest.

254
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:21,333
Must have been silicone
everywheres too.

255
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:23,042
Why you always try and top me?

256
00:12:23,126 --> 00:12:26,292
You took the air right out of my
whole fucking punch line, asshole.

257
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,526
Anyway,

258
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:31,817
Joey Peeps' mom's a widow,
she's in a wheelchair.

259
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,292
Johnny's taking care of the interment.
That shit there.

260
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,709
So I'm thinking we should
pick up the headstone.

261
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:40,084
Jason, get into it.

262
00:12:40,168 --> 00:12:42,333
I'll call the marble guy.

263
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:45,333
- What's up, guys?
- Frank.

264
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:46,584
Frankie.

265
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:47,959
Talk to you outside?

266
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:55,834
Give me two.

267
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:09,775
What's up?

268
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:13,009
Turns out somebody got a look
at the guy that did Joe Peeps.

269
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:17,375
All they got so far
is he's got a bad limp.

270
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:19,709
Huh. Long John Silver, maybe.

271
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:22,417
Where the fuck
do you get the balls?

272
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,959
I am bending over backwards
trying to stay neutral,

273
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:28,001
paying for fucking car seats.

274
00:13:28,084 --> 00:13:31,500
And you're out there acting
like a fucking free agent.

275
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:35,542
And don't look at me
like I'm a fucking jerkoff.

276
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,665
Because I'm sick of you
leaning on this cousin thing

277
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,001
and that bad hijack,
like you can

278
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,167
do whatever the fuck it is
you want to do,

279
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:43,709
'cause you went away that
night and I didn't!

280
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:45,375
You're the one
keeps bringing that up.

281
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:46,750
I'm fine with it.

282
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,750
First of all, for the record,
I had nothing to do with this.

283
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:00,386
- Don't fucking lie to me!
- Even if I was,

284
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,533
would you really wanna know?

285
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:05,792
That'd just be another problem
for you with Johnny, right?

286
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:15,084
Look, I know you're not
earning what you expected.

287
00:14:15,168 --> 00:14:17,625
And you got the twins,
and Nancy.

288
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,642
You're a capable guy.

289
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,001
Your mother let it slip
one time.

290
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:25,459
You got an IQ of 158.

291
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:27,374
- She told you that?
- The week you got tested.

292
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,084
All the fucking nuns
were raving about it.

293
00:14:31,126 --> 00:14:32,625
Lot of good it did me.

294
00:14:34,168 --> 00:14:36,168
I had high hopes
when you got out.

295
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,542
Yeah?

296
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,667
Look, a guy like you...
brains, balls...

297
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,876
if you'd fucking
be straight with me,

298
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:43,542
I could use all that.

299
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,500
Put me in, coach.

300
00:14:54,168 --> 00:14:56,292
All right, we got the casino
on Bloomfield Avenue

301
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,042
above the hardware store.

302
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:00,709
Carlo's guy was running it,

303
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:03,168
but he just got diagnosed
with the Hodgkin's.

304
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,959
- That's mine?
- Yeah.

305
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,959
A lot of fucking money there.

306
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,292
And I'll see what I can do

307
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,834
about getting you
straightened out,

308
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:14,750
opening up the books for you.

309
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,667
It's long overdue.

310
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,168
Huh?

311
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:28,584
So I solved a major
problem business-wise.

312
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:31,792
Put a very good piece
of manpower to work.

313
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:33,542
My cousin Tony.

314
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,584
You mentioned how close
you two are.

315
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:38,249
You know, when we were kids, they
used to call me Tony Uncle Johnny,

316
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,667
and they'd call him
Tony Uncle Al.

317
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,042
Right, yes.
You told me all that.

318
00:15:42,126 --> 00:15:45,625
Anyway, he's a very smart guy.
He's got an IQ of 158.

319
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:48,500
Do you put a lot of stock
into that number?

320
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:50,459
Why, are you gonna tell me it's bullshit?

321
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:55,042
'Cause I took that test,
and somebody gets a 158,

322
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:57,417
well, they know a few things.

323
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,584
So we can assume you think
he's smarter than you.

324
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,250
Honestly, I think
he's smarter than you,

325
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,876
the way you keep shitting
on the test.

326
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:07,250
But I'm no <i>gabadotz</i> myself.

327
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,126
This was a good move.

328
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:16,625
Carmela and I slept together.

329
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:19,459
What was that like?

330
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:20,876
It was nice.

331
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,750
It was very...

332
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:25,042
erotic.

333
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,792
She was wearing that perfume
that she wears.

334
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:35,168
Poor thing was starved for it,
honestly.

335
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:40,750
I'm the only man
she's ever been with.

336
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,459
Did you discuss it?

337
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:46,168
Nah, I left before she woke up.

338
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,834
How come?

339
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,126
'Cause if she woke up
and I was there,

340
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:53,333
it would send mixed signals,
you know.

341
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:55,926
I'm not sure that's the best...

342
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,542
Yeah.

343
00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:06,750
No. Tell him I got fax machines
coming out of my ass.

344
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:10,750
And would you characterize
the separation thus far

345
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:12,333
as amicable?

346
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:14,250
It's barely civil.

347
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,959
Yeah, there are moments
when old habits kick in.

348
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:19,126
And, you know, feelings.

349
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:20,569
But he is definitely
not the person

350
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,709
I want to spend the rest
of my life with.

351
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:23,959
Fair enough.

352
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,792
As for the assets.

353
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:28,876
You've given me your tax returns
and investments here?

354
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:31,292
The house is in my name.
Not the boat.

355
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,542
That's the Stugots, is it?

356
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:35,667
Yes.

357
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,270
I'm a little concerned
that the returns

358
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:38,572
don't really reflect everything.

359
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,375
There is other income.
There's a lot more.

360
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,209
Unreported income?

361
00:17:44,292 --> 00:17:45,917
Yes.

362
00:17:46,001 --> 00:17:49,001
And this other income,
is it from an illegal stream?

363
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:51,001
No, of course not.

364
00:17:51,084 --> 00:17:53,375
But he does deal in cash,
my husband.

365
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:55,209
The carting business.

366
00:17:55,292 --> 00:17:56,667
I see.

367
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,126
- Is that a problem?
- I handled a case once

368
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:03,917
where the husband owned
vending machines.

369
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:08,542
I used a forensic accountant
to reconstruct his finances.

370
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,001
In less than a week,

371
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:13,126
he outlined 11 years of income.

372
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,417
And we're talking coins.

373
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,792
Hey, you. Busy day?

374
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:27,250
I dropped off an application
at the Cineplex on Broadway.

375
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,917
Stopped by my dad's.

376
00:18:29,001 --> 00:18:31,667
Looks like he got you a job
working construction.

377
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,168
Construction?

378
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,375
That's awesome.

379
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:35,484
It's in Jersey, though,

380
00:18:35,568 --> 00:18:37,609
so you'll have to take
the PATH train.

381
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:39,459
Fine, no problem.

382
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:43,042
But the most I ever did, though,
is, like, help my dad paint.

383
00:18:43,126 --> 00:18:44,625
He said you don't
need experience.

384
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:46,584
You'll be a laborer
or something.

385
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,500
Pays like 20 bucks an hour.

386
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:50,542
Holy shit.

387
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:53,584
How is that even possible?

388
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:05,625
You believe these fucking
Blue Jays?

389
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:06,959
Last inning, I screamed so loud

390
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:08,959
my wife thought
I was having a heart attack.

391
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:10,375
Why, what happened?

392
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:13,917
Burrell got shelled.
It was beautiful.

393
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:15,876
- What are you, a Met fan?
- Padres, actually.

394
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:18,333
- Padres?
- I'm from California.

395
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:20,126
I gotta go make my collections.

396
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:21,584
Stick with the Angels.

397
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:23,417
The Pads haven't had
a team in 20 years.

398
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,168
What are you talking about?
They were in the Series in '98.

399
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,500
Yanks in four. I was there.

400
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,834
Hey, Shaggy,

401
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:36,250
grab a bucket and some Lysol.

402
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,792
Scrub off my tires.

403
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,417
There's fucking dog shit
all over by the entrance.

404
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,333
I'm supposed to be
picking up scrap.

405
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:45,042
You'll be picking up your teeth
in another second.

406
00:19:45,126 --> 00:19:47,750
Hey, DeTrolio,
you need something to do?

407
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:49,333
Get fucking lost!

408
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:51,126
Come on, guys.

409
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,042
Go!

410
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,709
Before it sets in the treads!

411
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:01,084
Oh, my checks come in yet?

412
00:20:01,168 --> 00:20:03,042
I don't know.
I didn't see the girl.

413
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:05,500
If she ain't got them,
send the kid, Meadow's friend,

414
00:20:05,584 --> 00:20:06,959
when he's done with your car.

415
00:20:07,042 --> 00:20:09,084
Who Meadow?
What are you talking about?

416
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:12,333
Meadow Soprano.
That's her boyfriend.

417
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:16,209
There he is!

418
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:18,917
I can't find any Lysol.

419
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:20,500
Don't worry about it.

420
00:20:20,584 --> 00:20:22,834
Why didn't you tell me
you were dating my niece?

421
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,584
Here.

422
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,500
You take her someplace nice.

423
00:20:29,584 --> 00:20:32,042
Make sure you tell her
it's from Uncle Paulie.

424
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:33,792
Thank you, I...

425
00:20:33,876 --> 00:20:35,042
That's really nice.

426
00:20:35,126 --> 00:20:36,667
Here. Give me that shit.

427
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:39,209
Paulie!

428
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:40,667
Come here.

429
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,209
Get the hose.

430
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:50,292
Sorry I'm late.

431
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,417
You been waitin' long?

432
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,834
Not really.

433
00:20:58,459 --> 00:20:59,500
Yeah.

434
00:20:59,584 --> 00:21:01,792
So to what do I owe
this pleasure?

435
00:21:01,876 --> 00:21:04,333
Well, I don't know
if you're gonna see it that way.

436
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:06,168
I have asked you to lunch

437
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,126
to tell you that I'm filing
for divorce.

438
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:14,084
I hope you brought
your appetite.

439
00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:18,876
Why don't you give us a minute.

440
00:21:23,168 --> 00:21:25,292
Oh, that's nice.

441
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,959
Invite me to a public place

442
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:30,625
so you could ambush me.

443
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,876
What, you think
I won't make a scene?

444
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,834
Spare me your outrage, Tony.

445
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:39,333
Accept the fact that I am
moving on with my life.

446
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:41,126
Moving on?

447
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:43,208
That's what you were doing
after the party last week?

448
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:46,459
I think you and I both know
that didn't change anything.

449
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:48,959
First of all, we're Italian.
We don't believe in divorce.

450
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:51,917
We believe in
the nuclear family.

451
00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:53,584
Will you listen to yourself?

452
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:58,333
And despite your best efforts...

453
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,834
I have an attorney

454
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:03,834
who is going to aggressively
pursue my custody of A.J.,

455
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:06,126
and also an equitable
distribution

456
00:22:06,209 --> 00:22:07,625
of our assets.

457
00:22:07,709 --> 00:22:09,126
Our assets?

458
00:22:09,209 --> 00:22:10,584
I am through trying to get you

459
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:12,834
to provide beyond the minimum
I need to live.

460
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:15,750
Oh, so it's fucking money.
That's all this is to you?

461
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,994
After all we've been through,

462
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:18,834
is it so hard to own up
to anything

463
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:21,333
beyond that bullshit tax return?

464
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:27,792
Go stand over there.
I'll call you when I'm ready.

465
00:22:31,042 --> 00:22:32,500
You want money?

466
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:34,834
How about my 40 grand you stole
out of the bird feeder?

467
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:36,168
That should be plenty,

468
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,834
you're such
an investment genius.

469
00:22:37,917 --> 00:22:39,197
You want this to get ugly, Tony?

470
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,667
Because these guys
live for that.

471
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,625
Oh, you think I don't?

472
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:50,584
The only reason
you have anything

473
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:52,126
is 'cause of my fucking sweat.

474
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:53,529
And you knew every step
of the way

475
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:54,792
exactly how it works.

476
00:22:54,876 --> 00:22:57,126
But you walk around
that fucking mansion

477
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,876
in your $500 shoes
and your diamond rings,

478
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:03,542
and you act like butter
wouldn't melt in your mouth.

479
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,375
And you don't want it
to get ugly?

480
00:23:05,459 --> 00:23:06,542
Too late.

481
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:09,168
I want what I am entitled to.

482
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,834
You're entitled to shit.

483
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:14,417
She's ready to order.

484
00:23:22,084 --> 00:23:24,001
I guess we get along.

485
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:25,959
We're just different, you know.

486
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:27,667
She zigs, I zag.

487
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,959
That kind of thing.

488
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:30,459
What's her dad like?

489
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,001
He's always flirting.

490
00:23:32,084 --> 00:23:33,459
He's okay.

491
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:34,876
A little intense sometimes.

492
00:23:41,126 --> 00:23:43,625
The main thing's
that he's a good person.

493
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:49,084
So, you guys gonna
get married or what?

494
00:23:49,168 --> 00:23:50,750
Living together's
the same thing.

495
00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:53,625
Uh-uh. I lived with a guy once,
and trust me,

496
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:55,625
it's not even close
to being the same thing.

497
00:23:55,709 --> 00:23:57,042
What do you mean? Why?

498
00:23:57,126 --> 00:23:58,542
Because.

499
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:01,876
You could just pack up and leave
whenever the shit hits the fan.

500
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:03,625
Talk to married people.

501
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:06,625
That ring, believe it or not,

502
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:09,792
it's got this kind of,
like, weird power.

503
00:24:09,876 --> 00:24:12,250
So, what happened
with you and this guy?

504
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,417
Phineas, my boy!

505
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,584
Hey.

506
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:17,168
It's actually just Finn.

507
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,042
So, the Cubbies gave your boys
a shellacking last night.

508
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,542
It's still early.

509
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,259
That's true.
You know who he looks like?

510
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:26,417
That guy from Aerosmith,
Joe Perry.

511
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:29,917
- Your boss inside?
- Yeah.

512
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,792
All right.
I'll see youse around.

513
00:24:31,876 --> 00:24:33,126
All right.

514
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:37,667
He seems like a nice guy.

515
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,333
Yeah. They all are, pretty much.

516
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:43,625
So, you dating anybody now?

517
00:24:53,168 --> 00:24:54,584
It's cute.

518
00:24:55,917 --> 00:24:57,759
It's a lot of money
for not much shirt.

519
00:24:57,842 --> 00:24:59,417
Relax, I'll put it
on my own card.

520
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,250
You're damn right you will.

521
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,249
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Ask your father.

522
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,417
He stopped paying my
credit card bills.

523
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,584
Daddy?

524
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:07,834
You guys looked pretty chummy

525
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:09,084
in the pool that night.

526
00:25:09,168 --> 00:25:10,333
He went home with Artie.

527
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:12,009
They helped me clean up.

528
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:21,292
I have decided to move ahead
with the divorce.

529
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:24,042
What are you gonna do?

530
00:25:24,126 --> 00:25:25,750
- About what?
- Life.

531
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:28,001
- I don't know.
- What can I do?

532
00:25:28,084 --> 00:25:31,001
Haven't you ever thought beyond
being dependent on some man?

533
00:25:31,084 --> 00:25:33,017
It's so simple for you, isn't it?

534
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,040
It's simple for everybody who
isn't expecting things

535
00:25:35,184 --> 00:25:37,059
to be handed to them.

536
00:25:37,142 --> 00:25:38,958
Even Finn got a job
working construction.

537
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:40,459
Good for Finn, then.

538
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:42,425
There are options in life.

539
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,534
Isn't that what
you always told me?

540
00:25:44,617 --> 00:25:47,525
You have options.
I have a lawyer.

541
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,625
Oh, Phineas!

542
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:02,209
He was just asking.

543
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:03,834
How come a dentist?

544
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:05,517
What's wrong with being
a regular doctor?

545
00:26:05,542 --> 00:26:09,025
I saw this thing on
shark teeth when I was little.

546
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,834
Hey, Phil.

547
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:13,500
Glad to see you're not exerting
yourself in this heat.

548
00:26:13,584 --> 00:26:15,375
Of course. Now he comes.

549
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:17,209
Soon as the Jersey tomatoes
are in season,

550
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:19,876
you can't keep these
New York guys away.

551
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:22,001
Fuck the tomatoes.
I'll take the <i>'scarole.</i>

552
00:26:22,084 --> 00:26:23,667
You know my brother Billy?

553
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,750
- Yeah. What do you say, Bill?
- How you doing?

554
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,001
Hey, Felicia? What?

555
00:26:28,084 --> 00:26:29,959
Those cases of toner
come in yet?

556
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:31,709
Yeah, it's in the trailer.

557
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:33,792
I'm gonna gas up.
I'll be right back.

558
00:26:35,876 --> 00:26:37,250
Toner cartridges now?

559
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,292
They're not skimming enough
from this job?

560
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:41,459
Fucking brother sells them
out of his trunk.

561
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:43,709
- Jesus.
- So, Patsy, the necklace.

562
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:45,333
How'd it go over
with the goomah?

563
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:47,126
Beautiful.
With the little emeralds?

564
00:26:47,209 --> 00:26:49,209
She fucking loved it.

565
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:52,500
First he gave her the emeralds,
then he gave her the pearls.

566
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:55,375
I got Ebel watches, too.

567
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:57,042
Earrings, whatever you need.

568
00:26:57,126 --> 00:26:59,042
My girl's birthday's coming up.

569
00:26:59,126 --> 00:27:00,333
Some rack on that girl.

570
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:03,292
Yeah, if you can get past
the sideburns.

571
00:27:04,075 --> 00:27:05,250
You should talk.

572
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:08,417
That skank I saw you with?
This girl's fucking moustache,

573
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,667
it must've been like
kissing a fireman.

574
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,417
Well, you ought to know,
sweetie.

575
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,459
Ooh.

576
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:17,709
What'd you say?

577
00:27:17,792 --> 00:27:19,084
Nothing, what?

578
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,500
We're just breaking balls.

579
00:27:20,584 --> 00:27:24,168
Finn, what time's
that game tonight?

580
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,417
8:00, I think.

581
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,917
I'm gonna take a piss.

582
00:27:28,001 --> 00:27:29,959
Do me a favor, huh?

583
00:27:30,042 --> 00:27:31,750
Hold this.

584
00:27:31,834 --> 00:27:33,001
Oh!

585
00:27:35,209 --> 00:27:36,417
I knew that was coming!

586
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,917
- My eye!
- Your eye?

587
00:27:38,001 --> 00:27:40,417
I'm sorry. I meant to hit you
in the fucking mouth!

588
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,584
Hey, oh.

589
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:44,001
Gene, Gene, relax.

590
00:27:44,084 --> 00:27:46,459
You okay? All right. Come on.

591
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,917
You made your point.

592
00:27:52,209 --> 00:27:53,459
Felicia, call an ambulance.

593
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:55,333
Use your own phone. I'm busy.

594
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:57,416
You been sick all day.
Why don't you take the day off.

595
00:27:57,417 --> 00:28:01,250
What about him? One of these
civilians calls the cops?

596
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:04,500
What? I think I seen a couple
of niggers running that way.

597
00:28:04,584 --> 00:28:06,375
Oh, yeah. Those two guys.

598
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:08,542
Need to rest?
You want some water?

599
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:09,834
You sure?

600
00:28:09,917 --> 00:28:11,834
Eugene Pontecorvo?

601
00:28:11,917 --> 00:28:13,959
He's so sweet.

602
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:16,500
Sweet? He was like an animal.

603
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:21,792
Are you gonna eat?

604
00:28:21,876 --> 00:28:24,001
I'm not hungry.
It's too hot anyway.

605
00:28:24,084 --> 00:28:26,168
I told you I was making
dinner tonight.

606
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,500
It's really good chili.

607
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:41,917
You should've seen these guys.

608
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:44,584
They were laughing.
It was fucking sick.

609
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:46,147
I mean, is this what
you grew up with?

610
00:28:46,209 --> 00:28:48,209
What are you talking about?

611
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:49,825
These people,
your dad's friends.

612
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:52,876
I never saw one bit
of violence growing up.

613
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:54,876
What about your dad's road rage?

614
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:56,708
And didn't you tell me
you had a boyfriend once

615
00:28:56,709 --> 00:28:58,584
who was killed,
shot to death or something?

616
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:01,126
First of all,
he was killed by drug dealers.

617
00:29:01,209 --> 00:29:04,126
African-Americans, if that
makes you feel any better.

618
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:09,417
You know, you talk
about these guys

619
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,417
like it's an anthropology class.

620
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,417
But the truth is,
they bring certain modes

621
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,876
of conflict resolution

622
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:17,084
from all the way back
in the old country.

623
00:29:17,168 --> 00:29:19,750
From the poverty
of the Mezzogiorno,

624
00:29:19,834 --> 00:29:22,209
where all higher authority
was corrupt.

625
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:26,168
...for the Lord Jesus Christ

626
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:29,375
will change our mortal bodies
to be like His in glory,

627
00:29:29,459 --> 00:29:30,750
for He is risen,

628
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:33,084
the firstborn from the dead.

629
00:29:33,168 --> 00:29:35,333
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection

630
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:38,625
unto eternal life
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

631
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:42,042
we commend to Almighty God
our brother Joseph,

632
00:29:42,126 --> 00:29:45,292
and we commit his body
to its resting place.

633
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:46,834
"Peeps"?

634
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:48,876
It's a fucking nickname.

635
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:50,876
Family name is Peparelli.

636
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:54,917
They're gonna redo it.

637
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:58,126
Fucking Jason.

638
00:29:58,209 --> 00:30:00,126
He's dyslexic.

639
00:30:00,209 --> 00:30:01,917
What's that got to do with it?

640
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:07,584
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust,

641
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:10,126
the Lord bless him and keep him.

642
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:13,625
The Lord make His face
to shine upon him.

643
00:30:13,709 --> 00:30:15,625
The Lord lift up
His countenance upon him

644
00:30:15,709 --> 00:30:17,375
and give him peace.

645
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:19,584
In the name of the Father,

646
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:20,876
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

647
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:24,250
- Amen.
- Amen.

648
00:30:26,709 --> 00:30:27,917
Amen.

649
00:30:44,001 --> 00:30:45,959
John. John. John.

650
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:50,375
Hey. I'm sorry about the stone.
It was a mistake. We'll fix it.

651
00:30:50,459 --> 00:30:53,001
You remember Micky Farrell?

652
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,168
Dock worker,
used to run Port Newark?

653
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,834
Guess who he saw on the
Upper West Side the other night.

654
00:30:57,917 --> 00:31:00,625
- Your fucking cousin Tony.
- So what does that mean?

655
00:31:00,709 --> 00:31:02,500
The same night Joey bought it?

656
00:31:02,584 --> 00:31:04,458
What, did you flip your
Maserati, hit your fuckin' head?

657
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:08,292
- You two-faced fuck!
- Oh, take it easy.

658
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:09,792
You wanna yell at somebody,

659
00:31:09,876 --> 00:31:12,042
the man you should be
talking to is right over there.

660
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:16,375
Fucking cocksucker.

661
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:20,168
I should fucking kill him
and his fucking wife,

662
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,126
- and your cousin next.
- Yeah, alright.

663
00:31:22,209 --> 00:31:25,168
Come on, let's take a walk.
Calm down, come on.

664
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:43,876
The fucking gall on that man!

665
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:46,084
His father must be spinning.

666
00:31:46,568 --> 00:31:48,442
You want my advice?

667
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,333
You go out there,
you shake his hand,

668
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:53,500
and you put this
fucking shit to bed.

669
00:31:53,584 --> 00:31:55,001
Shake his hand?

670
00:31:55,084 --> 00:31:57,209
Then he kisses the kid's mother?

671
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:59,041
That's the way it works, John.
You know that.

672
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,168
Sure, that's why
your cousin's here!

673
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,417
You are sincerely mistaken
if you think me or my cousin

674
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,100
had anything to do
with any of this shit.

675
00:32:06,168 --> 00:32:08,168
He was spotted
three blocks away.

676
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,750
By Micky Farrell.

677
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:12,209
You're gonna believe some
drunken Irish fucking prick

678
00:32:12,292 --> 00:32:13,750
over me?

679
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:18,500
Have a drink.

680
00:32:18,584 --> 00:32:21,333
- I don't want a fucking drink.
- Have one anyway.

681
00:32:25,876 --> 00:32:28,001
So how's your daughter doing?

682
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:31,917
She's good.

683
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:46,542
All right, maybe I'm wrong.

684
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:50,959
But you haven't been yourself
since the old man died.

685
00:32:53,876 --> 00:32:56,126
Lorraine Calluzzo.

686
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:59,042
Then you sink this idiot's boat.

687
00:33:00,459 --> 00:33:02,584
That's not
the Johnny Sack I know.

688
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:05,959
I'm waiting for
your explanation, Tony.

689
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,876
My cousin could not have been
in the city that night

690
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,792
'cause he was with me.

691
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:15,750
We were looking
for his daughter, John,

692
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:18,292
'cause she fucking disappeared.

693
00:33:20,209 --> 00:33:22,001
We were upstate, Monticello.

694
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:25,667
We'd heard Kelly had been living

695
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,001
with some fucking crackhead
up there.

696
00:33:28,084 --> 00:33:31,667
Matter of fact,
we were gonna reach out to you.

697
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:35,209
See if you could get
some of your people on it.

698
00:33:35,292 --> 00:33:39,917
I swear on my mother, Tony,
if I find out you're lying...

699
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:46,625
I'm sitting here humbling myself
out of friendship to you, John.

700
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:34,168
Oh! There he is!

701
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,834
"Three out of four
dentists surveyed."

702
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:37,001
Hey, how you doing?

703
00:34:37,084 --> 00:34:38,542
Where are you going? Come here.

704
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:47,292
Okay, settle this.

705
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:50,250
If they fought today,
both in their prime...

706
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:52,168
Ali or Tyson?

707
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,750
If you were laying a bet.

708
00:34:54,876 --> 00:34:56,126
Jeez, uh...

709
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,084
I... I really don't know.

710
00:34:59,168 --> 00:35:00,542
He don't know.

711
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:01,876
It's an opinion.

712
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:07,250
To tell you the truth,
after the other day,

713
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:09,084
I really don't want
to say the wrong thing.

714
00:35:09,168 --> 00:35:11,084
You see? This kid's all right.

715
00:35:11,168 --> 00:35:12,750
I should get back.

716
00:35:12,834 --> 00:35:14,333
Ramos'll be on my ass.

717
00:35:14,417 --> 00:35:17,292
Would you forget about Ramos,
for Christ's sakes?

718
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:18,667
I talked to him.

719
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:21,709
Sit.

720
00:35:21,792 --> 00:35:23,584
We got the good doughnuts today.

721
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,126
I'm fucking exhausted. I
hardly slept at all last night.

722
00:35:42,209 --> 00:35:43,292
So take a nap.

723
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:44,709
What are you worried about?

724
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:59,500
You got any idea the money
in that casino?

725
00:35:59,584 --> 00:36:01,542
And to give it to Tony B?

726
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:03,168
Guy's back on the street
two minutes,

727
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,959
gets a fuckin' promotion.

728
00:36:06,209 --> 00:36:07,876
Did you even
go to the fucking store?

729
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:10,084
They're in the freezer
like you like.

730
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,667
Now he's talking about
getting a maid, Tony B.

731
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,459
- Really?
- Guy gets out of jail,

732
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,667
suddenly I'm dog shit
in Tony's eye.

733
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,209
- Chrissy...
- It's true!

734
00:36:21,292 --> 00:36:23,459
Ever since I cleaned up,
no matter what he says,

735
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:25,625
Tony don't believe
a person can change.

736
00:36:25,709 --> 00:36:27,625
And this asshole
went to a shrink.

737
00:36:27,709 --> 00:36:29,500
Maybe he thinks
you're working too hard.

738
00:36:29,584 --> 00:36:31,542
North Carolina,
plus all that other stuff.

739
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:35,459
I can multi-task, Adriana.
I'm not a fucking retard.

740
00:36:35,542 --> 00:36:37,584
It's always some shit with him.

741
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:39,584
Side deals, secret promises.

742
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:41,667
He's always got an agenda.

743
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,168
What happened to not sweating
the small stuff, huh?

744
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,876
All's I know is,
I used to be number one cousin.

745
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:49,001
Now I'm being eased aside.

746
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:52,876
Your whole attitude in general.

747
00:36:55,992 --> 00:36:58,375
And while we're at it,
kindly remember what we said

748
00:36:58,459 --> 00:37:00,084
about interrupting
to ask for things

749
00:37:00,168 --> 00:37:01,667
while I'm on the telephone.

750
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,333
Okay, Mom.

751
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:05,625
Hello?

752
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:06,959
It's me.

753
00:37:07,042 --> 00:37:08,917
Hi, what's up?

754
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,375
Dale just told us he figured out
the rest of his life.

755
00:37:19,459 --> 00:37:21,250
You still thinking CIA?

756
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:22,500
Yeah, fight terror.

757
00:37:22,584 --> 00:37:25,042
Nah, I'm gonna
go to film school.

758
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:26,459
Me too.

759
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:39,084
I got to motor.

760
00:37:39,168 --> 00:37:41,709
You don't have to work
for, like, three hours.

761
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,042
He has to sleep a little.

762
00:37:45,042 --> 00:37:47,126
I'll get a ride with Alex.

763
00:37:47,209 --> 00:37:49,667
At this point it doesn't
even pay to go home.

764
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,917
Maybe I'll just crash at work.

765
00:37:52,001 --> 00:37:54,375
Felicia told me where she keeps
a key to the trailer.

766
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:55,709
Felicia told him.

767
00:37:55,792 --> 00:37:58,084
Uh-oh.

768
00:37:58,168 --> 00:38:00,001
Be careful driving.

769
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:01,584
All right. I'll see you tonight.

770
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:05,292
Later.

771
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:06,667
Bye.

772
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:17,333
Marone. You sound like
a racehorse pissing in there.

773
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,168
Hey, how's it going?

774
00:39:25,542 --> 00:39:27,499
You know, I never asked you
what your last name is.

775
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,709
It's DeTrolio.

776
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:32,500
Finn DeTrolio. My arch-nemesis.

777
00:39:32,584 --> 00:39:35,584
You enjoying yourself here?

778
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:37,042
It's all right.

779
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:40,001
I keep telling you,
you shouldn't work so hard.

780
00:39:40,084 --> 00:39:43,584
Long hours. This fucking heat.

781
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:46,209
Plus you came in so early today.

782
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:49,250
I just do what the job is.

783
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:51,584
Good.

784
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:53,459
You're strong.

785
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:54,917
That helps.

786
00:39:57,667 --> 00:39:59,792
You know you can call me Vito?

787
00:39:59,876 --> 00:40:01,375
Yeah, I-I know.

788
00:40:02,792 --> 00:40:04,917
So say it.

789
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:08,917
Let me hear you say,
"What's up, Vito?"

790
00:40:10,917 --> 00:40:12,001
What's up, Vito?

791
00:40:12,084 --> 00:40:13,333
Not much, Finn.

792
00:40:13,417 --> 00:40:15,084
Except I got a little
surprise for you.

793
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,667
Two tickets to see your Padres

794
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,084
take a beating
from the Yanks tonight.

795
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,042
Oh! Shit.

796
00:40:22,126 --> 00:40:23,834
Third baseline.

797
00:40:23,917 --> 00:40:25,667
Plus, it's bat night.

798
00:40:26,834 --> 00:40:28,709
That's really nice,
Vito, but I...

799
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,126
I'm... don't know if I can--

800
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:33,333
Don't pull that "aw shucks"
shit with me.

801
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:35,459
You're fucking going.

802
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:43,667
I'll see you under
the bat tonight.

803
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,375
Seven sharp.

804
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:48,333
And I don't like to miss
the national anthem.

805
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,792
So you're just not
gonna show up?

806
00:41:06,876 --> 00:41:08,042
You love baseball.

807
00:41:08,126 --> 00:41:09,333
What is wrong with you?

808
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:11,417
I don't like the guy, all right?

809
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:13,750
Right.

810
00:41:13,834 --> 00:41:15,292
I get it.

811
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:18,250
Dr. DeTrolio can't hang
with the common folk.

812
00:41:20,209 --> 00:41:22,333
He came on to me, all right?

813
00:41:22,417 --> 00:41:24,459
Either that,
or he wants to kill me.

814
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:25,625
What?

815
00:41:25,709 --> 00:41:27,250
I saw him blowing

816
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:29,500
some security guard
in the parking lot.

817
00:41:29,584 --> 00:41:32,750
When?
What are you talking about?

818
00:41:32,834 --> 00:41:34,126
This morning I showed up early.

819
00:41:34,209 --> 00:41:35,709
I didn't wanna
say anything, but...

820
00:41:36,917 --> 00:41:38,250
I'm really afraid of this guy.

821
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:42,084
Vito Spatafore
is a married man, Finn.

822
00:41:42,168 --> 00:41:44,542
I seriously doubt
he wants to kill you.

823
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:47,584
Well, maybe he wants
to fuck me and then kill me.

824
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,209
Wait a minute.

825
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:53,917
Is that why you got out
the suitcase?

826
00:41:54,001 --> 00:41:56,709
I am not going back to the site.

827
00:41:56,792 --> 00:41:59,001
Do you have any idea
the strings my father pulled

828
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:00,292
to get you that job?

829
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:02,001
And you just fucking quit?

830
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:04,250
I'm gonna hear so much bullshit!

831
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:05,959
So it's all about you, right?

832
00:42:06,042 --> 00:42:07,292
Is that all you can say

833
00:42:07,376 --> 00:42:09,509
whenever it's anything to do
with my feelings?

834
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,876
So you're going back
to Mission Viejo?

835
00:42:13,959 --> 00:42:15,542
I didn't say that.

836
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:17,667
Why don't you just admit it?
This whole thing...

837
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,250
the fight, the stuff with Vito,

838
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:22,250
it's really about you
not wanting to commit.

839
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:23,933
I'm right here.
We fucking live together.

840
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:25,333
But you got out a suitcase!

841
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,333
It's my process, okay?

842
00:42:27,417 --> 00:42:29,209
Look, you never can tell.

843
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:30,542
Your process?

844
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:31,876
About anything, the future.

845
00:42:31,959 --> 00:42:34,209
I was thinking out loud.

846
00:42:34,292 --> 00:42:36,001
Well, not out loud,
but in the action

847
00:42:36,084 --> 00:42:39,375
of getting out the suitcase,
I was thinking.

848
00:42:39,459 --> 00:42:40,876
Thinking of leaving!

849
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:42,084
No.

850
00:42:42,168 --> 00:42:43,292
Well, yes.

851
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:45,709
But... I'm still here.
I didn't go.

852
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:47,084
Fuck you!

853
00:42:47,168 --> 00:42:48,917
Right, great. Fuck me.

854
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:51,250
There was no abundant
intentionality

855
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:52,834
in me getting out the suitcase.

856
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:56,126
I can leave too, you know.
My friend Hunter's in Montreal.

857
00:42:56,209 --> 00:42:58,084
Do I know?
With the French roommate guy

858
00:42:58,168 --> 00:43:00,168
who was all over your ass
the time that we visited.

859
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:01,666
You don't think you keep
mentioning him

860
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:04,667
every 24 hours at a minimum?

861
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:10,417
Because he's thinking
of becoming an oral surgeon.

862
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,500
And you might have had
a new friend

863
00:43:12,584 --> 00:43:15,500
if you hadn't been
so obnoxious to him at the club!

864
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:19,417
Can we just stop fighting?

865
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,584
You got out a suitcase!

866
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:23,584
I'll put it back, okay?

867
00:43:40,792 --> 00:43:44,625
<i>Now batting for the Padres...</i>

868
00:43:53,001 --> 00:43:54,250
So it's not about us,

869
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:56,500
but suddenly you're
talking about options.

870
00:43:56,584 --> 00:43:58,834
Don't paraphrase what I said.

871
00:43:58,917 --> 00:44:02,084
I said this point in our lives
is a transition period

872
00:44:02,168 --> 00:44:05,209
forced on us by external events.

873
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:07,375
School is over for me.

874
00:44:07,459 --> 00:44:09,459
And next year for you.

875
00:44:09,542 --> 00:44:10,792
These are difficult choices.

876
00:44:10,876 --> 00:44:13,001
What, you'd rather not
have choices?

877
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:14,584
Thank God for choices.

878
00:44:14,667 --> 00:44:16,584
Stop your bullshit!

879
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:18,001
It's really simple.

880
00:44:18,084 --> 00:44:20,084
Are we going
to stay together or not?

881
00:44:20,168 --> 00:44:22,584
- If you want.
- That's not what I asked!

882
00:44:22,667 --> 00:44:24,417
- I said I did.
- And then you said,

883
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,916
"How are we going
to keep it together

884
00:44:25,917 --> 00:44:27,709
through four years
of dental school for you

885
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:29,750
and probably med school for me?"

886
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,834
Well, it's a good question.

887
00:44:31,917 --> 00:44:33,126
But why ask it now?

888
00:44:33,209 --> 00:44:34,959
Tonight of all times?

889
00:44:42,584 --> 00:44:44,001
Are you asleep?

890
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:46,750
- No.
- You were!

891
00:44:46,834 --> 00:44:49,500
And now you were gonna lie,
like you did about the suitcase.

892
00:44:49,584 --> 00:44:51,917
I did not lie
about the suitcase.

893
00:44:52,001 --> 00:44:54,292
Then what do you call it?

894
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:55,876
I don't know. I explained it.

895
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:57,416
Jesus, you should quit
the law center.

896
00:44:57,417 --> 00:44:59,297
You're like a prosecutor
at 4:00 in the morning.

897
00:44:59,375 --> 00:45:00,792
I can't think.

898
00:45:00,876 --> 00:45:03,084
How can you sleep when
we're in the middle of this?

899
00:45:03,168 --> 00:45:04,625
In the middle of what?

900
00:45:04,709 --> 00:45:06,917
All I said was I didn't want
to go back to the job site

901
00:45:07,001 --> 00:45:08,459
and maybe I should go home

902
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:10,584
until this thing with Vito
blows over.

903
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:12,001
But you didn't ask me to come!

904
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,876
You went right to the closet
and got out your suitcase!

905
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:16,792
Jesus Christ!

906
00:45:47,168 --> 00:45:49,459
Look, just stop crying, okay?

907
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:33,959
Why don't we just get married?

908
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,876
Married?

909
00:46:39,084 --> 00:46:40,459
Let's get engaged.

910
00:46:41,876 --> 00:46:43,333
Really?

911
00:46:43,417 --> 00:46:45,375
Why are you saying that now?

912
00:46:47,417 --> 00:46:49,042
I can't think. It's too late.

913
00:46:49,126 --> 00:46:51,375
It's just something
I feel very strongly.

914
00:46:52,834 --> 00:46:55,459
I was wondering
when I was gonna hear from you.

915
00:46:55,542 --> 00:46:57,459
I never got your statement.

916
00:46:57,542 --> 00:46:59,250
Well, actually,
that's why I called.

917
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:01,250
We hit a bit of a snag.

918
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:03,250
What kind of snag?

919
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:05,500
Well, I put a call in
to Phil Canter a few days ago,

920
00:47:05,584 --> 00:47:06,959
the forensic accountant.

921
00:47:07,042 --> 00:47:08,459
The one with
the vending machines.

922
00:47:08,542 --> 00:47:10,042
Then I didn't hear back
from him.

923
00:47:10,126 --> 00:47:12,459
Suddenly he called
and said he wasn't interested.

924
00:47:12,542 --> 00:47:14,876
So I called another accountant.

925
00:47:14,959 --> 00:47:16,250
And?

926
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,250
Frankly, when he heard
your husband was the defendant,

927
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:21,084
he demurred as well.

928
00:47:21,168 --> 00:47:23,500
So, what does this mean?
You don't want the case?

929
00:47:23,584 --> 00:47:25,709
Well, as my partners
reminded me,

930
00:47:25,792 --> 00:47:27,542
I do have a full
caseload already.

931
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:29,375
<i>I probably should have
mentioned--</i>

932
00:47:46,292 --> 00:47:48,584
And you were feeling
so positive.

933
00:47:48,667 --> 00:47:50,209
I woke up this morning,

934
00:47:50,292 --> 00:47:53,168
the depression
just washed over me.

935
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:56,292
You are dissolving
a 20-year marriage.

936
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:59,001
It's not my fucking
goddamn marriage, okay?

937
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,667
I had another panic attack.

938
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:08,959
And I thought
I had this shit beat!

939
00:48:09,042 --> 00:48:10,126
What happened?

940
00:48:10,209 --> 00:48:11,750
Playing golf
with a friend of mine,

941
00:48:11,834 --> 00:48:13,209
and he was...

942
00:48:14,834 --> 00:48:17,792
talking about this young guy
he knew who passed away, and...

943
00:48:19,292 --> 00:48:21,375
I guess I became
overcome with emotion,

944
00:48:21,459 --> 00:48:23,917
'cause they had to help me
off the tee.

945
00:48:29,001 --> 00:48:33,709
It's not the first time
it's happened recently.

946
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:35,209
I wish you had told me.

947
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:36,834
Yeah, well,
I wish you'd cured it.

948
00:48:41,584 --> 00:48:44,001
When the attacks
first reappeared,

949
00:48:44,084 --> 00:48:45,959
what was going on in your life?

950
00:48:46,042 --> 00:48:48,834
You had just rebuffed
my affections.

951
00:48:51,834 --> 00:48:54,834
When you actually passed out,
were you thinking about me, or--?

952
00:48:54,917 --> 00:48:59,458
I walked into my house,
and the cleaning girl was

953
00:48:59,682 --> 00:49:01,250
crying on the phone about her cousin

954
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:04,834
who went off the road in a
Mexican bus wreck or something.

955
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,876
And I remember
just feeling inside

956
00:49:08,959 --> 00:49:10,333
like I wanted
to fucking choke her

957
00:49:10,417 --> 00:49:12,792
'cause it was always
something with her.

958
00:49:15,126 --> 00:49:17,209
Next thing I know, boom!

959
00:49:17,292 --> 00:49:19,209
When did it next happen?

960
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:24,459
My cousin Tony
was up at the house.

961
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:29,459
He wanted to borrow some tools,
and they weren't there.

962
00:49:29,542 --> 00:49:32,625
I was inside talking to Carmela
and started to feel that...

963
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:35,584
...you know.

964
00:49:35,667 --> 00:49:37,168
And it passed.

965
00:49:38,625 --> 00:49:41,292
Your cousin was at your house?

966
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,625
Yeah.

967
00:49:42,709 --> 00:49:44,876
Tony Uncle whatever.

968
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,126
Uncle Al.

969
00:49:46,209 --> 00:49:49,292
And your maid was crying
about her cousin.

970
00:49:51,001 --> 00:49:53,709
And the other day
at the golf course...

971
00:49:54,917 --> 00:49:57,209
my cousin entered
into that, too.

972
00:49:57,292 --> 00:49:59,834
- In what way?
- He hurt his foot.

973
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:03,168
You were so concerned
about your cousin's foot

974
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,333
you collapsed
on the golf course?

975
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:08,834
I worry about him.

976
00:50:08,917 --> 00:50:10,500
He's a grown man, isn't he?

977
00:50:12,168 --> 00:50:14,709
Is he in danger
of losing the foot, or--?

978
00:50:14,792 --> 00:50:16,834
Fuck his foot!
It's not his foot!

979
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:18,459
Forget the foot!

980
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,168
I worry about him. He-he's...

981
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,042
right out of fucking jail, okay?

982
00:50:34,001 --> 00:50:35,625
All right, look...

983
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:40,333
The reason he went to prison

984
00:50:40,417 --> 00:50:44,333
is he got pinched hijacking
a truckload of Betamaxes in '86.

985
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:47,542
And they hooked him up on
a RICO, and he got 17 years.

986
00:50:49,084 --> 00:50:53,126
And I was supposed to be there
the night of the jacking.

987
00:50:57,333 --> 00:51:01,042
- I see.
- Oh, you see.

988
00:51:02,876 --> 00:51:04,084
Why didn't you go?

989
00:51:04,168 --> 00:51:05,709
I was jumped by a bunch
of moolinyans.

990
00:51:05,792 --> 00:51:07,417
They were trying
to take my shoes.

991
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,584
I fought 'em off, but they
cut my fuckin' head open,

992
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:13,001
the fuckin' jigaboo
cocksuckin' motherfuckers.

993
00:51:13,084 --> 00:51:14,584
Okay, forget that.

994
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:17,542
Your cousin went to prison.

995
00:51:17,625 --> 00:51:20,542
That's tremendous guilt
to carry.

996
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:22,500
He went to Nam, I was 4F.

997
00:51:22,584 --> 00:51:24,959
And that's the way
our friends look at it.

998
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,042
And that's why you favor
Tony Uncle Al...

999
00:51:29,126 --> 00:51:32,042
In those 17 years,
I did so good.

1000
00:51:32,126 --> 00:51:35,126
He lost his wife, his daughter.

1001
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:40,126
No wonder you're having
anxiety attacks.

1002
00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:41,917
Yeah.

1003
00:51:42,001 --> 00:51:44,333
Maybe if you came clean
with him?

1004
00:51:48,709 --> 00:51:50,459
Yeah, well... yeah.

1005
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:55,750
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1006
00:51:57,459 --> 00:52:00,750
Go on--go on--go on
with what you were saying.

1007
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:03,250
Are you having an attack now?

1008
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:05,126
No. No. I had a huge lunch,
that's all.

1009
00:52:05,209 --> 00:52:06,876
It's gas.

1010
00:52:06,959 --> 00:52:08,333
What is it, Anthony?

1011
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:11,959
Anthony?

1012
00:52:12,042 --> 00:52:13,402
All right,
the night he got pinched

1013
00:52:13,459 --> 00:52:15,417
I had a fucking panic attack,
all right?

1014
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,001
From my mother, goddamn it!

1015
00:52:17,084 --> 00:52:18,500
I didn't even know
what it was then!

1016
00:52:18,584 --> 00:52:20,126
All right, just relax.

1017
00:52:20,209 --> 00:52:22,250
Focus on your breathing.

1018
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:23,667
Slowly.

1019
00:52:24,876 --> 00:52:26,375
It's not that, I just...

1020
00:52:26,459 --> 00:52:28,625
I just need some fuckin'
Beano or something.

1021
00:52:28,709 --> 00:52:31,250
No, just please, focus.

1022
00:52:32,584 --> 00:52:34,667
I've got my medical bag in case.

1023
00:52:39,209 --> 00:52:40,584
Black guys.

1024
00:52:40,667 --> 00:52:42,209
My ass.

1025
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:46,910
I had a fight with my mother,

1026
00:52:46,959 --> 00:52:48,792
and I had a fucking
panic attack!

1027
00:52:48,876 --> 00:52:50,876
Okay, forget that for now.

1028
00:52:53,001 --> 00:52:55,667
Carmela was supposed to come
over with some fucking yarn

1029
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:59,584
for some bootees
my mother was making Meadow.

1030
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:03,333
She was late.

1031
00:53:03,417 --> 00:53:06,084
Oh, what the fuck.
Why go into it?

1032
00:53:06,168 --> 00:53:08,042
Close your eyes.

1033
00:53:08,126 --> 00:53:10,417
Focus on your breathing.

1034
00:53:16,542 --> 00:53:18,001
You want some water?

1035
00:53:18,084 --> 00:53:20,168
She was carrying on.

1036
00:53:25,792 --> 00:53:28,333
I said to her, I said,
"Carmela loves you.

1037
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:31,792
You know, you gotta understand it,
she's got a three-month-old."

1038
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:35,959
But she kept fucking...

1039
00:53:36,042 --> 00:53:37,375
she kept going,

1040
00:53:37,459 --> 00:53:38,876
and I started screaming at her.

1041
00:53:38,959 --> 00:53:40,542
So I left.
I walked out the door.

1042
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:43,126
I went over to the car,
I opened the door, boom!

1043
00:53:43,209 --> 00:53:45,042
Cut my fucking head open.

1044
00:53:45,126 --> 00:53:47,001
And your cousin
doesn't know this?

1045
00:53:47,084 --> 00:53:48,209
No! I lied!

1046
00:53:48,292 --> 00:53:49,459
What am I gonna tell him?

1047
00:53:49,542 --> 00:53:51,042
What am I gonna tell
all of them?

1048
00:53:53,542 --> 00:53:55,834
I had a fight with my mother,
and I fainted?

1049
00:53:55,917 --> 00:53:57,542
That's why I missed the job.

1050
00:54:04,584 --> 00:54:06,542
Jesus fucking Christ!

1051
00:54:09,084 --> 00:54:12,001
That's a lot
to get off your chest.

1052
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,542
I thought I was smart,

1053
00:54:15,625 --> 00:54:17,876
and that's why I bumped him up
and protect him.

1054
00:54:19,709 --> 00:54:22,500
Turns out I'm just
a fucking robot

1055
00:54:22,584 --> 00:54:25,459
to my own pussy-ass weakness.

1056
00:54:25,542 --> 00:54:28,375
He's also a capable person.

1057
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,917
You okay?

1058
00:54:36,084 --> 00:54:39,584
You know, sometimes what happens
in here is like taking a shit.

1059
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:41,250
Yes, okay.

1060
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:47,126
Although I prefer to think of it
more like childbirth.

1061
00:54:47,209 --> 00:54:48,542
Trust me.

1062
00:54:48,625 --> 00:54:51,042
It's like taking a shit.

1063
00:55:55,042 --> 00:55:56,168
Hello?

1064
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:58,667
Mom? I'm engaged.

1065
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,459
- What?
<i>- Finn proposed.</i>

1066
00:56:00,542 --> 00:56:02,625
- We're getting married.
- Are you sure?

1067
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:06,709
I mean, that's wonderful, honey.
I'm just so surprised!

1068
00:56:06,792 --> 00:56:08,084
I...

1069
00:56:08,168 --> 00:56:10,209
He's gonna finish dental school,
though, right?

1070
00:56:10,292 --> 00:56:11,834
<i>We're both finishing school.</i>

1071
00:56:11,917 --> 00:56:14,126
We're not getting married
till we have our degrees.

1072
00:56:14,209 --> 00:56:15,750
This is so exciting.

1073
00:56:15,834 --> 00:56:17,834
<i>I can't wait for you to
meet his parents.</i>

1074
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:19,375
Well, we'll have to
have a party.

1075
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:22,667
He's using his graduation present
to buy me a ring.

1076
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:25,792
That is so sweet.

1077
00:56:26,576 --> 00:56:28,733
I told him he shouldn't.

1078
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:32,792
Oh, my God, I'm gonna cry.

1079
00:56:32,876 --> 00:56:34,168
