The fuck?

32
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,676
Oh!

33
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,525
Shit!

34
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:31,593
So, "Blundino,"

35
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:33,385
why you fuck me like this?

36
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:35,551
Fuck you talking about?

37
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:38,259
I got a whole leg
covered with Neosporin.

38
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,676
I just spent an hour
with the cops

39
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,927
explaining how it went down.

40
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:43,426
I no forget you
professional criminal.

41
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,676
Let me ask you something.

42
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,802
If I really wanted to rob you,

43
00:02:46,826 --> 00:02:48,802
you think I'd have to put up
with this bullshit?

44
00:02:48,826 --> 00:02:51,609
Well, just so you know.

45
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:55,551
I didn't take your truck.

46
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:58,151
I lost my study guide,
my fucking flash cards.

47
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:02,593
I'm sick of this fucking
prejudice against ex-cons.

48
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:06,468
I never hire you if I no need
Tony Soprano for union.

49
00:03:06,492 --> 00:03:09,276
Not for him,
I show you the fucking window.

50
00:03:16,034 --> 00:03:17,468
Great.

51
00:03:17,492 --> 00:03:19,510
Hey, I thought you
liked the other one,

52
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:21,010
the Corn Pops.

53
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,802
Here, take it.

54
00:03:22,826 --> 00:03:24,859
What, no juice either?

55
00:03:25,784 --> 00:03:27,218
I told you, write it down,

56
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:28,991
I'll have the girl pick up
whatever you want.

57
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:30,343
She doesn't know the difference

58
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:32,343
between Fruit Roll-Ups
and Pop-Tarts.

59
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:34,551
I know, everybody's
an idiot to you.

60
00:03:34,575 --> 00:03:36,635
You know they got these places
called supermarkets

61
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,885
where you go and you buy
the things that you like.

62
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:41,609
I'll reimburse you.

63
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:44,609
And when am I supposed
to do that?

64
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:46,718
Well, as far as I can tell,

65
00:03:46,742 --> 00:03:48,426
you spend most of your time
on the phone,

66
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,718
or on the couch perfecting
that pissy look on your face.

67
00:03:50,742 --> 00:03:53,151
Add coming home drunk,
sounds like you.

68
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,950
What the fuck did you say to me?

69
00:03:57,951 --> 00:04:00,718
- Let the fuck go of me.
- Or what? Or what?

70
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:04,593
One of these days, you wait,
I'm gonna kick your fucking ass.

71
00:04:04,617 --> 00:04:06,802
What's wrong with right now,
then, huh?

72
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:08,859
What's wrong with right now?
Come on!

73
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:17,400
Blah.

74
00:04:25,784 --> 00:04:27,483
Now you got nothing.

75
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:50,551
- Thank you, Mary.
- You're welcome.

76
00:04:50,575 --> 00:04:53,343
I hated to call you in,
but I got this midterm report

77
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:56,984
from Mr. Fiske,
Anthony's English teacher.

78
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,510
And, well, it doesn't hit
the mail for a few days,

79
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:02,635
and I thought maybe
we could get a jump on it

80
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:04,968
and avert any real crisis.

81
00:05:04,992 --> 00:05:06,718
Wonderful, another crisis.

82
00:05:06,742 --> 00:05:08,968
He's still well below
the "C" average he needs

83
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:10,468
for the colleges we discussed.

84
00:05:10,492 --> 00:05:16,094
There is also an issue
with his five-paragraph essay.

85
00:05:16,118 --> 00:05:17,525
Animal Farm?

86
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:21,468
Anthony submitted his
one-line topic late.

87
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:22,927
Then two drafts.

88
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:26,010
The first was apparently
sketchy.

89
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,052
The second, Fiske said,

90
00:05:28,076 --> 00:05:31,525
was, uh, suspiciously cogent.

91
00:05:32,492 --> 00:05:34,426
Plagiarism.

92
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,343
He thinks my son cheated?

93
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:39,301
He spent an entire Saturday
afternoon at the library.

94
00:05:39,325 --> 00:05:41,593
I think it's obvious
what's going on here.

95
00:05:41,617 --> 00:05:43,218
What do you mean?

96
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,010
Anyone else shows
sudden improvement,

97
00:05:45,034 --> 00:05:46,218
he gets a gold star.

98
00:05:46,242 --> 00:05:47,510
My son gets his act together

99
00:05:47,534 --> 00:05:48,802
and suddenly he's a cheater?

100
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:51,010
I know what people think, Bob.

101
00:05:51,034 --> 00:05:54,176
Italian-American, father
in the carting industry...

102
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,760
Are you suggesting
some sort of bias,

103
00:05:55,784 --> 00:05:57,760
because that's a very
serious charge.

104
00:05:57,784 --> 00:06:00,551
I have met this Mr. Fiske.
He is a cold fish.

105
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:03,176
Couldn't you or one of
the other teachers talk to him?

106
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,359
Tell him how hard A.J.'s trying?

107
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,843
Nothing will make
a better argument

108
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:11,885
than continued effort
on A.J.'s part.

109
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:13,635
But, hey, there's still a shot.

110
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:16,094
This semester's grade
is heavily weighted

111
00:06:16,118 --> 00:06:18,301
on their term paper
on Lord of the Flies.

112
00:06:18,325 --> 00:06:20,109
God, my stomach is in knots.

113
00:06:24,742 --> 00:06:28,318
That's why I thought
it important that you come in.

114
00:06:32,951 --> 00:06:34,718
Though it, uh...

115
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:37,885
did take me about an hour
to decide what to wear.

116
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:40,010
Me too.

117
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:43,359
Does that mean you've thought
about my dinner offer?

118
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:46,176
I probably shouldn't say this,

119
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,692
but I have thought about
nothing else since you called.

120
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,301
Well, we can't do justice
to any discussion

121
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:53,968
of Madame Bovary over the phone.

122
00:06:53,992 --> 00:06:57,026
That's the thing, though.
That book was way over my head.

123
00:06:58,325 --> 00:07:00,593
Why would you even be
interested in someone like me?

124
00:07:00,617 --> 00:07:03,635
Because of just that.
I mean, who admits this stuff?

125
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:05,176
Not only are you
very attractive,

126
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,593
you're unpretentious,
you say what's on your mind.

127
00:07:07,617 --> 00:07:10,593
I'm a big mouth. I see how that
would attract a man like you.

128
00:07:10,617 --> 00:07:13,593
So should we grab a meal or not?

129
00:07:13,617 --> 00:07:15,760
Well, there are other things
to think about.

130
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:17,259
My husband, for one.

131
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:19,468
Well, your husband's gonna
have to get used to the idea

132
00:07:19,492 --> 00:07:20,900
that your life is moving on.

133
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,859
I'm not worried about my life.

134
00:07:25,076 --> 00:07:27,259
Oh, you know what?

135
00:07:27,283 --> 00:07:29,135
Call me naive,
but in this day and age,

136
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:31,718
I don't really think
your husband, if he found out,

137
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,968
is going to break
his son's teacher's legs.

138
00:07:34,992 --> 00:07:36,551
Not to mention
how that would play

139
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:38,984
in the admissions office
at Arizona State.

140
00:07:44,826 --> 00:07:47,109
I don't get it.
What's so funny about that?

141
00:07:51,076 --> 00:07:53,676
Honey? Aren't you gonna
eat something?

142
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,385
Janice made lasagna.

143
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:58,010
It's not so great, but you
need something on your stomach.

144
00:07:58,034 --> 00:07:59,176
We're gonna go.

145
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,010
Gotta stop at my mother's.

146
00:08:01,034 --> 00:08:02,385
Gwen just told us how you met.

147
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:04,525
They let you use
the Internet in the can?

148
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,927
They let you post an ad.

149
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:10,151
I gotta read some of that shit.
I bet it's hysterical.

150
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:15,052
He's trying to concentrate.

151
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:17,900
Vascular physiology.

152
00:08:18,784 --> 00:08:20,609
Neurotomy.

153
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:23,259
Shit.

154
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:25,676
T. made it out like
it was a big gym test.

155
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,010
Some people don't realize
what massage involves.

156
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:31,135
I'm practically doing two years
of medical school on my own.

157
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:32,551
One thing I learned in recovery,

158
00:08:32,575 --> 00:08:34,510
other people's
definitions of you?

159
00:08:34,534 --> 00:08:37,218
Sometimes they're more about
making themselves feel better.

160
00:08:37,242 --> 00:08:38,968
You gotta define yourself.

161
00:08:38,992 --> 00:08:41,442
Keep your eye on the tiger, man.

162
00:08:44,575 --> 00:08:46,318
- See you, Ton'.
- Bye.

163
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:50,718
I suppose I could speak
with Monsignor Bava,

164
00:08:50,742 --> 00:08:52,802
have him call his nephew
at K-Mart.

165
00:08:52,826 --> 00:08:55,426
That'll fix us in
the Huggies department.

166
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,468
Well, the diaper drive
covers Clothe the Naked.

167
00:08:58,492 --> 00:09:00,176
What do you say we work
on feed the hungry?

168
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,635
Ah, this looks delicious.

169
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:05,151
Thanks for inviting me, Carm.
Pleasant surprise, indeed.

170
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:08,551
So how goes life these days?

171
00:09:08,575 --> 00:09:12,718
Actually, I think
I met somebody.

172
00:09:12,742 --> 00:09:14,094
Really?

173
00:09:14,118 --> 00:09:15,843
Just kind of happened.

174
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:18,635
We had been working
on this project together,

175
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:21,259
and suddenly we both realized

176
00:09:21,283 --> 00:09:23,942
that there were
certain feelings.

177
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:26,843
And I like him as a person, too,
of course.

178
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,301
Don't get me wrong.

179
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:30,843
The funny thing is,
I was sure he was gay.

180
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:32,400
He sort of reminded me of you.

181
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,510
You know, he's an intellectual.

182
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:36,968
You know what I mean.

183
00:09:36,992 --> 00:09:39,010
Anyway, we had been friends,
I guess,

184
00:09:39,034 --> 00:09:42,510
and then he called
to ask me out,

185
00:09:42,534 --> 00:09:45,676
and suddenly all
the formality dropped away.

186
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,176
When I saw him the other day,

187
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,426
he looked at me
with this intensity.

188
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,885
Now, I know it's wrong,

189
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:54,692
but the truth is,
I feel it, too.

190
00:09:58,118 --> 00:10:00,385
You know, if you really want
to discuss this,

191
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:03,650
I think we should include Tony
in the conversation as well.

192
00:10:05,118 --> 00:10:08,468
Why--why are you sounding,
I don't know, kind of hostile?

193
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:10,359
I'm not.

194
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:13,259
Perhaps that's your sin talking.

195
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:15,010
This is none of Tony's business.

196
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:16,385
Who knows what he's been up to,

197
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:18,052
and not just during
the separation either.

198
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,510
That doesn't change the fact

199
00:10:19,534 --> 00:10:21,426
you made a commitment
to each other before God.

200
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,468
Maybe you should send the papal
nuncio to Tony and remind him of that.

201
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:27,301
Why am I the only one
held to any kind of standards?

202
00:10:27,325 --> 00:10:29,593
And for that matter,
if this is wrong,

203
00:10:29,617 --> 00:10:31,635
why did God put this man
in my life?

204
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:33,927
Is it God that put him there,

205
00:10:33,951 --> 00:10:37,176
or is there a particular
need you have right now?

206
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,067
See, I never understand this.
Didn't he put the need there?

207
00:10:48,118 --> 00:10:49,900
Say when, signor.

208
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:59,151
You! Office!

209
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,094
5:15. I haven't punched in yet.

210
00:11:02,118 --> 00:11:03,525
This is still my time.

211
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:14,510
Yeah?

212
00:11:14,534 --> 00:11:16,176
I give you a hard time

213
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,676
about my truck the other day.

214
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,843
Cops find two kids.

215
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:22,385
Feel free to apologize any time.

216
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:24,551
Anyway, they investigate.

217
00:11:24,575 --> 00:11:26,094
Could be joyride.

218
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:30,426
But I think maybe behind it
is my cousin at Northside.

219
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,109
- Do you know if they found my books?
- Who knows.

220
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:39,676
You study hard
for massage, yeah?

221
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,718
The licensing test
is pretty hard.

222
00:11:42,742 --> 00:11:44,468
Huge failure rate.

223
00:11:44,492 --> 00:11:46,276
If you pass,
then what you do with this?

224
00:11:48,034 --> 00:11:49,802
Be a professional masseur.

225
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:52,176
You no think
of "massagie ghageh"?

226
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,426
You know, small sauna.

227
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,218
Yeah, I could see it.

228
00:11:56,242 --> 00:11:58,551
Four or five tables,
soothing atmosphere.

229
00:11:58,575 --> 00:12:00,567
Pipe in a little Keith Jarrett.

230
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,843
First thing I get
stuck with you I think,

231
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:06,176
oh, shit goddamn it.

232
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,218
He lazy American and criminal.

233
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:10,426
No good for Kim.

234
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:14,385
But you work for Kim and future.

235
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:16,176
Like Korean people.

236
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,676
I wouldn't say that.

237
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,094
I come from Korea.

238
00:12:20,118 --> 00:12:23,525
Only new shoes
and Uncle's address.

239
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:25,802
Worse than prison.

240
00:12:25,826 --> 00:12:28,176
But I become
"jah-soo-suhng-gah."

241
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,343
The boss.

242
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:32,010
That's why I try to help you.

243
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:33,593
Help me how?

244
00:12:33,617 --> 00:12:34,885
What are you talking about?

245
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:38,859
I stake you the money
in the storefront.

246
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:44,094
I got a travel agency

247
00:12:44,118 --> 00:12:47,426
in mini mall
over at West Caldwell.

248
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:52,318
Shitty business with a fucking
three-year lease.

249
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,218
You know, my daughter,

250
00:12:58,242 --> 00:13:00,885
very interest, in massage.

251
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:02,968
Physical therapy.
Top of two-thirds class.

252
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:05,635
Good for her.
It's a tough nut to crack.

253
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,885
She no like physical
therapy no more.

254
00:13:08,909 --> 00:13:11,135
Cripple people make her sad.

255
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:15,259
Now, she watch TV,
live at home, do nothing.

256
00:13:15,283 --> 00:13:18,968
You pass test then you,
me, my daughter,

257
00:13:18,992 --> 00:13:21,234
we make the big success journey.

258
00:13:22,325 --> 00:13:23,692
Okay?

259
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:27,010
Jesus.

260
00:13:27,034 --> 00:13:29,151
Yeah, all right.

261
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,676
I-I don't know what to say, Kim.

262
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,067
Thanks.

263
00:13:41,617 --> 00:13:43,510
I laid it out for him.

264
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:44,802
He wants to move back here,

265
00:13:44,826 --> 00:13:46,760
it's gotta be with
your full approval.

266
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,318
This was your idea?

267
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:51,676
It was mutual.

268
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,176
He's upset because he don't
get the kind of cereal he likes.

269
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,593
He threw it in the sink.

270
00:13:55,617 --> 00:13:57,927
How am I supposed to focus
at school with no breakfast?

271
00:13:57,951 --> 00:13:59,218
I got dizzy.

272
00:14:00,142 --> 00:14:01,843
I'm sorry, I don't
see why the two of you

273
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:03,241
can't work this out
between yourselves.

274
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,676
Maybe I don't
wanna live in a place

275
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,843
where people use violence
against children.

276
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:10,067
Violence? You're lucky I didn't
put my shoe up your ass.

277
00:14:10,076 --> 00:14:13,760
You see? Now that's abuse.
I know what my rights are.

278
00:14:13,784 --> 00:14:16,094
I can call social services
and they'll send a case worker.

279
00:14:16,118 --> 00:14:18,026
Go ahead!
He'll get the other shoe!

280
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:22,385
- This is demoralizing.
- Well, now maybe you see...

281
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:23,825
That a son of mine
would even consider

282
00:14:23,826 --> 00:14:26,343
calling in the authorities.

283
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:29,635
- Go ahead, live where you want.
- Fine.

284
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:31,026
Family meeting?

285
00:14:31,826 --> 00:14:33,301
Try to stay awake, A.J.

286
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:34,859
Keep walking.

287
00:14:38,742 --> 00:14:40,551
I-I just want my old room back.

288
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:42,218
You wanted to live
with your father, A.J.

289
00:14:42,242 --> 00:14:44,259
- Live with your decision.
- I don't like it there.

290
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,094
That's funny,
I thought I was the problem.

291
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:47,385
I make you miserable, remember?

292
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:49,718
- Well, I never said that.
- You did.

293
00:14:49,742 --> 00:14:51,234
Absolutely.

294
00:15:00,992 --> 00:15:03,551
For me to even consider
having you back,

295
00:15:03,575 --> 00:15:05,259
we're gonna have to establish

296
00:15:05,283 --> 00:15:07,094
some nonnegotiable ground rules.

297
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:09,775
- Like what kind?
- Let your mother talk.

298
00:15:11,617 --> 00:15:14,218
First and foremost,
school comes first.

299
00:15:14,242 --> 00:15:17,301
That means putting the brakes
on your social life:

300
00:15:17,325 --> 00:15:19,676
parties, phone calls, Devin.

301
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,426
You are at a crisis point
grade-wise,

302
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,650
so you will make sure your work
is done on time and correctly.

303
00:15:29,034 --> 00:15:30,176
All right.

304
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,259
I will not tolerate cursing.

305
00:15:32,283 --> 00:15:34,616
After 16 years of uninterrupted
potty mouth from you people,

306
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:36,718
- I get slammed?
- This is my house.

307
00:15:36,742 --> 00:15:38,343
You will treat me with respect.

308
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:41,151
Well, is that it?

309
00:15:45,742 --> 00:15:48,609
I want you to involve me
in your life a little.

310
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,483
Fine.

311
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,843
All right.

312
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:01,483
Go get your stuff from the car.

313
00:16:26,325 --> 00:16:28,318
We played that just right.

314
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:32,468
Think his time
over there with me

315
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,067
whipped him into shape a little.

316
00:16:34,992 --> 00:16:36,442
Hmm.

317
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,067
Think you'll see a difference.

318
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:53,010
Which muscles attach
to the coracoid process?

319
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:55,468
Okay, I fucking know this.

320
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:57,426
It's on the tip of my tongue.

321
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,510
Oh, fucking study hall again.

322
00:16:59,534 --> 00:17:02,176
Vito, where the fuck
is my Tupperware?

323
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,343
Keep your shirt on.

324
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:05,135
My wife's bringing it down
this afternoon.

325
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:08,968
Pectoralis minor and
the coracobrachialis, of course.

326
00:17:08,992 --> 00:17:10,318
And...

327
00:17:11,283 --> 00:17:13,010
Come on.

328
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:14,218
Even I know this.

329
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,343
- Fuck, fine, what is it?
- Biceps!

330
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:17,802
Fuck.

331
00:17:17,826 --> 00:17:19,510
Oh, fuck, I knew that.

332
00:17:19,534 --> 00:17:21,176
My mind's all over the place.

333
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,593
Fear knocked at the door.

334
00:17:22,617 --> 00:17:24,718
Faith answered.
There was no one there.

335
00:17:24,742 --> 00:17:26,135
Why do you wanna do this?

336
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:27,885
So you can touch
a bunch a strangers?

337
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:29,616
You really skeeve
the human body, don't you?

338
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:32,052
You like this so much,
let me ask you a question.

339
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:33,885
Why do pissing,
shitting and fucking

340
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:35,802
all happen within
a two-inch radius?

341
00:17:35,826 --> 00:17:38,885
Everybody asks that, Paulie.
There's no answer for it.

342
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:40,510
They're all sources of pleasure,
though.

343
00:17:40,534 --> 00:17:42,052
Get the fuck outta here!

344
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:43,991
I know this shit, then the next
minute it's gone.

345
00:17:43,992 --> 00:17:46,158
I don't know
how you do it, working full time.

346
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:47,760
If your parole officer's
a problem,

347
00:17:47,784 --> 00:17:49,301
give our guy Jimmy Curran
a call.

348
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:51,094
- He's a supervisor.
- It's not that.

349
00:17:51,118 --> 00:17:54,343
It's just all this pressure
now that I got this opportunity.

350
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:56,343
Sungyon Kim, my boss,

351
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,052
he's gonna back me on a whole
storefront operation.

352
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:00,510
The Korean?

353
00:18:00,534 --> 00:18:02,843
You're looking for money,
why not come to me?

354
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:04,843
Well, this is different.

355
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:09,551
This self-owned business shit's
like a religion to these people.

356
00:18:09,575 --> 00:18:13,067
Plus, the guy sees
something in me.

357
00:18:15,742 --> 00:18:18,176
You know, in some ways,

358
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,760
the whole prison thing
is not that different

359
00:18:20,784 --> 00:18:23,151
from being an immigrant.

360
00:18:24,617 --> 00:18:27,718
Word to the wise,
remember Pearl Harbor.

361
00:18:27,742 --> 00:18:30,400
We really were
the last people in there.

362
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,259
At least they were
subtle about it.

363
00:18:33,283 --> 00:18:36,192
Was it stacking of chairs
or the running the vacuum?

364
00:18:52,742 --> 00:18:54,301
Relax.

365
00:18:54,325 --> 00:18:55,942
Sorry.

366
00:18:57,909 --> 00:18:59,426
Madame Bovary.

367
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,802
It's a first edition.

368
00:19:00,826 --> 00:19:03,775
Well, Modern Library's
first edition.

369
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:06,734
Thank you, that is so sweet.

370
00:19:08,283 --> 00:19:09,676
Honestly, though, I don't know.

371
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,968
The story's very slow.
Nothing really happens.

372
00:19:12,992 --> 00:19:15,176
I think he could've said
what he has to say with

373
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,426
a lot less words.

374
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,635
Outside, nothing happens.

375
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:19,593
But inside,
she has these extremes

376
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,094
of boredom and exhilaration.

377
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:23,775
You should try it again.

378
00:19:26,118 --> 00:19:29,218
And what a wonderful thing
to have in a den.

379
00:19:29,242 --> 00:19:32,567
You know, you look really
beautiful in this light.

380
00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:40,385
I don't do this a lot.

381
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:41,942
Do what?

382
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:45,802
Sitting in a car, with a man,

383
00:19:45,826 --> 00:19:48,468
not really knowing what to do.

384
00:19:48,492 --> 00:19:50,942
Or if I should at all.

385
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:53,052
And feeling like some teenager

386
00:19:53,076 --> 00:19:54,734
which was, believe it or not...

387
00:20:10,283 --> 00:20:12,026
I have to tell you...

388
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:15,426
I haven't been with anyone.

389
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,234
You're a virgin?
This is my lucky night.

390
00:20:19,325 --> 00:20:21,359
Stop with the jokes.

391
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,942
I'm so glad you're here.

392
00:22:16,492 --> 00:22:17,927
So, how was it?

393
00:22:17,951 --> 00:22:19,775
Oh, cut it out.

394
00:22:22,283 --> 00:22:24,426
So, what is Abelard and Heloise?

395
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,927
It looks religious.

396
00:22:25,951 --> 00:22:28,067
I just like to read in there.

397
00:22:31,534 --> 00:22:33,885
It's the classic story.

398
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:35,635
A 12th-century scholar
falls in love

399
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:37,676
with his underage student.

400
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,927
Gets her pregnant.

401
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:41,343
God, in the 12th century.

402
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:42,802
And they're found out.

403
00:22:42,826 --> 00:22:46,318
And her uncle, the abbot,
has him castrated.

404
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,109
It's timeless, really.

405
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:53,802
Even though he becomes
a monk and she a nun,

406
00:22:53,826 --> 00:22:56,426
their passion burns on
through these incredible letters

407
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,234
through the rest of their lives.

408
00:22:59,575 --> 00:23:01,927
You, with these books.

409
00:23:01,951 --> 00:23:03,843
Education should never stop.

410
00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:06,650
It enriches all aspects of life.

411
00:23:07,534 --> 00:23:08,900
I know.

412
00:23:10,242 --> 00:23:13,760
I wish someone could
convince A.J. of that.

413
00:23:13,784 --> 00:23:15,843
I keep thinking he could
start over in college,

414
00:23:15,867 --> 00:23:18,052
but who knows if he's
even gonna get the chance?

415
00:23:18,076 --> 00:23:19,551
He will.

416
00:23:19,575 --> 00:23:21,483
All our students matriculate.

417
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,843
You gotta be fucking kidding.

418
00:23:37,867 --> 00:23:40,151
No way.

419
00:24:56,492 --> 00:24:57,760
Why do they take so long?

420
00:24:57,784 --> 00:24:59,704
All they have to do
is spit out the results.

421
00:25:00,784 --> 00:25:05,676
5-6-2-4-7-3-7-32-11.

422
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,593
That's me. Blundetto.

423
00:25:07,617 --> 00:25:09,968
I'm only authorized
to inform you

424
00:25:09,992 --> 00:25:11,301
that your score meets or exceeds

425
00:25:11,325 --> 00:25:13,343
the required minimum
for licensure,

426
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:16,468
and you're now board-certified
in massage and bodywork

427
00:25:16,492 --> 00:25:18,276
by the state of New Jersey.

428
00:25:20,534 --> 00:25:21,843
Honey, you passed.

429
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:23,734
You passed.

430
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:27,151
Oh, Jesus.

431
00:25:30,325 --> 00:25:32,984
I couldn't have done it alone.

432
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,426
Oh, my God, look at you.

433
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:41,067
You did it, baby. You did it.

434
00:25:42,242 --> 00:25:44,385
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

435
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:47,301
It's been a month
since my last confession.

436
00:25:47,325 --> 00:25:48,692
Carmela?

437
00:25:49,867 --> 00:25:51,234
I had sex with that man.

438
00:25:55,409 --> 00:25:58,052
I know we talked
about commitment,

439
00:25:58,076 --> 00:26:00,885
and the sacrament of marriage.

440
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:02,400
But...

441
00:26:04,034 --> 00:26:05,426
I don't know.

442
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,135
You sound remorseful.

443
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:08,259
I am.

444
00:26:08,283 --> 00:26:09,843
I'm also confused, though.

445
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:11,907
The truth is, I have been
walking around on a cloud,

446
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:14,359
like Maria in West Side Story.

447
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,567
It's not right.

448
00:26:21,867 --> 00:26:24,010
Have you heard of
Abelard and Eloise?

449
00:26:24,034 --> 00:26:25,885
I think it's "Heloise,"

450
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:28,510
and from what I remember
it ends badly.

451
00:26:28,534 --> 00:26:30,052
I know, exactly.

452
00:26:30,076 --> 00:26:33,692
But, something in me
has been reawakened.

453
00:26:35,242 --> 00:26:37,301
And even if it never
happens again with this man,

454
00:26:37,325 --> 00:26:40,176
just knowing that feeling
of passion again.

455
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,176
I don't know if it's ever
gonna go away.

456
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,510
I'll need it.

457
00:26:43,534 --> 00:26:46,135
If it never happens again?

458
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,551
Carmela, I can't
absolve you of a sin

459
00:26:48,575 --> 00:26:50,259
you're going to continue
to commit.

460
00:26:50,283 --> 00:26:54,859
You need to show resolve,
a firm purpose to change.

461
00:26:55,867 --> 00:26:57,176
Yeah, I know, I know.

462
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,802
So this man takes you
to restaurants,

463
00:27:00,826 --> 00:27:03,052
fulfills certain
physical desires.

464
00:27:03,076 --> 00:27:04,426
Tells jokes.

465
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:07,385
But will he be there
beyond the here and now?

466
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:09,676
When you're too old
to walk to the bathroom,

467
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,468
will he be there to help you?

468
00:27:11,492 --> 00:27:12,984
What, and you think Tony will?

469
00:27:13,826 --> 00:27:16,301
Carmela, you took a vow.

470
00:27:16,325 --> 00:27:18,635
You both did.

471
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:22,094
For your penance, I want you
to do something kind for Tony.

472
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:23,635
I don't think I can, Father.

473
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:25,551
Then pray for him.

474
00:27:25,575 --> 00:27:27,593
Not only that God
will touch his heart,

475
00:27:27,617 --> 00:27:30,609
but that he'll touch
yours as well.

476
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:41,676
It's not much now, of course,

477
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,593
but it's a pretty
flexible space.

478
00:27:43,617 --> 00:27:45,301
Plus you got the dog groomer
next door,

479
00:27:45,325 --> 00:27:47,760
in case your Korean friend
wants some lunch.

480
00:27:47,784 --> 00:27:49,259
You know they really do
eat dogs.

481
00:27:49,283 --> 00:27:50,885
I mean, not all of them,
but I asked Kim.

482
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:52,343
Aw, Jesus Christ.

483
00:27:52,367 --> 00:27:54,301
So I'm thinking of building
a row of rooms here

484
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:55,718
with different themes.

485
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:57,259
Asian for shiatsu,

486
00:27:57,283 --> 00:27:59,343
a little Danish thing
for Rolfing,

487
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:01,192
even though technically
it's Swedish.

488
00:28:02,325 --> 00:28:05,843
Well, sounds like
it's all coming together.

489
00:28:05,867 --> 00:28:07,843
Look, Ton',
I know you're disappointed.

490
00:28:07,867 --> 00:28:09,718
What the fuck you talking about?

491
00:28:09,742 --> 00:28:12,885
The way things turned out
since I left the can.

492
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:15,151
Going civilian.

493
00:28:18,992 --> 00:28:22,718
Over here I'm gonna put
an oasis with big plants,

494
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,942
like a waiting area
for the customers.

495
00:28:25,826 --> 00:28:27,468
Could buy some $30 hand cream

496
00:28:27,492 --> 00:28:29,968
while they look at one of those
fountains with the koi in it.

497
00:28:29,992 --> 00:28:31,551
Oh, I can get you the koi.

498
00:28:31,575 --> 00:28:34,426
Really? Giant carp?
How the fuck do you get that?

499
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,885
It's done.

500
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:37,343
Don't give it another thought.

501
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:39,301
Tony, you here?

502
00:28:39,325 --> 00:28:40,551
- Yeah!
- Out front.

503
00:28:40,575 --> 00:28:42,052
Hey. I came by to get the keys.

504
00:28:42,076 --> 00:28:43,426
I would have gone
by the laundry,

505
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,218
but my dad's such
a hard-on at work.

506
00:28:45,242 --> 00:28:46,760
Tell me about it.

507
00:28:46,784 --> 00:28:48,468
Amanda, this is my cousin, Tony.

508
00:28:48,492 --> 00:28:50,510
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you?

509
00:28:50,534 --> 00:28:53,468
Hey, you believe there's
a dog groomer there?

510
00:28:53,492 --> 00:28:55,567
In case somebody needs a snack?

511
00:28:57,534 --> 00:28:58,885
Place is nice.

512
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:00,135
A little paint, maybe...

513
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,760
Amanda, this is
my cousin Christopher.

514
00:29:01,784 --> 00:29:04,343
Hey.

515
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,885
So, I met this guy
at a club on Canal.

516
00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:09,802
He says he can hook us up
with ginseng, fake rhino,

517
00:29:09,826 --> 00:29:11,426
nerve tea, all that herbal shit.

518
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,343
We could keep it up front
with the koi thing,

519
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:15,324
- if we're still doing that.
- Koi's taken care of.

520
00:29:15,325 --> 00:29:19,984
Well, I gotta book.
Nice meeting you guys.

521
00:29:24,325 --> 00:29:25,685
What's she here for,
happy endings?

522
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,468
She's not gonna
do massage at all.

523
00:29:27,492 --> 00:29:29,676
She's Kim's daughter.
She's trying to find herself.

524
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,176
She'll do the books and shit.

525
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,760
Oh. Nice ass.

526
00:29:32,784 --> 00:29:34,676
The ceiling tiles
come right out,

527
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,843
so I can install
the sound system myself.

528
00:29:36,867 --> 00:29:38,094
Think you could put in a word

529
00:29:38,118 --> 00:29:39,718
with number one daughter there?

530
00:29:39,742 --> 00:29:41,135
- For what?
- You know.

531
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:42,760
Get some of that
kung-pao coochie.

532
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,817
You fuckin' guys,
this is important to me.

533
00:29:48,742 --> 00:29:51,135
Sex agrees with you.
You look great.

534
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:52,885
You're being discreet, right?

535
00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:56,676
Well, sneaking around
is actually half the fun.

536
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,760
It's like you have
this secret, you know,

537
00:29:58,784 --> 00:30:00,135
you wanna scream to the world...

538
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,802
Yeah, but do yourself
a favor, though, huh?

539
00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:04,010
Yeah.

540
00:30:04,034 --> 00:30:06,192
So how was it?

541
00:30:07,992 --> 00:30:10,135
I will say that
he took his time.

542
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,968
Oh, you're not
getting off that easy.

543
00:30:11,992 --> 00:30:13,802
Come on, details. Come on.

544
00:30:13,826 --> 00:30:15,135
Hello there.

545
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:18,525
- Hey, A.J.
- Hey, Aunt Ro.

546
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,010
How was school?

547
00:30:21,034 --> 00:30:22,968
It sucked.

548
00:30:22,992 --> 00:30:25,760
Mr. Wegler pulled me
out of language lab

549
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:27,259
to go over my term paper notes.

550
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,843
I didn't have my stuff with me,

551
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:30,927
so he puts his faggy hand
on my shoulder and says,

552
00:30:30,951 --> 00:30:32,426
"Do your best."

553
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,426
Well, that's his job,
to get you into college.

554
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:36,426
Or maybe he's just a big homo.

555
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,635
Could be.

556
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:39,176
I'm making ziti for dinner.

557
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,234
Go start your assignments.
I will call you.

558
00:30:42,492 --> 00:30:44,010
Could I watch TV first?

559
00:30:44,034 --> 00:30:46,301
Promise me
you're gonna work later.

560
00:30:46,325 --> 00:30:48,900
- But you gotta help me.
- I will.

561
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:01,635
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, my Jackie...

562
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,109
Oh, honey.

563
00:31:04,367 --> 00:31:07,567
They never caught those
goddamn Chinks who killed him.

564
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:11,359
Oh, my God, it hurts.

565
00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:16,426
So I'm finding the other copy
when Gene, the actuary,

566
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,968
completely unloads on me.

567
00:31:17,992 --> 00:31:19,218
Jerk.

568
00:31:19,242 --> 00:31:20,885
Like yelling's gonna
make me do anything

569
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:22,551
but screw up more.

570
00:31:22,575 --> 00:31:25,094
You know, you have to remember
that when you're the boss.

571
00:31:25,118 --> 00:31:26,718
The boss.

572
00:31:26,742 --> 00:31:28,359
It's amazing, isn't it?

573
00:31:38,534 --> 00:31:41,109
Jerks. Garbage pails
are right there.

574
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:47,692
Come on.

575
00:31:54,784 --> 00:31:56,885
- Holy fuck.
- What?

576
00:31:56,909 --> 00:31:59,026
Oh, my God, is it a fetus?

577
00:32:01,283 --> 00:32:02,927
Oh my God!

578
00:32:02,951 --> 00:32:04,151
Shh!

579
00:32:05,742 --> 00:32:07,468
It's crack. Or crank, maybe.

580
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,468
- They were drug dealers?
- Yeah.

581
00:32:09,492 --> 00:32:10,760
They were probably thinking

582
00:32:10,784 --> 00:32:12,176
they were being tailed
by the cops.

583
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,859
Honey, your parole.

584
00:32:16,742 --> 00:32:18,734
Happy? Come on.

585
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:29,176
I have never seen
that much money before.

586
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,176
There's gotta be 10, 12 grand.

587
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,676
Look at this.

588
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,775
You're doubly blessed.

589
00:32:36,492 --> 00:32:39,734
You're right. Kim, and now this.

590
00:32:40,575 --> 00:32:42,942
I am gonna buy you a ring.

591
00:32:44,076 --> 00:32:47,151
You are the sweetest,
sweetest man.

592
00:32:48,492 --> 00:32:50,426
But you should put it
into the business.

593
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,551
See, I gotta start
thinking like that.

594
00:32:53,575 --> 00:32:55,400
It's a learning curve.

595
00:32:59,242 --> 00:33:02,927
Well, it seems to say here
that this Piggy represents

596
00:33:02,951 --> 00:33:04,593
intellectualism
over the physical.

597
00:33:04,617 --> 00:33:07,843
So maybe the eyeglasses
are symbolic.

598
00:33:07,867 --> 00:33:10,927
And that's a good topic
for section two in your outline.

599
00:33:10,951 --> 00:33:13,426
A.J., wake up!

600
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,843
I'm not gonna do this by myself.

601
00:33:15,867 --> 00:33:17,301
How are you gonna
finish this paper?

602
00:33:17,325 --> 00:33:19,525
It's not gonna write itself.

603
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:26,968
So now this so-called bag.

604
00:33:26,992 --> 00:33:28,900
You sure it wasn't
on some old lady's arm?

605
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,301
I can't believe
she thought it was a baby.

606
00:33:32,325 --> 00:33:33,927
People do that shit.

607
00:33:33,951 --> 00:33:35,510
Twelve grand?
<i>Madonna mi.</i>

608
00:33:35,534 --> 00:33:38,218
How many guys you gotta jerk off
on a massage table to make that?

609
00:33:38,242 --> 00:33:41,000
I don't know, what do you
charge without the table?

610
00:33:43,367 --> 00:33:44,635
Cristal, gentlemen?

611
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:47,010
Keep it coming, honey.

612
00:33:47,034 --> 00:33:49,154
From now on, anytime somebody
steps in a pile of shit,

613
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:51,135
it'll be known as a Blundetto.

614
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:54,109
To the Blundetto!

615
00:34:03,617 --> 00:34:04,942
Oh...

616
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,859
I wasn't ready.

What are you doing here?

625
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,609
Jesus. Nice greeting.

626
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,650
How are you? Everything okay?

627
00:34:42,992 --> 00:34:44,426
A.J. left this in his room.

628
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,442
Thought he might
need it to turn in.

629
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:51,817
Did you even look at this?
Who the hell is Anne Dunham?

630
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,094
How the hell should I know?

631
00:34:55,118 --> 00:34:57,676
Well, she's obviously
some girl who was an expert

632
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,426
on Lord of the Flies
three years ago.

633
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,318
This is an "A" -plus paper.

634
00:35:05,034 --> 00:35:06,984
Since when do you eat duck?

635
00:35:08,118 --> 00:35:09,676
I can't believe
he would do this.

636
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,783
Neither can I, considering
how tight he is with money.

637
00:35:11,784 --> 00:35:14,609
That's not what I meant. What?
Oh, you think he bought this?

638
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,734
Goddamn it.

639
00:35:21,034 --> 00:35:22,259
Hello?

640
00:35:22,283 --> 00:35:25,259
Hi, I was just laying
here thinking about you.

641
00:35:25,283 --> 00:35:26,760
<i>What are you wearing?</i>

642
00:35:26,784 --> 00:35:28,551
Yes, hello, Mr. Wegler, hi.

643
00:35:28,575 --> 00:35:30,468
I'm afraid now
is not a good time.

644
00:35:30,492 --> 00:35:32,900
I'm serious. I wanna know.

645
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,843
Uh, well, yes, thank you very much.

646
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,468
I will make sure
that he brings it in.

647
00:35:37,492 --> 00:35:38,968
Okay, goodbye, Mr. Wegler.

648
00:35:38,992 --> 00:35:40,668
<i>I made reservations at that</i>

649
00:35:40,692 --> 00:35:42,760
crab place down by the shore.

650
00:35:42,784 --> 00:35:45,094
Dinner and a little
night swimming.

651
00:35:45,118 --> 00:35:47,276
Right, okay, thank you.

652
00:35:48,617 --> 00:35:50,259
What'd that fag want?

653
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:52,635
Jesus Christ, Tony,
everybody's a fag to you.

654
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:54,825
You know, maybe you're a fag.
You ever think about that?

655
00:35:54,826 --> 00:35:56,885
Can I help it if I know one
when I see one?

656
00:35:56,909 --> 00:35:59,259
Oh, really? What are the signs?
Education? Culture?

657
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:00,968
Sucking a guy's cock
usually tips me off.

658
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,432
How do you know
who sucks whose cock?

659
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:03,927
What, do you got
a little secret?

660
00:36:03,951 --> 00:36:06,802
And what do you care anyway
if somebody's gay?

661
00:36:06,826 --> 00:36:08,676
It must be some
big fear of yours,

662
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,259
or you wouldn't
talk about it so much.

663
00:36:10,283 --> 00:36:12,366
I forget now. What part of hell
did you say they go to?

664
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:15,676
Are they with the abortion
doctors or the child molesters?

665
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,176
That was a long time ago.

666
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,720
Now you're all
open-minded that you got

667
00:36:18,742 --> 00:36:21,468
a couple of friends
that are bologna smokers.

668
00:36:21,492 --> 00:36:24,010
- Right?
- What the fuck are you doing?

669
00:36:24,034 --> 00:36:25,442
Going for a swim.

670
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:31,151
What, you leave your goddamn
socks here? Your underpants?

671
00:36:32,325 --> 00:36:37,734
♪ A girl waits for me ♪

672
00:36:44,992 --> 00:36:48,094
Hey, that's some beautiful suit.

673
00:36:48,118 --> 00:36:50,843
I had to get it.
It went with the shoes.

674
00:36:50,867 --> 00:36:54,426
- Whose got those? Vito's guy?
- Vasily's, custom-made.

675
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,692
The only thing I ever found
in the street is my first wife.

676
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,094
Dealer has 20.

677
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:03,218
- Son of a bitch.
- Oh!

678
00:37:03,242 --> 00:37:05,718
I just took a beating at craps.
How you guys doing?

679
00:37:05,742 --> 00:37:08,483
Pocahontas here is scalping us.

680
00:37:21,492 --> 00:37:22,968
What's the matter?

681
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:26,135
Oh, just nothing.

682
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:27,718
I don't know.

683
00:37:27,742 --> 00:37:31,635
I just keep thinking about
A.J. and that girl's paper.

684
00:37:31,659 --> 00:37:34,692
Oh, it's a pretty common thing,
Carm, really.

685
00:37:35,909 --> 00:37:37,385
Honestly, you know,

686
00:37:37,409 --> 00:37:39,635
the important thing
is you took a stand.

687
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:42,802
A lot of parents just take it
in stride or even condone it.

688
00:37:42,826 --> 00:37:44,551
It's just the cheating,
you know.

689
00:37:44,575 --> 00:37:46,593
It's just not like him.
He's always done his work.

690
00:37:46,617 --> 00:37:49,426
Poorly, a lot of the time,
and late.

691
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,176
But he always did it.
He never cheated.

692
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,760
Well, wait.

693
00:37:52,784 --> 00:37:54,259
Didn't I read
somewhere in his record

694
00:37:54,283 --> 00:37:55,843
that he stole a test
at Verbum Dei?

695
00:37:55,867 --> 00:37:57,885
Oh, please, no,
that was just acting out.

696
00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:59,468
He was with a bad crowd.

697
00:37:59,492 --> 00:38:01,593
They were there to vandalize
the science lab,

698
00:38:01,617 --> 00:38:04,052
but it was locked,
so they stole some tests.

699
00:38:04,076 --> 00:38:06,176
Well, I was a late bloomer too.

700
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,843
Union College
took a chance on me

701
00:38:07,867 --> 00:38:09,468
because they saw
that I had potential,

702
00:38:09,492 --> 00:38:11,343
but I wasn't that mature.

703
00:38:11,367 --> 00:38:12,760
That's all this is.

704
00:38:12,784 --> 00:38:14,551
A.J.'s just fighting
to keep pace

705
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:16,635
with the kids
who seem further ahead.

706
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:18,135
You know, you ask me,

707
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:19,510
I think he was driven
to cheating.

708
00:38:19,534 --> 00:38:20,802
It's that Mr. Fiske.

709
00:38:20,826 --> 00:38:23,468
He is ridiculous
with the pressure.

710
00:38:23,492 --> 00:38:25,094
I mean, how hopeless
would you feel

711
00:38:25,118 --> 00:38:27,301
if you really worked on
something and still got a "D"?

712
00:38:27,325 --> 00:38:28,635
I have been there, Carm.

713
00:38:28,659 --> 00:38:30,817
You're worrying for nothing,
I promise.

714
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:41,259
I have thought about this
all day.

715
00:38:41,283 --> 00:38:44,400
You know, I almost called you
from the faculty parking lot.

716
00:38:53,118 --> 00:38:54,468
- Oh, Bob.
- What?

717
00:38:54,492 --> 00:38:56,109
Stop. Bob, I...

718
00:38:57,992 --> 00:38:59,802
What's the matter?

719
00:38:59,826 --> 00:39:01,593
I can't right now, I'm sorry.

720
00:39:01,617 --> 00:39:03,650
I'm too upset.

721
00:39:08,034 --> 00:39:10,135
Carmela, stay.

722
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:11,676
What are you doing?

723
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,885
What kind of mother am I?
I mean, look at us.

724
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:16,676
You realize under the laws of
the Church, I am still married?

725
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,010
The Church?

726
00:39:18,034 --> 00:39:20,551
I can't do this tonight.
I'm sorry.

727
00:39:20,575 --> 00:39:23,151
Jesus, Carmela, come on.

728
00:39:43,867 --> 00:39:46,676
<i>♪ Thrill me, thrill me ♪</i>

729
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:51,551
<i>♪ Walk me down the lane
Where shadows will be ♪</i>

730
00:39:51,575 --> 00:39:53,468
<i>♪ Will be ♪</i>

731
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:55,551
<i>♪ Hiding lovers
Just the same... ♪</i>

732
00:39:55,575 --> 00:39:56,885
Okay, thanks.

733
00:39:56,909 --> 00:39:58,510
It was a fucking blast.

734
00:39:58,534 --> 00:39:59,885
You sure you don't wanna eat?

735
00:39:59,909 --> 00:40:01,900
Steak and eggs up by Skyway's.

736
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:05,385
- Ah, I can't.
- Come on, shut the door.

737
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:08,525
I'm gonna mang', then hit
the sack for the next 14 hours.

738
00:40:32,617 --> 00:40:34,551
Hey. I thought once
they move you upstairs

739
00:40:34,575 --> 00:40:35,843
you get to leave early.

740
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:38,609
No such luck. Got a second?

741
00:40:39,992 --> 00:40:41,218
The Soprano kid.

742
00:40:41,242 --> 00:40:43,426
How's he doing?

743
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,718
Got his paper yet?

744
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:46,885
Well, the usual.

745
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:49,218
Solidly below average.

746
00:40:49,242 --> 00:40:51,301
So, what, a "C"?

747
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:54,718
Well, no, that's a little
generous for 10% insight,

748
00:40:54,742 --> 00:40:56,176
90% CliffNotes.

749
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,408
This is an important class, Tom.
Anything less than a "C"

750
00:40:58,409 --> 00:41:00,593
is gonna blow that kid out
at Arizona State.

751
00:41:00,617 --> 00:41:03,016
You think it's gonna make
that much of a difference?

752
00:41:03,917 --> 00:41:06,635
As Dean of College Admissions
and head of your department,

753
00:41:06,659 --> 00:41:08,094
I happen to know it's a fact.

754
00:41:08,118 --> 00:41:10,094
He's doing his best.

755
00:41:10,118 --> 00:41:12,301
Well, like my dad used to say,

756
00:41:12,325 --> 00:41:14,318
the world needs
ditch diggers, too.

757
00:41:15,992 --> 00:41:17,635
Let me ask you something.

758
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:18,950
How is floating
this kid a C-minus

759
00:41:18,951 --> 00:41:20,259
gonna fuck things up here?

760
00:41:20,283 --> 00:41:22,468
A.J. Soprano's
a spoiled lox, Bob.

761
00:41:22,492 --> 00:41:24,259
He'd be lucky to go
to a trade school.

762
00:41:24,283 --> 00:41:26,468
It's a D-plus.

763
00:41:26,492 --> 00:41:29,067
Tom, cut him a break.

764
00:41:39,575 --> 00:41:40,783
So, what does it mean to the kid

765
00:41:40,784 --> 00:41:42,385
who really breaks his ass
in here

766
00:41:42,409 --> 00:41:45,343
if Fredo Corleone can
get a "C" 'cuz you asked?

767
00:41:45,367 --> 00:41:48,359
Is that what this is about?
His background?

768
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,343
Good night.

769
00:41:55,367 --> 00:41:57,151
I'll be working
over at the place.

770
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,218
That's good dedication.

771
00:42:00,242 --> 00:42:01,775
Way to go.

772
00:42:04,909 --> 00:42:07,385
See, regular people
need a place to relax too.

773
00:42:07,409 --> 00:42:10,026
They can't just hop on a plane
to the Bahamas, right?

774
00:42:11,492 --> 00:42:13,692
Hey, guys, what do you
think of Daddy's business?

775
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,135
Jason, Justin,
I'm talking to you.

776
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:19,859
- I like it.
- Yeah, it's nice.

777
00:42:21,076 --> 00:42:22,783
Well, maybe someday
when this thing takes off,

778
00:42:22,784 --> 00:42:25,176
you guys can work here, like as
a summer job or something.

779
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,843
Would you like that?
Working with your old man?

780
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:29,426
Sure.

781
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:32,343
All right, put those away.

782
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:34,426
You gotta do your homework,
before I take you back,

783
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:35,927
or your mom's gonna kill me.

784
00:42:35,951 --> 00:42:38,968
Mom says we need helmets
to ride the scooters you got us.

785
00:42:38,992 --> 00:42:40,468
We'll stop at Sports Authority.

786
00:42:40,492 --> 00:42:42,010
Come on, do your homework.

787
00:42:42,034 --> 00:42:43,218
Where?

788
00:42:43,242 --> 00:42:44,718
I don't know.

789
00:42:44,742 --> 00:42:46,400
Here, on the floor over there.

790
00:43:16,617 --> 00:43:19,192
Hold it like this. Ready?

791
00:43:22,118 --> 00:43:23,802
That was fast.

792
00:43:23,826 --> 00:43:25,483
I took a shortcut.

793
00:43:36,992 --> 00:43:39,802
Did you ever think
of painting that ceiling?

794
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:42,010
Maybe.

795
00:43:42,034 --> 00:43:44,010
How about a glow-in-the-dark
solar system

796
00:43:44,034 --> 00:43:45,718
like I had in college?

797
00:43:45,742 --> 00:43:47,676
I was thinking blue, maybe.

798
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,301
You know, like when you stick
your hand in the Caribbean.

799
00:43:50,325 --> 00:43:52,276
Oh, yeah.

800
00:43:54,742 --> 00:43:58,218
You think Union College
is a good place of A.J.?

801
00:43:58,242 --> 00:44:00,609
I don't know. Could be.

802
00:44:01,575 --> 00:44:02,935
You know,
maybe you could tell them

803
00:44:02,951 --> 00:44:04,551
how he's a lot like you were

804
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:06,468
when you were his age.

805
00:44:06,492 --> 00:44:08,109
That's a thought.

806
00:44:09,325 --> 00:44:11,676
So, have you ever been
to the Caribbean?

807
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,760
Yeah, Barbados, once. Years ago.

808
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:15,218
Oh, it was beautiful.

809
00:44:15,242 --> 00:44:17,135
Yeah, it is.

810
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:21,301
Maybe you could bring up
the fact that he has A.D.D.,

811
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,094
because it's not
the stigma it once was.

812
00:44:24,118 --> 00:44:26,468
That's true.

813
00:44:26,492 --> 00:44:28,468
It isn't.

814
00:44:28,492 --> 00:44:30,276
Where you going?

815
00:44:44,534 --> 00:44:46,052
Mmm.

816
00:44:46,076 --> 00:44:47,885
Faculty lunch, right?

817
00:44:47,909 --> 00:44:50,359
Patty D'Amico brought them.

818
00:44:57,159 --> 00:44:58,734
What's the matter? You okay?

819
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:01,609
Maybe we should take a time-out.

820
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:04,426
What?

821
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:05,817
Really? Why?

822
00:45:07,325 --> 00:45:09,802
Because every time I think about
putting the arm on Tom Fiske,

823
00:45:09,826 --> 00:45:12,176
I wanna poke my eyes out
with a knitting needle.

824
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,400
What does that have
to do with us?

825
00:45:15,784 --> 00:45:17,942
I just think we should, uh...

826
00:45:19,992 --> 00:45:21,593
not do this.

827
00:45:21,617 --> 00:45:23,885
Oh. Oh, no.

828
00:45:23,909 --> 00:45:25,525
Here, tell me.

829
00:45:26,909 --> 00:45:28,942
I don't know any
other way to put this.

830
00:45:29,909 --> 00:45:31,483
I have been thinking, and...

831
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:34,052
I don't know, I...

832
00:45:34,076 --> 00:45:36,301
I think you're a user, Carmela.

833
00:45:36,325 --> 00:45:38,010
What?

834
00:45:38,034 --> 00:45:40,343
Maybe you saw
an opportunity in me,

835
00:45:40,367 --> 00:45:42,676
and you just took
what you needed.

836
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,176
Oh, that is not true.

837
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,968
I am here because
I enjoy being with you.

838
00:45:46,992 --> 00:45:48,426
It was wonderful, in fact.

839
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:51,676
Yeah, it was.
I mean, it is, I know.

840
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,593
How could asking someone you're
with for help be using them?

841
00:45:54,617 --> 00:45:56,151
That's what people do.

842
00:46:02,242 --> 00:46:03,692
Bob, this hurts.

843
00:46:07,283 --> 00:46:08,692
Oh, my.

844
00:46:09,534 --> 00:46:11,094
Oh, my stomach. I feel sick.

845
00:46:11,118 --> 00:46:13,135
You strong-armed me using
the only weapon you have:

846
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:14,343
your pussy.

847
00:46:14,367 --> 00:46:17,218
How dare you
talk to me that way?

848
00:46:17,242 --> 00:46:19,760
Okay, let's pretend you don't
know what I'm talking about.

849
00:46:19,784 --> 00:46:21,301
I don't.

850
00:46:21,325 --> 00:46:23,282
Of course, I don't have
a fucking master's degree.

851
00:46:23,283 --> 00:46:25,158
Leaving me with a massive
hard-on the other night

852
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:26,885
and then practically
attacking me sexually

853
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,359
after you got what you wanted.

854
00:46:29,909 --> 00:46:32,802
You know what, Bob?
You are fucked up.

855
00:46:32,826 --> 00:46:35,052
You need help, you know that?

856
00:46:35,076 --> 00:46:37,151
Fucking idiot I am.

857
00:46:39,242 --> 00:46:40,885
Take it easy.

858
00:46:40,909 --> 00:46:43,094
Believe it or not,
I thought you cared about me.

859
00:46:43,118 --> 00:46:45,094
I just thought you
should know how I feel.

860
00:46:45,118 --> 00:46:47,109
Fuck you!

861
00:46:48,034 --> 00:46:49,483
You better watch your step.

862
00:46:56,492 --> 00:46:57,968
Jesus Christ, it's 4:00 a.m.

863
00:46:57,992 --> 00:46:59,692
Okay, boys, hands on the table.

864
00:47:01,784 --> 00:47:03,650
Full boat.

865
00:47:04,492 --> 00:47:06,468
Jesus Christ.

866
00:47:06,492 --> 00:47:08,218
Three fucking jacks over here.

867
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,968
You just keep jacking,
my friend.

868
00:47:09,992 --> 00:47:11,760
That's it for me, tapioca.

869
00:47:11,784 --> 00:47:13,525
You blew the whole 12 grand?

870
00:47:14,784 --> 00:47:16,609
What are you stupid?
I got 400 left.

871
00:47:20,534 --> 00:47:22,400
Punch in in two hours.

872
00:47:25,534 --> 00:47:27,192
There's no sense going home.

873
00:47:36,118 --> 00:47:37,483
Fuck.

874
00:48:04,617 --> 00:48:05,760
Hello?

875
00:48:05,784 --> 00:48:07,385
Hey, hon,
I'm over at your mom's.

876
00:48:07,409 --> 00:48:08,885
<i>- Great.</i>
- Roadway Xpress

877
00:48:08,909 --> 00:48:10,510
delivered five massage tables.

878
00:48:10,534 --> 00:48:13,010
There? They had that address
by mistake.

879
00:48:13,034 --> 00:48:14,593
I told them to deliver here.

880
00:48:14,617 --> 00:48:16,176
They're still in the boxes.

881
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,551
I looked inside, though.
They're pretty spiff.

882
00:48:18,575 --> 00:48:20,718
That Salamanca fabric
was worth it.

883
00:48:20,742 --> 00:48:22,176
<i>It's like leather, almost.</i>

884
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,343
Great.

885
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:24,843
What's the matter?

886
00:48:24,867 --> 00:48:26,426
This shit gives me a headache.

887
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:28,259
Details and all that stuff.

888
00:48:28,283 --> 00:48:30,388
Oh, you, it's no big,
for gosh sake,

889
00:48:30,412 --> 00:48:32,885
<i>- we'll get Rudy's truck.</i>
- Maybe I have a brain tumor.

890
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:34,301
Honey, you don't.

891
00:48:34,325 --> 00:48:36,010
<i>This headache in my jaw.</i>

892
00:48:36,034 --> 00:48:37,510
<i>I read it in Time magazine.</i>

893
00:48:37,534 --> 00:48:39,218
<i>It's really not that likely, jeez.</i>

894
00:48:39,242 --> 00:48:40,802
I gotta get back
to the painting,

895
00:48:40,826 --> 00:48:42,802
or I'll never get the fuck
out of here tonight.

896
00:48:42,826 --> 00:48:45,885
I am so fucking sick and tired

897
00:48:45,909 --> 00:48:47,343
of your gambling and complaining.

898
00:48:47,367 --> 00:48:48,593
I've got a headache.

899
00:48:48,617 --> 00:48:50,259
<i>When I think of me</i>

900
00:48:50,283 --> 00:48:51,885
<i>waiting outside that
prison for you to come out</i>

901
00:48:51,909 --> 00:48:53,218
<i>sometimes I wanna vomit.</i>

902
00:48:53,242 --> 00:48:54,900
I am sick! I'm evil!

903
00:48:59,076 --> 00:49:01,885
Hey, Henry Ford.

904
00:49:01,909 --> 00:49:04,385
Big entrepreneur.

905
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:06,026
I like color.

906
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,301
My friend, Pak, come by?

907
00:49:16,325 --> 00:49:17,676
Fix the toilet?

908
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,052
It's not fixed.

909
00:49:19,076 --> 00:49:20,676
He's gotta come back
with a fucking part.

910
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,426
Oh. Pak, he good plumber.

911
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:26,218
Right over here,
"Wes-a Calwell".

912
00:49:26,242 --> 00:49:28,817
"Wes Calwel, Wes Calwel."

913
00:49:30,659 --> 00:49:33,318
West Caldwell.

914
00:49:35,492 --> 00:49:40,234
So, partner,
we open in three day, huh?

915
00:49:44,118 --> 00:49:45,635
Fucking stroll in.

916
00:49:45,659 --> 00:49:47,510
I'm over here
busting my fucking ass!

917
00:49:47,534 --> 00:49:48,885
You fucking crazy?

918
00:49:48,909 --> 00:49:54,109
Work in your fucking laundry,
all fucking day!

919
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,468
Fucking scam artist.

920
00:49:58,492 --> 00:49:59,968
Hyah!

921
00:49:59,992 --> 00:50:01,359
Fuck.

922
00:50:14,867 --> 00:50:16,692
Ah!

923
00:50:18,867 --> 00:50:20,525
Fuck!

924
00:50:39,242 --> 00:50:41,094
The pole is bent.

925
00:50:41,118 --> 00:50:43,609
Somebody been
punching this door?

926
00:50:45,325 --> 00:50:48,151
You had a man around,
you wouldn't need to call me.

927
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:50,650
Yeah, right.

928
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:53,635
You're still young, Mel.

929
00:50:53,659 --> 00:50:55,385
A good-looking woman.

930
00:50:55,409 --> 00:50:57,968
There's no reason you shouldn't
move on with your life,

931
00:50:57,992 --> 00:51:00,026
if that's what you want.

932
00:51:06,784 --> 00:51:09,276
Well, there actually
was somebody.

933
00:51:12,575 --> 00:51:16,109
- And he seemed very nice.
- Oh, that's good.

934
00:51:17,617 --> 00:51:20,192
He was a wolf
in sheep's clothing.

935
00:51:21,534 --> 00:51:24,650
He made all these accusations
about my character.

936
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:29,760
Whatever I say, whatever I do,

937
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:32,760
because I was married
to a man like Tony,

938
00:51:32,784 --> 00:51:36,359
my motives will always
be called into question.

939
00:51:45,951 --> 00:51:47,400
Well...

940
00:52:06,909 --> 00:52:09,567
Hey. Sit down.

941
00:52:10,575 --> 00:52:12,026
You want something?

942
00:52:15,659 --> 00:52:17,067
What'd you do?

943
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:20,052
Back. Fucking job.

944
00:52:20,076 --> 00:52:22,026
A work-related injury.

945
00:52:29,909 --> 00:52:31,885
So, here's the thing.

946
00:52:31,909 --> 00:52:33,843
You mentioned you might
need someone

947
00:52:33,867 --> 00:52:35,483
to run the swag airbags.

948
00:52:48,283 --> 00:52:50,927
Bring me a vodka rocks,

949
00:52:50,951 --> 00:52:53,192
and get me some kind
of a cushion, will you?

950
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:58,234
What happened with
the massage parlor?

951
00:53:06,034 --> 00:53:09,234

with strangers.
