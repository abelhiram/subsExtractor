There he is.
Black Jack Massarone.

35
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:20,167
I saw this,
and I thought of you.

36
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:25,709
- Ho! Look at that.
- Guy's local.

37
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:29,126
He makes them as part
of a program for disabled vets.

38
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,584
A little gift to show my
gratitude for all our work together.

39
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,834
Thanks.

40
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:44,500
- Look at those guys, huh?
- Mmm.

41
00:02:44,584 --> 00:02:46,876
They had some times, huh?

42
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:51,626
You know, we're finally gonna cut
the ribbon for the museum on the 22nd.

43
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:53,429
They're gonna ask me
to make a little speech

44
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,125
on the challenges of
contemporary urban development.

45
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,500
Thank you.

46
00:02:59,584 --> 00:03:01,000
Somethin' for you?

47
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:04,417
Oh, I'll have what he's having.

48
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:10,417
Listen, my buddy
in city plan check says they

49
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,500
just pulled a permit to turn the
old bus station into a mixed use.

50
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:16,709
The thing is, Zellman still
hasn't given me a number.

51
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:19,334
Has he said anything
to you about another bid?

52
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:24,167
Oh, we don't talk much.
Take your hat off. Relax.

53
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,334
Yeah, I just started
on the Rogaine.

54
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,417
Listen, you think
maybe you could ask Ron

55
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,792
if this falls
under the same arrangement?

56
00:03:34,876 --> 00:03:38,000
Kinda soggy,
you wanna know the truth.

57
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,918
Tony, this
is federal redevelopment.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,792
I'll look into it.

59
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,751
- So, a speech, huh?
- Yeah.

60
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:51,834
At the Museum of
Science and Truckin'.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I just wish my mother
could've seen it.

62
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:58,876
Well, wherever she is,
I'm sure she's proud.

63
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,751
Actually, I think I know
exactly where she is,

64
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:03,792
and it's pretty fuckin' hot.

65
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,000
You had one of those, too, huh?

66
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:13,417
Gentlemen.
Is everything okay here?

67
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,876
Yeah, sure. Just talkin'.

68
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,042
Okay, then.

69
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,584
Have a good night.

70
00:04:31,876 --> 00:04:34,876
So they go through labor.
Big deal. Try a prostate exam.

71
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:40,209
This is great.

72
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:43,500
And I-I usually
don't like modern art.

73
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:47,876
The Rat Pack.

74
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:52,459
Do you know
a Joseph "Joey" Cogo?

75
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,959
Not much. I mean, I met him...

76
00:04:58,584 --> 00:05:00,250
last week.

77
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:03,876
Me and Chrissy were havin' dinner
with Tony and his friend Valentina.

78
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:06,209
Joey Cogo sent over
a bottle of Veuve.

79
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:07,876
Wanna show her those?

80
00:05:13,584 --> 00:05:15,042
Oh, my God.

81
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,125
Was this man with him?

82
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:26,000
Yeah. I saw him.

83
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,918
- You're sure?
- Tuesday night.

84
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,209
Jesus, 'cause of what I said?

85
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:50,751
<i>You're supposed to be earners.</i>

86
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:53,083
<i>That's wh...
the top tier positions.</i>

87
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,166
<i>So each one of you go out
to your people on the street,</i>

88
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:56,584
<i>crack some fuckin'...</i>

89
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,500
<i>Create some fuckin'
earners out there!</i>

90
00:05:58,584 --> 00:06:02,000
- So, what's he sayin'?
- The way I remember he said,

91
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:05,876
"That's why you got
the top tier positions."

92
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:11,292
This other inaudible is
"Crack fuckin' heads," not legs.

93
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:14,250
I need a signature.

94
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:23,000
<i>Now, that's it.
That's all I gotta say.</i>

95
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,626
<i>Frankly, I'm depressed and...</i>

96
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:29,209
- Depressed and what?
- "Depressed and ashamed."

97
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:33,125
So what about my Alan Stewart
shirt from that meeting?

98
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:36,542
Ralph Cifaretto spilt
my coffee and ruined it.

99
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:39,459
I can petty cash it.
Resubmit, okay?

100
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:48,459
This Crazy Horse pole
camera's working out really good.

101
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:52,167
Paulie Gualtieri's car again.
She's still lying.

102
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,250
<i>Listen, any chance
you could ask Ron</i>

103
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:01,584
<i>if this falls under
the same arrangement?</i>

104
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:04,500
<i>It's kinda soggy,
you wanna know the truth.</i>

105
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:06,000
Pie. He was eating.

106
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,667
<i>Tony, this is
federal redevelopment.</i>

107
00:07:07,751 --> 00:07:09,667
<i>I'll look into it.</i>

108
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,751
<i>- So, a speech, huh?</i>
- The sound quality is amazing.

109
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:17,667
New hats.
Mic's right in the button.

110
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:19,500
<i>...Museum of
Science and Truckin'.</i>

111
00:07:19,584 --> 00:07:21,500
<i>I just wish my
mother could've seen it.</i>

112
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:23,334
Give it to Angela
and shut the door.

113
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:25,626
<i>Wherever she is,
I'm sure she's proud.</i>

114
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:29,000
What happened to the jury tampering
investigation on Junior Soprano's trial?

115
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:32,209
<i>- Actually, I...</i>
- You guys just drop the ball on that?

116
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:34,562
Massarone's a huge
asset. Couple him with...

117
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:35,334
What?

118
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:37,584
Three-year-old airline tickets?

119
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:39,459
Some ties
to the Bevelaqua murder?

120
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:44,209
Even if Massarone and a
thousand other snitches pan out,

121
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:46,584
we've still gotta
put Tony on trial.

122
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,834
That's useless
until we find out how they

123
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:51,083
penetrated
the anonymous jury system.

124
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:53,042
And what? Jury duty's
not tough enough?

125
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,042
You know we don't like
to dig into some citizen.

126
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:59,292
Tough shit. One of those
citizens is a felon. Get on it.

127
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:06,834
You know what's
goin' on here, right?

128
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:10,167
He fucked up his six-figure
future with O'Melveny and Meyers

129
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,709
when he blew
the Junior Soprano trial.

130
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:16,918
Of course he'll keep tryin' him
until he fixes that.

131
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:21,167
- Hey!
- Hey.

132
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,042
There he is, John Barrymore.

133
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:27,876
- How are ya?
- All right.

134
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,751
I thought nobody ever
comes to see you.

135
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:34,667
I was droppin' off
some dandelions.

136
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:38,083
Saw a beautiful patch in a
vacant lot over by 15th Street.

137
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:40,709
- Nice salad.
- Any word about Tony B?

138
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:42,250
Yeah, yeah,
should be any day now.

139
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:44,918
Aunt Quintina's gonna call
the moment she hears.

140
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,542
He's a good kid,
your cousin, huh? Smart.

141
00:08:48,626 --> 00:08:51,000
Fuckin' weirdo, you ask me.

142
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,375
All right, the vacant lot
over on 15th Street?

143
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:57,542
That's where all the
neighborhood dogs go to piss.

144
00:08:59,726 --> 00:09:01,675
You goddamn clown.

145
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,792
You got anything
lined up for the kid?

146
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:08,626
Yeah, yeah, air bags.
We pull 'em from boosted cars.

147
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:10,959
People buy 'em like you
wouldn't fuckin' believe.

148
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:13,334
Hey, legit dealers, body shops,

149
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:15,792
they reinstall
undeployed bags as new.

150
00:09:15,876 --> 00:09:18,825
- Top dollar.
- Brave new world. Jesus Christ,

151
00:09:18,909 --> 00:09:22,250
they didn't even have
shoulder belts when I went away.

152
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:24,292
So you'll let me know
when the kid gets out, huh?

153
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,792
Yeah, we'll have
a party for him.

154
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:28,384
- All right.
- I love you, okay.

155
00:09:39,334 --> 00:09:42,167
Come on, eat.
Don't be so sensitive.

156
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,042
I was bein' polite. It's like...

157
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,167
It's like eatin' red fescue.
I'll take an egg.

158
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,584
You want an egg?
Bobby, make my nephew an egg.

159
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:50,334
I don't want an egg.

160
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:55,584
Tony B.

161
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:58,334
Like a welcome home present.

162
00:09:58,417 --> 00:10:01,500
- What's that, a Motorola?
- Yeah.

163
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:02,709
Supposed to be the best.

164
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:05,000
You know,
I figured he could use one.

165
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,500
Call me when he needs me.

166
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:10,042
All the fellas are
gettin' out, huh?

167
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:14,083
The class of 2004.
Old rats on a new ship.

168
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,876
I think I'll take an egg.
Make us a couple eggs.

169
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,959
I'm doin' it. You told me.

170
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,292
He don't want one.

171
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:26,125
You and Tony Egg again.

172
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,083
Tony Egg? Tony B.

173
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:30,607
Like the time you two, you took
that camera in the bathroom...

174
00:10:30,626 --> 00:10:34,000
...at your sister
Barbara's confirmation.

175
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,459
Hello?

176
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,167
Oh, that's terrible.

177
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:46,375
Where's he gonna be laid out?

178
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:49,834
Who now, goddamn it!

179
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:51,792
Well, let us know.

180
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:55,209
Carmine Lupertazzi.

181
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:57,500
He passed during the night.

182
00:10:57,584 --> 00:11:00,375
What a fuckin' blow.

183
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,334
He was a great man.

184
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:06,417
My cousin told me it was Carmine
who invented point shaving.

185
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,334
CCNY versus Kentucky, 1951.

186
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:14,500
Nobody beat the spread.
I bought a black Fleetwood.

187
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,417
Anthony.

188
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,416
Anthony, did I ever tell you
I want to be cremated?

189
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:24,751
About four times.

190
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:27,083
And don't throw my ashes
in somebody's yard

191
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:28,584
or off some fuckin' bridge.

192
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:31,375
I wanna be on the mantelpiece
surrounded by family.

193
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:33,959
Yeah, under
the moose head, I know.

194
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:36,667
Keep jokin'.
Let me tell ya somethin'.

195
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:40,042
It's like that game
we used to play as kids,

196
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,709
crack the whip.

197
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:43,750
You run around like an idiot
holdin' hands as tight as you can,

198
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:46,959
and then the line snaps,
somebody lets go...

199
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,709
and you're next.

200
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:04,542
Your father meant
a lot to all of us.

201
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:07,792
And not just financially either.

202
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:09,918
How are ya?

203
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What's up, buddy?

204
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:19,918
Nicole,
you remember Mr. Petrille?

205
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,292
What, honey?

206
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:26,042
He meant a lot to us.

207
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,792
- Ginny.
- Phil, how ya doin'?

208
00:12:27,876 --> 00:12:31,209
- Hey, kid. I'm heartbroken.
- Angelo.

209
00:12:33,751 --> 00:12:35,667
Nicole, you remember Mr. Garepe.

210
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:36,792
Of course.

211
00:12:37,876 --> 00:12:39,500
That was my aunt.

212
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:42,792
- My cousin's out.
- Aw, that's great news.

213
00:12:42,876 --> 00:12:44,834
Start him off small, T.

214
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:47,417
You hear that?
Your cousin's out.

215
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,459
- Oh, look who's comin'.
- What?

216
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,125
- Hey there, handsome.
- Hey, baby.

217
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,083
- How are ya?
- Good.

218
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:00,250
Lorraine, you're lookin' good.

219
00:13:00,334 --> 00:13:02,792
Yeah, keepin' it together
with Pilates and gin.

220
00:13:02,876 --> 00:13:04,626
Sil, Paulie, how's it hangin'?

221
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:06,334
Still got the nice manners, huh?

222
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:10,334
Ah, this is my
nephew Christopher.

223
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:13,459
Lady Shylock,
you got some reputation.

224
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,876
Yeah, my mother
said that might happen.

225
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,167
I'd like to introduce you
to the love of my life.

226
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,000
This is my partner,
Jason Evanina.

227
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:23,209
- Honor to meet ya.
- Hey, how are ya?

228
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:27,834
So Jesus leans off the cross
and whispers to Peter,

229
00:13:27,918 --> 00:13:30,125
"I can see your house
from here."

230
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:38,667
I'm so sorry.
This was such a shock.

231
00:13:42,626 --> 00:13:43,876
This is a very hard day.

232
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:46,876
I just saw Ginny.
The flowers are beautiful.

233
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,292
- John, got a minute?
- Yeah.

234
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,292
Nicole, I'm sorry.

235
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,125
What's goin' on here?

236
00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:59,751
- What are you talkin' about?
- My father.

237
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:02,375
- Look at his hands.
- He looks peaceful.

238
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:06,167
I'm talkin' about his rosary.
The medal?

239
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,250
You think I don't
know what that is?

240
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:09,667
It's for Opus Dei.

241
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:11,167
The fuck is that about?

242
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,250
In his later years,
your father was very sensitive

243
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:16,250
- about what's been goin' on in the church.
- Bullshit!

244
00:14:16,334 --> 00:14:18,125
Your wife is into Opus Dei.

245
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:20,209
You told Colombino
to put it there.

246
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,124
- You sure about that?
- Yes, John, I'm sure.

247
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,250
Body's not even cold.

248
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:26,417
No respect for anything anymore.

249
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,125
And New Jersey housewife
fundamentalist shit?

250
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:31,959
- I doubt it, John.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

251
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:34,876
You yourself said
I was like another son to him.

252
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,792
I was bein'
polite. It was his deathbed.

253
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:39,751
I should've
written those words down.

254
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:41,434
Maybe you should have, John,

255
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,125
'cause they don't mean
anything anymore.

256
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:45,667
You understand what I'm sayin'?

257
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:52,918
<i>I saw a huge</i>

258
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,667
mushroom cloud from the shell.

259
00:14:58,751 --> 00:15:03,167
<i>Jim Campbell might
be alive today</i>

260
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,000
<i>if he hadn't said to me,</i>

261
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:11,292
<i>"Heffron, you stay
here with your gun.</i>

262
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,834
<i>I'm going up."</i>

263
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:18,918
<i>All your life,</i>

264
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:21,042
<i>you gotta remember
what one guy did</i>

265
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,042
<i>because he thought it
was his job to do,</i>

266
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,250
<i>and he took a shot for you.</i>

267
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:37,834
This shit's not supposed to run,
and here I look like a raccoon.

268
00:15:37,918 --> 00:15:40,959
You are irresistible
and you know it.

269
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:44,167
- Danny said I was clingy.
- Fuck him.

270
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,042
He's the one with
the self-esteem issues.

271
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,125
You don't know what
it's like out there, Ade.

272
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:49,626
You're marrying Christopher.

273
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:53,500
He's handsome, makes money,
he's got great hair.

274
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:57,626
Oh...

275
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:00,083
Okay.

276
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:03,834
You know I love animals,
but this thing is so gorgeous.

277
00:16:03,918 --> 00:16:06,292
Isn't it?
My dad almost had a stroke.

278
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,584
But I told him, "Hey, asshole,

279
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,709
I'm the one taking all
the fucking risk here.

280
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:13,584
I have to fake the invoices."

281
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:17,209
Sometimes you gotta just take
care of yourself, you know?

282
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:18,984
Sure you do, honey.

283
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:21,600
Come here.

284
00:16:21,683 --> 00:16:24,267
- Mmm.
- Oh!

285
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,334
Come on. Let's don't
keep your date waiting.

286
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:29,500
He likes you, I can tell.

287
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:37,334
We got a white wine for Ade.

288
00:16:37,417 --> 00:16:42,250
- That's another apple martini for you.
- Thank you, my dear.

289
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:46,083
My Seven-and-7,
and nothing-and-nothing.

290
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:49,125
Don't listen to him, Chrissy.

291
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,525
I think what
you're doing's brave.

292
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:53,417
It's not for everybody.

293
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,417
Things are different when you
don't have that crutch, you know?

294
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,751
We make up for it other ways.

295
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,209
My God, it's hot in here.

296
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:04,542
What do you expect?
You're dancing in a mink coat.

297
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:08,967
- It's fox.
- She's my fox in a box.

298
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:12,834
Let's see her box,
or maybe her socks.

299
00:17:13,718 --> 00:17:15,667
Stupid.

300
00:17:15,751 --> 00:17:18,125
Well, I have to wear fur
on the outside

301
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:21,083
on account of being
bare everywhere else.

302
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:23,918
- You believe this one?
- No shit.

303
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:34,959
Every place I go, I got substances
I can't enjoy shoved in my face.

304
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:38,667
But I guess asking you for a little
support system in my own home

305
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:40,292
is way the fuck outta line.

306
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,292
You gotta have some more wine.

307
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,125
Seemed to have
a good time tonight.

308
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:47,500
The fuck you talking about?
What, Tina?

309
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:51,542
Come on, that cunt's too
full of herself, anyway.

310
00:17:51,626 --> 00:17:54,167
Cunt? She's my maid of honor,
Christopher.

311
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,626
She's no fucking maid,
let me tell you.

312
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:04,751
Great, now I'm upset.
See what I'm talking about?

313
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,209
But I guess it's all my problem.

314
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:14,834
I'm sorry, baby. Okay?

315
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:19,250
Please, stop.

316
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:25,000
All right, all right.
My handsome nephew.

317
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,000
Auntie Quin, look at you
all dolled up, huh?

318
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:32,334
Ah! I never thought I'd
live to see this day.

319
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:34,292
Well, here ya are, still here.

320
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,500
Where's Tony?

321
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:38,125
Downstairs getting
into one of his old suits.

322
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:40,834
- I'll buy him some new suits.
- He's fine.

323
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:44,375
I only wish he had more
to come back to.

324
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:46,834
That ex-wife of his,

325
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:50,834
she uses her answering machine
to ignore me,

326
00:18:50,918 --> 00:18:53,459
so forget about
his seeing the twins.

327
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:58,459
How's Kelly? How's she doing?

328
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,292
She's lost to us, Anthony.

329
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:05,209
But Tony says
he's gonna hire a detective.

330
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:08,959
Look at this.
The two of you were so cute.

331
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:12,959
Even then,
my cannoli was bigger than his.

332
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:14,417
Ooh, stop.

333
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,125
Aw, man. There he is.

334
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:24,876
Ah.

335
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:32,125
Oh! God, Ton'.

336
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:34,500
Look at us, 15 fuckin' years.

337
00:19:34,584 --> 00:19:37,751
- The language.
- Go ahead, say it.

338
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:40,250
I haven't changed a bit, right?

339
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:44,626
You look good, you look good.

340
00:19:44,709 --> 00:19:45,724
Oh!

341
00:19:46,648 --> 00:19:48,917
Say "provolone."

342
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:53,209
Surprise!

343
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:58,125
Shit. Very nice,
you give me a heart attack.

344
00:19:58,209 --> 00:20:00,542
Ma, it's enough, all right?
Stop crying.

345
00:20:00,626 --> 00:20:02,500
I'm embarrassed enough.

346
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:06,250
I don't know what to say.

347
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:08,083
Don't say anything. Just eat.

348
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:09,405
Oh, hey!

349
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:13,167
Ha! I got peppers been
marinating for 15 years!

350
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,751
Hey.

351
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:19,959
- What?
- Where's Tubs?

352
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:22,000
Artie? What happened here?

353
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,459
Still a ball-breaker, huh?

354
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:26,584
Boop!

355
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:33,595
The fuck's with him?

356
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,375
Ask him.

357
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:37,751
You guys have a beef?

358
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:40,626
I loaned the guy some money,
then he tried to kill himself.

359
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:42,751
And guess who got the blame?

360
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:46,709
Oh, my God, Tony.! Oh!

361
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:49,584
My God, we have
all missed you so much.

362
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:51,876
I swear, you...
you look exactly the same.

363
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,667
Oh, you're still
full of shit, huh?

364
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:57,125
Is Nancy here yet? The twins?

365
00:20:57,209 --> 00:20:59,167
No, Nancy couldn't make it.

366
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,250
Her aunt in Bayonne,
the sciatica.

367
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:11,751
- What are you gonna do?
- Cousin!

368
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:14,000
Jan! Oh!

369
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,792
Come, come, I want you
to meet my family.

370
00:21:15,876 --> 00:21:17,459
I'm talking to him right now.

371
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,792
- Tony, you remember Bobby.
- Oh, yeah.

372
00:21:19,876 --> 00:21:21,834
Now my husband.

373
00:21:21,918 --> 00:21:24,918
And guys, this is
your Uncle Tony Blundetto.

374
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,334
Hey, there.

375
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:29,000
How come we
never met you before?

376
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:32,167
I've been away on business.

377
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,918
I've never even heard of you.

378
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:38,334
Stop playing with your ice,
come on.

379
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,709
They let that kid say anything.

380
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:47,042
- Welcome home, Uncle Tony.
- Oh, Jesus.

381
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,375
This is Meadow.

382
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,375
God, you turned out
beautiful, honey.

383
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:56,167
And this strapping young man
is Anthony Jr.

384
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,542
How's Kelly?

385
00:21:58,626 --> 00:22:02,137
Our regular dinner,
out by you Thursday, right?

386
00:22:02,161 --> 00:22:03,375
Yes, Daddy.

387
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:06,667
See, with my family now,
you know, the separation,

388
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:10,000
you gotta make an appointment
to see each other.

389
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:16,459
- I should go see Uncle Zio.
- Yeah.

390
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:18,417
- All right.
- Show him the phone!

391
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,959
Yeah.

392
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:50,334
Tony.

393
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:53,083
I'll make this fast
'cause I know you're all hungry.

394
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,375
I remember growing up,

395
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:01,918
I was always asking why
I just used to have sisters.

396
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,918
I said to my mother, I said, "Can't you save
up something and then get me a baby brother?"

397
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,125
And my mother said,

398
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,959
"What's wrong
with your cousin Tony?"

399
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:15,709
And she was right,
'cause we were brothers.

400
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:19,292
Except, you know,
we had the same name.

401
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:22,209
There was, like, 50 Tonys
in the family.

402
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:25,083
Some of you remember this.

403
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:28,083
My dad's name was Johnny,

404
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:30,709
and his dad's name was Alfred.

405
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:34,375
And so whenever we were out
running around and we'd hear,

406
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:37,417
"Tony Uncle Johnny,"
that was for me.

407
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,792
And "Tony Uncle Al,"
that was for him.

408
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:43,000
And there was "Tony
Uncle Philly!" Remember?

409
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:47,167
- Right, yeah, yeah.
- But he passed away.

410
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,000
<i><i>Buon anima</i>.</i>

411
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,000
And Uncle Phil, Uncle Phil,

412
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,334
he passed away
a long time ago too.

413
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:57,209
So, anyway...

414
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:03,209
Tony's being away,
it's been hard.

415
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:08,292
But he's back now, for good.

416
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:17,584
- So welcome home.
- Welcome home.

417
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:20,292
- Thank you.
<i>- <i>Salute</i>.</i>

418
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,334
Come on, let me hear it.
Welcome home!

419
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:25,918
Welcome home!

420
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,959
Hey, Ton', Meadow is incredible.

421
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:31,792
She's a fucking Ivy Leaguer.
You and Carm hit a home run.

422
00:24:31,876 --> 00:24:33,334
Yeah.

423
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:36,042
I'm sure Kelly's all right,
wherever she is.

424
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,000
Hey, her old man was in prison.

425
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,876
We tried to do everything
we could.

426
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,917
I know. I mean, I wasn't
around. What could I expect?

427
00:24:41,918 --> 00:24:45,292
I mean, if things had gone
different way back when, who knows?

428
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:50,334
- What do you want from me?
- Nothing!

429
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:53,167
I'm just saying it's good
it wasn't both of us.

430
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:58,417
Ah, well, these things
happen, right?

431
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,500
You're gonna like
this place. This is nice.

432
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:06,250
This is the kind of place we
always talked about having.

433
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:13,250
Fucking weird.

434
00:25:13,334 --> 00:25:15,083
My cousin in the old man's seat.

435
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:16,751
It's like Sun Ti-zu says:

436
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:21,167
"A good commander is benevolent
and unconcerned with fame."

437
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,792
- What?
- Sun Ti-zu.

438
00:25:23,876 --> 00:25:25,709
The Chinese Prince Matchabelli.

439
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:27,876
Tony turned me on to him.

440
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,876
"Zoo"! "Zoo"!

441
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:32,918
Sun Tzu, you fucking ass-kiss.

442
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,834
- Hey.
- Feech!

443
00:25:36,918 --> 00:25:39,667
You know, I missed you
by two weeks at Allenwood.

444
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:53,292
This'll help you get started.

445
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:55,375
Jesus, you're
on your feet already?

446
00:25:55,459 --> 00:25:58,626
You hit the ground running,
and you don't look back, huh?

447
00:25:58,709 --> 00:26:00,167
Thank you.

448
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:02,626
Come on.

449
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:06,626
So you in
on the bus station project?

450
00:26:06,709 --> 00:26:08,626
Massarone's waiting on a number.

451
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:11,000
- How's he doing?
- Good.

452
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:15,584
We had coffee.
He used to bore me, Jack.

453
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:18,167
But he ain't a bad guy,
once you get to know him.

454
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,709
I always liked him.

455
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:27,584
I was very touched
by that funeral the other day.

456
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:30,792
- Real heart-grabber.
- That fucking little Carmine.

457
00:26:30,876 --> 00:26:32,209
And after what?

458
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:37,500
Five years in Florida
fixing wet t-shirt contests.

459
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:49,250
M'boy are you fat.

460
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:52,417
What did you say?

461
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,375
Reginald Van Gleason III.

462
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:58,709
"M'boy are you fat."

463
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:04,250
That's good, yeah.

464
00:27:04,334 --> 00:27:05,500
Oh!

465
00:27:11,626 --> 00:27:14,417
So I got some ideas,
you know, for you.

466
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,167
Get you on your feet.

467
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,792
Unless, of course, you already
know what you wanna do.

468
00:27:18,876 --> 00:27:20,459
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

469
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:23,918
Well, yeah. I kinda got an idea.

470
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,167
Yeah?

471
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:28,459
Like four years in,

472
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:29,876
I got moved to Springfield.

473
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:32,334
You know, where they got
the big prison hospital.

474
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,250
It's mostly stab wounds, detox.

475
00:27:34,334 --> 00:27:37,083
Anyway, this guy
I knew from Elkton,

476
00:27:37,167 --> 00:27:40,834
he was telling me how I
could be an orderly, you know?

477
00:27:40,918 --> 00:27:42,792
And how it's
like easy time and all.

478
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:45,584
Well, you know, so then you're
the guy that hooks everybody up.

479
00:27:45,667 --> 00:27:47,167
That's smart.

480
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,167
Yeah, but it
wasn't business for me.

481
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,417
I mean, I really got
into this shit.

482
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,584
Rehab block had guys
with broken limbs,

483
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:57,542
muscle diseases,
and we'd help 'em back.

484
00:27:57,626 --> 00:28:01,751
So I think this might
be a thing I can do.

485
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,792
I got my associate's degree
already. Took me five years.

486
00:28:07,876 --> 00:28:12,125
And now it's only like six months
more for my massage license.

487
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:14,500
So you wanna run
a massage parlor?

488
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:17,375
No.

489
00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:20,584
I'm gonna be
a licensed massage therapist.

490
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:27,042
Look, I've been away
from all this a long time.

491
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:31,667
I mean, if I got a shot at staying
out and putting shit together,

492
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:34,209
- I should take it.
- Oh.

493
00:28:34,292 --> 00:28:40,209
'Cause I was thinking, you know,
I got this air bag thing going...

494
00:28:40,292 --> 00:28:41,918
Oh, Ton', thanks, but...

495
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,792
I mean,
it's a really nice offer,

496
00:28:43,876 --> 00:28:46,417
but I need regular work
until I'm certified.

497
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,834
Just regular work.

498
00:28:52,918 --> 00:28:54,792
Well, I guess
I know this guy looking

499
00:28:54,876 --> 00:28:59,626
for a delivery man
for his linen fleet.

500
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:05,167
- Bobby Gociletto?
- No, no, no, Koreans.

501
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,250
You know, I don't
got my driver's license.

502
00:29:07,334 --> 00:29:09,626
So you'll go to my guy
at the DMV.

503
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:15,083
As far as the union shit,
I can take care of that.

504
00:29:16,584 --> 00:29:19,834
Wow, Ton'. Thanks. Thank you.

505
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:22,834
Come here.

506
00:29:22,918 --> 00:29:25,918
- You're the best, you know that?
- Yeah, yeah.

507
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:38,584
- Out.
- Why?

508
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:41,626
Because we are watching a
movie and you are studying.

509
00:29:41,709 --> 00:29:45,292
And why must we keep
having that conversation?

510
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:47,667
Here it is.

511
00:29:47,751 --> 00:29:49,626
Number one on the
American Film Institute's

512
00:29:49,709 --> 00:29:52,959
Greatest American Movies list.
Citizen Kane.

513
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:55,334
- Jesus, it's black and white.
- Oh, come on.

514
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:58,209
That is what film club is
all about, trying new things.

515
00:29:58,292 --> 00:30:03,042
Now, to give us some background,
let's see what Leonard Maltin has to say.

516
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:07,042
"A film that broke all the rules
and invented some new ones.

517
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:10,500
The cinematography, music
and Oscar-winning screenplay

518
00:30:10,584 --> 00:30:14,792
by Welles and Herman J...
something are all first rate."

519
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:31,626
- Wow.
- So it was a sled, huh?

520
00:31:31,709 --> 00:31:33,626
He should've told somebody.

521
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:36,459
I think it's fascinating that
the man had all that stuff,

522
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:40,042
but he died, you know,
alone with nothing and nobody.

523
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:42,083
Good. Prick.

524
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:46,667
I hated it. "You supply the
war, I'll supply the headlines."

525
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:48,375
How conceited.

526
00:31:52,626 --> 00:31:56,000
- There was the cinematography.
- Yeah, that was very good.

527
00:32:01,626 --> 00:32:04,042
- Oh, my God.
- What?

528
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:07,292
I saw Laura Basi in the
dressing room at Loehmann's.

529
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:09,334
Definitely had some work.

530
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:11,500
D-cup at least, and a lift.

531
00:32:11,584 --> 00:32:15,334
Well, she said she was remodeling
her upstairs, but I had no idea.

532
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,292
So, Carm, how you doing?

533
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,500
I'm okay.

534
00:32:25,584 --> 00:32:28,500
My lawyer, he's a top guy,
Robert Greenberg.

535
00:32:28,584 --> 00:32:32,667
He says that New Jersey has
this equitable distribution law.

536
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:36,125
So apparently 20 years entitles
me to at least half his money.

537
00:32:36,209 --> 00:32:40,209
Well, it should. You made Tony
a home, you raised his children.

538
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,042
Does this guy know
how to get it?

539
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,709
Well, it's mostly cash,
obviously.

540
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:49,000
God, all those years,
and you could get nothing.

541
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:52,334
This other lawyer, Dan Minditch,
he says that we should play hardball.

542
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:54,209
You know,
go after the real assets.

543
00:32:54,292 --> 00:32:56,334
Marriage is
beautiful in the beginning,

544
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:59,792
but two, three years later?

545
00:32:59,876 --> 00:33:02,709
You'd think there'd
be some romance at least.

546
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:04,918
- Janice, you're a newlywed.
- I know.

547
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,875
Six months and Bobby still
hasn't found my rosebud.

548
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:12,175
Maybe he should hire a reporter.

549
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:15,083
So the movie's over
and they all start talking

550
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:18,542
about their marriages
and how miserable they are.

551
00:33:18,626 --> 00:33:20,792
Bitterness.

552
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:22,584
So besides the movie night?

553
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:26,292
- You have kids?
- No.

554
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:29,209
So did you attend
Carmine Lupertazzi's funeral?

555
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:31,000
I didn't know him.

556
00:33:32,334 --> 00:33:33,709
Movie night was fun, though.

557
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:36,626
Who was there at the
Tony Blundetto homecoming?

558
00:33:36,709 --> 00:33:38,918
I told you, just family.

559
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,626
God, is that all you think
about, is your fucking work?

560
00:33:44,876 --> 00:33:48,083
You don't care how
I feel about anything.

561
00:33:51,918 --> 00:33:52,918
Okay.

562
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:58,334
I was married to an agent.

563
00:33:59,792 --> 00:34:02,876
What happened?
Did he cheat on you?

564
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:06,959
While we were trying
to get pregnant,

565
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:09,500
he climbed right over me to
become an assistant supervisor

566
00:34:09,584 --> 00:34:11,542
on the Milken task force.

567
00:34:11,626 --> 00:34:14,417
Moved to Los Angeles and
jumped a pay grade without me.

568
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,500
My God, that-- that's terrible.

569
00:34:18,584 --> 00:34:20,417
So, where were we?

570
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:29,375
What am I doing?
I can't talk to you.

571
00:34:29,459 --> 00:34:32,626
I can't even talk to Christopher,
and he's my soul mate, for God's sake.

572
00:34:32,709 --> 00:34:34,709
I can't talk to my friends.

573
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:41,334
I am being, like, ripped apart
here, just snitching on people.

574
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:44,500
For what?
What do I get out of it?

575
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:46,416
Maybe take some comfort
in the fact that you're trying

576
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,337
to do the right thing
by helping your government.

577
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:50,375
No, seriously.

578
00:34:52,751 --> 00:34:55,876
For me, it was
when I was in college.

579
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:59,918
My sister's boyfriend, Kyle,
traded our TV for six handguns.

580
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,667
He sold five
to a high school kid,

581
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:05,834
then used the last one
to open a coconut.

582
00:35:05,918 --> 00:35:08,626
The ricochet left
my sister a paraplegic.

583
00:35:10,918 --> 00:35:14,292
I knew I had to do something
about guys like him.

584
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:18,667
And nowhere but the FBI
is the line clearer

585
00:35:18,751 --> 00:35:21,626
between the good guys
and the bad guys.

586
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,667
And you're
with the good guys now.

587
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:33,876
Wow.

588
00:35:35,292 --> 00:35:36,667
Jesus.

589
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:45,959
- Hey.
- T.B.!

590
00:35:46,042 --> 00:35:48,709
I didn't call
for no linen delivery.

591
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:51,584
What do I find at the pork store?
A bunch of guys beating the meat.

592
00:35:54,292 --> 00:35:55,959
- Wanna deal me in?
- Absolutely.

593
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:57,626
Stakes might be
a little high for you.

594
00:35:57,709 --> 00:36:00,000
You know you can't
pay us in napkins.

595
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:03,918
You got to let that dry
before you put on a second coat?

596
00:36:05,876 --> 00:36:08,000
Fuckin' Grandpa Munster
over here.

597
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,250
Oh!

598
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,918
You gonna deal those?

599
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,959
They're not candy bars.
You can let some of 'em go.

600
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:19,167
The fuck's that for?
Drying shirts?

601
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,626
It's a Tao master massage chair.

602
00:36:31,584 --> 00:36:34,876
Oh, I had no idea
I was so tense.

603
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:38,042
It's like my back
is on vacation.

604
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:40,667
Well, it could
definitely use one.

605
00:36:45,584 --> 00:36:47,042
The fuck is this?

606
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:49,500
Hey, T, you gotta try this.

607
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:51,417
He's really fucking good.

608
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,083
There's nothing like being
in the joint

609
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:55,547
to teach you how to ease
another man's tensions.

610
00:36:56,525 --> 00:36:58,042
Jesus Christ,
I'm gone for one hour.

611
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:01,751
All of a sudden it turns
into a fucking slumber party.

612
00:37:01,834 --> 00:37:03,751
Somebody woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

613
00:37:06,209 --> 00:37:07,959
Could I talk to you a minute?

614
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:19,417
None of your fucking business
which side of the bed I wake up on.

615
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,292
- Jesus, it's just an expression.
- Bullshit.

616
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:24,082
And don't tell me you don't
know what I'm talking about.

617
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:26,876
All that Reggie Van Gleason,
"M'boy are you fat."

618
00:37:26,959 --> 00:37:28,918
Things have changed around here.

619
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,083
I'm the boss
of this fucking family.

620
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,792
You're crowding me.

621
00:37:34,876 --> 00:37:37,834
You don't make fun of me.
Got it?

622
00:37:40,709 --> 00:37:42,209
Got it.

623
00:37:46,751 --> 00:37:48,792
And knock off the massage shit.

624
00:37:48,876 --> 00:37:51,417
It's a place of business,
not a Jack LaLanne.

625
00:38:05,209 --> 00:38:07,125
You gotta declare all that?

626
00:38:08,709 --> 00:38:10,042
Most of it, anyway.

627
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,792
Well, if you had
a good bookkeeper...

628
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:16,542
Hey, you got change? Been
fuckin' slidin' this stupid bill

629
00:38:16,626 --> 00:38:18,042
in and out of
the cigarette machine

630
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:19,334
for like an hour.

631
00:38:19,417 --> 00:38:23,125
An hour? I bet you
can go longer than that.

632
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:24,667
Listen to you.

633
00:38:24,751 --> 00:38:27,500
Why do you always
talk like a whore?

634
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:31,375
- Because men like it.
- Yeah?

635
00:38:31,459 --> 00:38:33,292
I think you're right about that.

636
00:38:39,334 --> 00:38:42,792
<i>♪ I don't mind spending
every day ♪</i>

637
00:38:42,876 --> 00:38:47,000
<i>♪ Out on your corner
in the pouring rain ♪</i>

638
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:48,792
Tellin' you,
I'm having a fucking time.

639
00:38:48,876 --> 00:38:52,834
Stay out late, come home
drunk, fuck anyone I want.

640
00:38:52,918 --> 00:38:54,834
Yeah, so what's the difference?

641
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,918
I don't know. It's a mindset.

642
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,834
Jesus Christ.

643
00:39:01,918 --> 00:39:03,417
Ton', I was hoping
you'd be here.

644
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,959
I gotta tell you,

645
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:07,417
you shouldn't go out and eat
up there in Fairfield no more.

646
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,417
The fuck you talkin' about?

647
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,584
I went to collect
from my cop up there,

648
00:39:11,667 --> 00:39:13,042
and he gave me a heads-up.

649
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:14,626
His buddy on the force
saw some car

650
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:17,125
out by Napoleon's diner
a couple of weeks ago.

651
00:39:17,209 --> 00:39:21,083
And I remembered how
your goomah lives up there.

652
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:25,584
- Yeah?
- Guy thought maybe they were fags,

653
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:30,209
but he ran the plate,
and it bounced back a no-hit.

654
00:39:30,292 --> 00:39:31,792
Feds.

655
00:39:31,876 --> 00:39:34,876
Cop said they were just
sitting there in the rain.

656
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:38,876
They always do that,

657
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,708
but I know it wasn't me
they tailed that night

658
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:42,541
'cause my whole life's
in the fucking rearview.

659
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:44,751
- Mine, too.
- Absolutely.

660
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:48,292
It's Massarone.
Aw, Jesus Christ.

661
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:50,709
He flipped, I'd be fucked.

662
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:53,667
We all would.

663
00:39:53,751 --> 00:39:55,375
Well, he ain't been
to the grand jury,

664
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:58,375
because we would have heard
from our girl up there.

665
00:39:58,459 --> 00:40:00,291
They could be just
following him at this point,

666
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:01,918
see if they could
get anything on him.

667
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,958
Yeah, and eventually they'll
bring him in. Jesus Christ.

668
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:06,250
They've turned a lot
fuckin' tougher guys

669
00:40:06,334 --> 00:40:08,751
than Jack Massarone.

670
00:40:08,834 --> 00:40:11,042
You want me to take care of it?

671
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:13,542
All right, we don't know
shit yet, right?

672
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,751
He did give me that
fuckin' painting, though.

673
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:23,292
There was that, Ton'.

674
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:26,000
Can't a guy be fuckin'
nice anymore? Friendly?

675
00:40:28,751 --> 00:40:30,792
So what do you wanna do?

676
00:40:30,876 --> 00:40:32,876
I wanna be
absolutely fuckin' sure.

677
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:35,334
That's what I wanna do.

678
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:37,000
All right, we arrange a meet.

679
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:39,000
I'll feel him out a little bit.

680
00:40:42,459 --> 00:40:44,459
I gotta do it. I know the guy.

681
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:48,292
I know the way he thinks.
I know the way he acts.

682
00:40:50,334 --> 00:40:52,417
My old man was very good
at vibing people out, too.

683
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:57,292
Massarone's up to
something, I'll pick it up.

684
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:05,250
You piece of shit.
I don't believe this.

685
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:20,226
Hold on.

686
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,959
- Yeah.
- I just wanted to thank you

687
00:41:24,042 --> 00:41:26,167
for taking the components
out of the home theater.

688
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,667
Hey, I bought that for us to
watch movies as a family, okay?

689
00:41:29,751 --> 00:41:32,000
Not to entertain
your girlfriends.

690
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:35,417
I talked to my lawyer about
filing a separation agreement.

691
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,792
<i>I'm not paying a lawyer.</i>

692
00:41:36,876 --> 00:41:39,375
We should be able to settle
this thing like adults!

693
00:41:39,459 --> 00:41:42,792
Then stop taking shit
out of the house!

694
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:58,250
- Hey, Tony, what's up?
- Let's take a walk.

695
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:07,125
- There he is, huh?
- Hey, how you doing?

696
00:42:07,209 --> 00:42:09,250
- Good, good. How you doing?
- Okay.

697
00:42:09,334 --> 00:42:12,667
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, watch the curb here.

698
00:42:12,751 --> 00:42:14,792
Hey, wait a second.
Before you say anything,

699
00:42:14,876 --> 00:42:19,042
- have you lost a little weight?
- You think, huh?

700
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:23,083
I don't know.
Listen, I talked to our friend.

701
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:24,780
You know, the one that
celebrates Hanukkah?

702
00:42:24,804 --> 00:42:25,334
Uh-huh.

703
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:28,334
- It's in the works.
- Oh, great, it's good news.

704
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:31,167
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

705
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,334
So I been meaning to ask you...

706
00:42:34,417 --> 00:42:35,792
you noticed anything lately?

707
00:42:35,876 --> 00:42:38,459
What are we talking about?

708
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:41,209
You weren't followed here,
were you?

709
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:45,334
No, I-I don't think so.
I-I'm pretty careful.

710
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,167
All right.

711
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:52,083
Everything else okay,
good EKG and shit, huh?

712
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:54,918
- Yeah, I guess.
- All right.

713
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,834
But I gotta tell you,
I don't like what I'm hearing.

714
00:43:03,751 --> 00:43:04,751
Relax.

715
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,000
It's not worth
losing your hair over.

716
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:11,000
- Right?
- Okay.

717
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:12,542
All right.

718
00:43:15,751 --> 00:43:19,209
I couldn't tell shit. What
the fuck am I, a mind reader?

719
00:43:25,842 --> 00:43:28,276
So what's the next
step here, Ton'?

720
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:32,165
What?

721
00:43:32,789 --> 00:43:35,459
Said I looked like
I lost some weight.

722
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:41,375
- Oh.
- Motherfucker.

723
00:43:45,918 --> 00:43:47,209
Yeah?

724
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:51,500
Hey, whoa, whoa. Take it easy.

725
00:43:53,209 --> 00:43:55,542
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hold on.

726
00:43:55,626 --> 00:43:57,209
That Korean Kim.

727
00:43:57,292 --> 00:43:59,876
Something about your cousin,
I don't know.

728
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,417
Yeah?

729
00:44:09,918 --> 00:44:13,709
It's your fucking linen truck. What
do you want me to do about it?

730
00:44:13,792 --> 00:44:15,626
Yeah, yeah, it's okay.
Fire him. Go ahead.

731
00:44:15,709 --> 00:44:18,500
Put him out in the fuckin'
street, for all I care!

732
00:44:25,584 --> 00:44:27,876
Tony B wants
to pick up some scratch.

733
00:44:27,959 --> 00:44:31,834
He could do this
Massarone thing, if it goes.

734
00:44:31,918 --> 00:44:33,459
What the fuck is
wrong with you?!

735
00:44:33,542 --> 00:44:35,459
The man is trying
to go straight!

736
00:44:35,542 --> 00:44:37,918
Don't you give a fuck
about your cousin?

737
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,876
I'm sorry, T. You're right.

738
00:44:43,417 --> 00:44:46,167
That was a great party
the other night.

739
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:48,962
Fuck him.

740
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:52,143
Guy is fucking useless to me.

741
00:45:02,334 --> 00:45:04,042
Was that a yes on Massarone?

742
00:45:04,525 --> 00:45:06,488
Tony's...

743
00:45:06,712 --> 00:45:08,709
got his own process.

744
00:45:09,592 --> 00:45:11,926
What's to process here?

745
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:15,876
Honestly, Carm,
this is a lot better

746
00:45:15,959 --> 00:45:18,042
than watching Casablanca.

747
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:20,292
I didn't need to see
that movie again anyway.

748
00:45:21,792 --> 00:45:23,042
Even if it kills Tony,

749
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:26,584
I will have that system
back for next time.

750
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:28,542
So what is next on that list?

751
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,417
Number three, The Godfather.

752
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:41,667
Look at us. We'll kill
ourselves for these cigarettes.

753
00:45:41,751 --> 00:45:44,334
You know they
had a bear back here?

754
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:48,083
So how come Angie
Bonpensiero don't come?

755
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:50,250
Please. She's not welcome here.

756
00:45:50,334 --> 00:45:51,667
I thought everybody liked her.

757
00:45:51,751 --> 00:45:53,918
Don't you know about Pussy?

758
00:45:55,834 --> 00:45:57,167
He went in the Program.

759
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:58,792
He turned on everybody, us,

760
00:45:58,876 --> 00:46:01,167
the people he knew
his whole life.

761
00:46:03,876 --> 00:46:07,250
Who knows why people
do what they do?

762
00:46:07,334 --> 00:46:09,417
But what kind
of person does that?

763
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,500
I mean, it's like
Judas or something,

764
00:46:11,584 --> 00:46:13,834
eating that last supper
with Jesus.

765
00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:16,709
And the whole time he knows
they're gonna crucify Him.

766
00:46:16,792 --> 00:46:19,334
I mean, at least Judas
didn't go into any

767
00:46:19,417 --> 00:46:21,292
apostle protection program.

768
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:24,500
He hung himself.
He knew what he did.

769
00:46:29,542 --> 00:46:32,292
Oh, look at you.
You're shivering.

770
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:36,167
I didn't know it
was that cold, sweetie.

771
00:47:50,542 --> 00:47:53,417
I'll tell you, I don't
know how I'd be holding up.

772
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,918
It's just...

773
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,083
I guess you all
are really important to me.

774
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:02,292
Aw, Carm, you'd do the same.

775
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:04,167
We love you so much.

776
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:09,292
Ade, you okay?

777
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,167
What's the matter?

778
00:48:21,542 --> 00:48:25,083
I'm-I'm not what you think.

779
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:27,792
I don't know what to do.

780
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:30,167
I need...

781
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:32,876
I wanna tell you all something.

782
00:48:32,959 --> 00:48:34,667
It's driving me crazy.

783
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:37,584
You know you can
tell us anything.

784
00:48:50,167 --> 00:48:51,167
Oh, God.

785
00:48:54,584 --> 00:48:56,876
She's been drinking like crazy.

786
00:49:01,751 --> 00:49:03,709
- Where are you going?
- Oh!

787
00:49:03,792 --> 00:49:06,542
Oh, my God!

788
00:49:08,042 --> 00:49:09,792
Honey!

789
00:49:09,876 --> 00:49:11,626
I'm fine, okay?
Just leave me alone.

790
00:49:11,709 --> 00:49:14,667
No, you're bleeding.
Let me drive you.

791
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:05,542
Ton'? It's like 3:00
in the morning.

792
00:50:05,626 --> 00:50:09,626
Yeah, yeah. Well, I couldn't sleep,
so I wanted to see if the phone worked.

793
00:50:09,709 --> 00:50:11,792
Well, yeah, it works great.

794
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:14,918
I'm in my mother's basement,
and I can really hear you.

795
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,667
Listen, you should know
that that boss there, Kim,

796
00:50:19,751 --> 00:50:21,792
he's after your ass.

797
00:50:21,876 --> 00:50:23,751
<i>I rub him the wrong way.</i>

798
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:25,834
Maybe you shouldn't be
a masseuse then.

799
00:50:26,918 --> 00:50:28,334
Oh.

800
00:50:28,417 --> 00:50:30,334
<i>Look, Tony, the reason I called,</i>

801
00:50:30,417 --> 00:50:32,751
<i>you know, about the other day, uh...</i>

802
00:50:33,834 --> 00:50:37,083
Look, you can kid around
with me, okay?

803
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:40,167
But not when
the other guys are there.

804
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,375
I gotta maintain respect.

805
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:45,584
No, I know. You're the boss.

806
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,125
Jesus.

807
00:50:47,209 --> 00:50:49,249
See, you gotta be careful
what you say on this phone.

808
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:52,876
It doesn't affect you,
but it affects me.

809
00:50:55,417 --> 00:50:57,876
Right. I'm sorry.

810
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,292
Is everything good over there?

811
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:08,459
You know, my mom's on my case.

812
00:51:08,542 --> 00:51:11,918
Who'd have thought
we'd both be on our own again?

813
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,459
Well, you can get back
together with Carm if you want.

814
00:51:14,542 --> 00:51:17,292
'Course she thinks it's up to her,
and she goes from zero to bitch

815
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:20,292
every time I try to show
any warmth, you know?

816
00:51:20,375 --> 00:51:22,626
That's gotta be tough.

817
00:51:26,209 --> 00:51:29,918
Listen, Ton',
I gotta be up in two hours.

818
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,375
So go to sleep.

819
00:51:31,459 --> 00:51:34,209
<i>But you're my cousin
and my best friend.</i>

820
00:51:34,292 --> 00:51:36,751
You gotta know
we could always talk.

821
00:51:36,834 --> 00:51:39,459
Yeah, well, I'll buy
a fucking lunch box.

822
00:51:43,542 --> 00:51:46,584
All right, go to sleep,
go to sleep.

823
00:53:27,792 --> 00:53:30,542
We gotta talk about
my compensation overall.

824
00:53:30,626 --> 00:53:33,667
Interferon for my son's MS?
That's 20 a year now.

825
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:36,209
Right. You said you were
gonna get us a making ceremony,

826
00:53:36,292 --> 00:53:37,542
which you didn't do.

827
00:53:37,626 --> 00:53:39,626
And here you are
asking for a raise.

828
00:53:39,709 --> 00:53:41,959
Can't you talk
to the higher-ups?

829
00:53:45,459 --> 00:53:48,292
Okay, we made Vito Spatafore

830
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:51,792
as running Ralph Cifaretto's
construction business.

831
00:53:51,876 --> 00:53:53,918
Has Chris ever confirmed that?

832
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:06,167
- You wanna know something?
- What?

833
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:10,584
This girl, she's totally
ripping off her employer.

834
00:54:10,667 --> 00:54:12,876
Probably over a hundred grand.

835
00:54:12,959 --> 00:54:14,626
What do you mean?

836
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,834
Tina Francesco's her name.

837
00:54:16,918 --> 00:54:19,918
She's a bookkeeper
for this furniture wholesaler.

838
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,240
So she makes up vendors,
but she writes them real checks.

839
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:25,876
Then her father cashes them.
Is that like a federal crime?

840
00:54:25,959 --> 00:54:29,500
How many checks?
I mean, how much?

841
00:54:29,584 --> 00:54:32,292
Like I said,
probably over a hundred grand.

842
00:54:34,584 --> 00:54:36,334
Tina...?

843
00:54:36,417 --> 00:54:37,959
Francesco.

844
00:54:41,709 --> 00:54:43,209
The father's name's Victor.

845
00:54:45,167 --> 00:54:48,167
It's Brettler and Sons Imports.
