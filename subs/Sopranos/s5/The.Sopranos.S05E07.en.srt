Don't tell me we're
fighting all the time.

32
00:01:43,575 --> 00:01:45,010
I try to get along.

33
00:01:45,034 --> 00:01:46,908
You can't just say whatever
comes to mind, Tony.

34
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:49,069
You were fucking horrible.
That shit about the roadies.

35
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:51,010
You hit below the belt
yourself, Jan,

36
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:53,676
not to mention you started it.

37
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,309
No cheese for Sophia.

38
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,343
Those kids seem to like you,
sort of.

39
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:02,259
I leave them completely free
to do whatever they want.

40
00:02:02,283 --> 00:02:04,684
How else are they gonna learn
from their mistakes?

41
00:02:05,742 --> 00:02:08,767
Anyway, thank you
for having us over.

42
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,635
What's this you're watching?

43
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:19,392
Beethoven.

44
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:30,010
- Can we get a dog?
- Please?

45
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:32,259
I'll walk him, and I'll
pick up the poo and pee.

46
00:02:32,283 --> 00:02:35,350
Pee? Right.
Start with your underwear.

47
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:38,927
We had a dog.

48
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,559
Remember? Tippy?

49
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:45,510
He got worms, though.
Had to move to the country.

50
00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:47,593
Tippy was gassed, Tony.

51
00:02:47,617 --> 00:02:50,094
Daddy took him to the pound.

52
00:02:50,118 --> 00:02:53,635
He used to drag his ass on
the carpet just to scratch himself.

53
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:55,218
My mother went crazy.

54
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,094
Gassed?

55
00:02:57,118 --> 00:02:59,843
And he's so cynical
about everything else.

56
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:01,135
Father told me

57
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,010
he took him to live on a farm.

58
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:04,385
That's what they always say.

59
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:06,968
That same farm must have
17 billion dogs on it.

60
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:09,350
Dog shit up to the rafters.

61
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,809
Hello?

62
00:03:15,534 --> 00:03:17,017
What?

63
00:03:18,492 --> 00:03:19,802
Oh, no, that's terrible.

64
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:21,259
What? What's the matter?

65
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:23,135
It's Cousin Josephine.

66
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,301
- Aunt Concett' died.
- What happened?

67
00:03:25,325 --> 00:03:28,760
They think it was
a heart attack.

68
00:03:28,784 --> 00:03:33,176
Uncle Zio found her on the
couch after Meet the Press.

69
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,135
We hereby
commend Concetta to the Lord,

70
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,468
embraced in His divine goodness.

71
00:03:39,492 --> 00:03:42,094
Let us go in peace.

72
00:03:42,118 --> 00:03:44,767
Amen. Amen.

73
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:57,676
Listen, as long as we're here,
I was gonna go visit my father,

74
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,218
if you'd like to join me.

75
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:01,760
Five hours, they let me out
for these funerals.

76
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,635
I gotta spend it being maudlin?

77
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,343
It's a beautiful day.

78
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:07,676
Excuse me, I thought you might
wanna go pay your respects

79
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,968
to your brother.

80
00:04:08,992 --> 00:04:11,135
By crying to a chunk of marble?

81
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,468
I can pay my respects
from the after-party.

82
00:04:14,492 --> 00:04:16,433
After-party?

83
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,927
It's those uptake inhibitors.

84
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:24,094
We were skeptical at first,
then his mood really improved.

85
00:04:24,118 --> 00:04:25,642
His memory too.

86
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:49,642
Excuse me.

87
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:55,468
Excuse me. Hi.

88
00:04:55,492 --> 00:04:57,510
Oh, hello.

89
00:04:57,534 --> 00:04:59,059
You knew my mother?

90
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,760
You're Anthony.

91
00:05:02,784 --> 00:05:05,343
Oh, my God.

92
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:07,010
Do I know you?

93
00:05:07,034 --> 00:05:08,176
Oh, no.

94
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,802
No, no, you're not annoying me.

95
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:11,010
No, no...

96
00:05:11,034 --> 00:05:12,593
Do we know each other?

97
00:05:12,617 --> 00:05:14,142
Oh, we met once.

98
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:16,843
I was a friend of your father's.

99
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:18,259
Oh.

100
00:05:18,283 --> 00:05:20,142
Oh.

101
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:24,593
You're the lady
from Bamberger's.

102
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:26,635
From the fur department.

103
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,176
Fran Felstein.

104
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,385
Tony.

105
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:31,017
How you doing?

106
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:35,593
So, what, you...

107
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:37,142
you come visit?

108
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:41,551
I miss your father sometimes.
It's...

109
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,094
It's foolish.

110
00:05:43,118 --> 00:05:45,218
No, don't say that.

111
00:05:45,242 --> 00:05:48,010
No, I was sorry to hear
about your mother.

112
00:05:48,034 --> 00:05:50,892
At least she didn't suffer.

113
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:54,517
She made all of us
suffer instead.

114
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:57,718
Oh, it was a joke.

115
00:05:57,742 --> 00:05:59,226
She made all of us suffer.

116
00:06:00,492 --> 00:06:02,343
Believe me, I heard
the stories from your dad.

117
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:03,850
Yeah.

118
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,094
You'll have to forgive me.
My hearing the last few years...

119
00:06:10,118 --> 00:06:11,968
Well, how about a hearing aid?

120
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:14,176
They got the little ones now.
You can't even see them.

121
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,934
I'm too vain. Anyway...

122
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:18,301
Johnny was very proud of you.

123
00:06:18,325 --> 00:06:22,017
You were very special to him.

124
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:26,094
I'm sure you were too.

125
00:06:26,118 --> 00:06:28,718
You know, Johnny told me
if I ever needed anything,

126
00:06:28,742 --> 00:06:31,142
I should always call his son.

127
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:36,268
What do you need?

128
00:06:37,242 --> 00:06:39,017
Not a thing.

129
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:44,593
Fran Felstein?

130
00:06:44,617 --> 00:06:46,927
That was class.

131
00:06:46,951 --> 00:06:49,010
Got great legs for an old broad.

132
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,802
I was in love with that woman.

133
00:06:50,826 --> 00:06:52,927
She was the reason
I never married.

134
00:06:52,951 --> 00:06:54,676
I wanted to propose.

135
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,135
I had the ring all picked out.

136
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:59,010
So what? She turned you down?

137
00:06:59,034 --> 00:07:02,968
I hesitated. How could I bring
this life we live on a woman?

138
00:07:02,992 --> 00:07:06,760
Anyway, she took it as a sign
I wasn't interested.

139
00:07:06,784 --> 00:07:08,802
And then one night
we were all at the 500 Club

140
00:07:08,826 --> 00:07:11,426
to see Enzo Stuarti.

141
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,802
Your father shows up.

142
00:07:12,826 --> 00:07:16,426
Sy Devore suit, two-inch lapel.

143
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,809
That was that.

144
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,475
She never knew my feelings.
What could I do?

145
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:25,809
For years,
I suffered in silence.

146
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,385
Mario, did you bring
your guitar?

147
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:35,718
Not to this.

148
00:07:35,742 --> 00:07:37,976
♪ Volare, oh-oh ♪

149
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,218
Angie, come on. Sing us a song.

150
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:41,718
You sing, Junior.

151
00:07:41,742 --> 00:07:43,635
Nobody wants to hear me.

152
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:44,892
Mario, remember?

153
00:07:53,283 --> 00:07:54,976
Thank you.

154
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:59,593
Thanks, my name's JT.
I'm an alcoholic and an addict.

155
00:07:59,617 --> 00:08:01,551
Hi, JT.

156
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:03,802
I'm also a TV writer which,
by default,

157
00:08:03,826 --> 00:08:05,802
makes me a douchebag, but...

158
00:08:05,826 --> 00:08:08,760
you would've figured that
out for yourselves in a minute.

159
00:08:08,784 --> 00:08:10,301
Uh...

160
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:14,052
About 15 years ago, I moved
from Jersey to Hollywood,

161
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,392
broke into the biz.

162
00:08:17,534 --> 00:08:19,282
It was a dream come true.
I was making money.

163
00:08:19,283 --> 00:08:22,510
I had the Beemer,
the actress girlfriend.

164
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:24,135
Best of all, I had all
the flake I needed

165
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:25,825
to keep me churning out
that snappy dialogue

166
00:08:25,826 --> 00:08:27,968
for Corbin Bernsen.

167
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:30,135
Drugs, alcohol.

168
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:33,094
That shit practically comes
with the Writers Guild card.

169
00:08:33,118 --> 00:08:37,718
Anyway, before too long,

170
00:08:37,742 --> 00:08:40,017
I discovered heroin.

171
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:44,885
Then things really
started to fall apart.

172
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:49,468
It got so bad that I blew
a deadline on a Nash Bridges.

173
00:08:49,492 --> 00:08:52,135
I got my ass fired.
I didn't work for 18 months.

174
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,426
By the grace of God,

175
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,468
I got myself into a rehab
program in Pennsylvania,

176
00:08:58,492 --> 00:09:00,802
and with the help
of some good friends

177
00:09:00,826 --> 00:09:03,934
that I made there,
I got through it.

178
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,468
Chris, where are you?

179
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:09,101
There's my man Chris, everybody.

180
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:13,301
Anyway, I wanna
talk a little bit

181
00:09:13,325 --> 00:09:16,968
about taking a moral inventory.

182
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:19,385
So we talked for, like, an hour.

183
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:22,052
Well, it turns out
that they had a thing,

184
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:23,301
her and my old man.

185
00:09:23,325 --> 00:09:24,718
Right up till he died.

186
00:09:24,742 --> 00:09:27,433
He got from this woman
what he couldn't get at home.

187
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:31,052
Support.

188
00:09:31,076 --> 00:09:32,927
You know, love.

189
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:35,510
A smile when you walk
in the fucking door.

190
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:38,510
Do you think that justifies
his infidelity?

191
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:40,885
She drove him into
that woman's arms, my mother.

192
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:43,725
To all his women.

193
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:47,426
I'll tell you one thing.

194
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,468
Over the years he was rotting
in that grave,

195
00:09:50,492 --> 00:09:54,226
I can't remember once
my mother going to visit him.

196
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:57,268
But this lady, Fran...

197
00:09:58,826 --> 00:10:01,968
It's possible your mother
found it very painful.

198
00:10:01,992 --> 00:10:03,510
Oh, poor her.

199
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:06,593
What was it like
sitting there with Fran?

200
00:10:06,617 --> 00:10:10,017
It was a little weird at first,
you know...

201
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:13,176
Here I am comforting
my father's mistress.

202
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,968
My mother's lying there, dead.

203
00:10:14,992 --> 00:10:16,385
Are you attracted to her?

204
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:19,184
Come on, she's old enough
to be my mother!

205
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,676
Oh, Jesus Christ,
it's an expression.

206
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,968
Don't cream yourself.

207
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,892
I did not want
to fuck my mother.

208
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:32,135
You should've seen her in her
housedress, with that hairnet.

209
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,760
This conversation'd be over
in two seconds.

210
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:37,760
So, I figured,
why not move back to Jersey?

211
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:39,843
Clean slate. It's better.

212
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:41,843
My new agent,
next week he's got me

213
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:43,343
set up to meet Dick Wolf's guy.

214
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:45,676
I seen Dick Wolf
at Rao's one night.

215
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,226
Guy's got his own limo.

216
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:49,802
That Law & Order money?

217
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:52,052
The guy could have
his own battleship.

218
00:10:52,076 --> 00:10:56,392
But enough of my shit.
How are you doing?

219
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,809
Good, you know.

220
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,927
Working the program.

221
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,850
Oh, yeah?

222
00:11:07,742 --> 00:11:09,259
I had some fucking wine,
all right?

223
00:11:09,283 --> 00:11:11,268
Is that what you wanna hear?

224
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:14,343
Christopher, when was this?

225
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:15,510
I don't know.

226
00:11:15,534 --> 00:11:18,017
My fiancée was in a car crash.

227
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:20,010
I didn't even like it.

228
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:21,510
I went to a meeting
the next day.

229
00:11:21,534 --> 00:11:23,176
But no slip since then?

230
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,927
I've been sober,
and I've been high.

231
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,433
Sober's better.

232
00:11:28,742 --> 00:11:30,760
You know you can call me
anytime, right?

233
00:11:30,784 --> 00:11:31,968
What, do you got a date?

234
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:35,350
I got to meet somebody,
a friend.

235
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,843
Go ahead, I'll get this.

236
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:41,433
Thanks, bro.
Listen, call me. I'm serious.

237
00:12:03,617 --> 00:12:05,259
<i>Harold Melvoin.</i>

238
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:07,010
Mel, it's me.

239
00:12:07,534 --> 00:12:08,676
Corrado, what's up?

240
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,052
<i>There's a funeral
I need to attend.</i>

241
00:12:11,076 --> 00:12:12,892
I want you to call the feds.

242
00:12:13,826 --> 00:12:15,343
Vincent Patronella.

243
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:18,385
Is he a relative?
You know the rules.

244
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:20,052
He's my niece's godfather.

245
00:12:20,076 --> 00:12:22,885
I think I met him at a barbecue
once for the bicentennial.

246
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,767
All they can say is no.

247
00:12:30,534 --> 00:12:33,885
Your father used to bring me
flowers all the time.

248
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:36,226
- Flowers and lingerie.
- Oh.

249
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:38,802
I'm making chicken.

250
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:41,426
Cuban-style with black beans.

251
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,094
Oh.

252
00:12:43,118 --> 00:12:44,885
What's this?

253
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:47,850
Ketchup? Sure. If you want.

254
00:12:51,118 --> 00:12:52,385
No, the kid and the dog.

255
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:54,760
Oh! My son, Bruce.

256
00:12:54,784 --> 00:12:57,052
He married an Israeli girl.

257
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:00,551
He's a food service director
with El Al.

258
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:02,052
No, no, no, the dog.

259
00:13:02,076 --> 00:13:03,934
Oh, Freckles?

260
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,052
He was a gift from your dad.

261
00:13:07,076 --> 00:13:08,767
What?

262
00:13:09,784 --> 00:13:11,559
Oh, when?

263
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,684
Oh, this is my fucking dog!

264
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:19,927
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
This was my dog.

265
00:13:19,951 --> 00:13:22,433
His name was Tippy.

266
00:13:23,283 --> 00:13:25,052
Your dad never said.

267
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:27,517
I don't fucking believe this.

268
00:13:28,492 --> 00:13:30,426
My mother made him
give the dog away.

269
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,635
Well, Bruce loved him.

270
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:37,426
He had him for almost ten years,
till he moved to Tel Aviv.

271
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,767
Then I had to put him to sleep.

272
00:13:42,617 --> 00:13:46,135
Those are the pictures,
on the coffee table.

273
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,017
The slippers were your dad's,
too.

274
00:14:00,325 --> 00:14:01,843
Look at this.

275
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:03,392
The two of you.

276
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:07,094
He used to remind me
of Victor Mature.

277
00:14:07,118 --> 00:14:08,767
Thanks.

278
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:11,176
Oh.

279
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,426
Outside the Latin Quarter.

280
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,676
Holy shit, look at Hesh.

281
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,593
George Gershwin.

282
00:14:18,617 --> 00:14:22,468
He was a whoremaster, and cheap.

283
00:14:22,492 --> 00:14:25,268
You know, he screwed me
out of my retirement money.

284
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,593
Against your dad's wishes,
by the way.

285
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,968
What are you talking about?

286
00:14:29,992 --> 00:14:31,809
Don't get me started.

287
00:14:33,784 --> 00:14:35,802
No, come on, what happened?

288
00:14:35,826 --> 00:14:37,843
Your dad owned a racetrack.

289
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:39,850
With the midget auto racing.

290
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,843
Yeah, the Chickamauga Raceway
over in New Egypt.

291
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:48,135
Him, Herman, some other guy.

292
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,510
Phil something.

293
00:14:49,534 --> 00:14:50,927
With the hair, from New York.

294
00:14:50,951 --> 00:14:53,017
Yeah, Leotardo.

295
00:14:54,118 --> 00:14:56,426
My father cut him in
to pay off a poker debt.

296
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:00,309
Johnny always told me
his piece would go to me.

297
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,767
Couldn't put me in his will,
obviously.

298
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:07,968
When he passed, your dad,

299
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:09,684
I called Hesh.

300
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:14,218
He sent me 500 bucks.

301
00:15:14,242 --> 00:15:15,809
That's it?

302
00:15:16,575 --> 00:15:18,176
I'm sorry.

303
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,684
No.

304
00:15:20,784 --> 00:15:23,059
Jesus Christ,
I wish you'd called me.

305
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:26,385
Bruce sends me money
occasionally.

306
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:29,094
Well, that's not the point.
It's my father's wishes.

307
00:15:29,118 --> 00:15:32,010
Look, forget it.

308
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:34,635
Seriously, I'm sorry. I...

309
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:36,885
I shouldn't have even
brought it up.

310
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:40,850
Listen, after we eat,
you wanna take a ride?

311
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:48,343
So I saw my Uncle Jun.

312
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:50,094
He says to say hello.

313
00:15:50,118 --> 00:15:52,017
Junior?

314
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:54,052
Jesus.

315
00:15:54,076 --> 00:15:55,510
How's he doing?

316
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:56,885
I don't know if you know it,

317
00:15:56,909 --> 00:15:59,718
but he was always
a little hot for you.

318
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:01,385
He was practically a stalker.

319
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:03,301
He said he suffered in silence.

320
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:04,885
Suffered in silence?

321
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:08,259
He used to skulk outside
my building, all hours.

322
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:09,802
Weird phone calls.

323
00:16:09,826 --> 00:16:11,052
I always had a hunch

324
00:16:11,076 --> 00:16:12,802
he told Livia
about me and Johnny.

325
00:16:12,826 --> 00:16:14,475
Jesus Christ.

326
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:18,927
She was a handsome woman,
your mother.

327
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:23,809
Not sexy, exactly,
but statuesque.

328
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,184
Little nip?

329
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:29,551
What is it?

330
00:16:29,575 --> 00:16:31,426
It's one for the road, honey.

331
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,802
And this looks like road to me.

332
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,059
Rémy Martin, VSOP.

333
00:16:39,617 --> 00:16:41,725
Mm.

334
00:16:47,242 --> 00:16:50,392
Whoa.

335
00:16:51,534 --> 00:16:52,885
They can't be making much,

336
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:54,426
but if I know Hesh,

337
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,433
him and Phil got something
going on out of here.

338
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:03,510
So tell me about your women.

339
00:17:03,534 --> 00:17:05,184
Your wife, what's she like?

340
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:08,218
I don't know.

341
00:17:08,242 --> 00:17:10,433
What's to tell?

342
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:14,059
Good woman, good mother.

343
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:17,426
Marriage hit the rocks,
that's all.

344
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,433
What are you gonna do?

345
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:22,885
How about your girlfriend?

346
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,510
She's an art dealer.

347
00:17:24,534 --> 00:17:26,343
Very sophisticated.

348
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:29,259
Dark hair, dark eyes.

349
00:17:29,283 --> 00:17:31,301
She's Latin.

350
00:17:31,325 --> 00:17:33,059
You know, from Spain.

351
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,600
That's it.

352
00:17:46,034 --> 00:17:48,176
Oh, man, I am so glad
you called.

353
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,309
I really needed this.

354
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,426
So?

355
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,843
So, what?

356
00:17:57,867 --> 00:17:59,843
What, there's nothing
you wanna talk about?

357
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:02,642
I was honest with you
the other night.

358
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:07,760
What, you're telling me
you're not using?

359
00:18:07,784 --> 00:18:09,094
What?

360
00:18:09,118 --> 00:18:10,843
You ran out of IHOP
like you were on fire.

361
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:12,510
You were jonesing
like a motherfucker.

362
00:18:12,534 --> 00:18:15,218
I was meeting a girl.
We were going to the track.

363
00:18:15,242 --> 00:18:16,510
The Meadowlands.

364
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:18,468
I didn't wanna miss
the last race.

365
00:18:18,492 --> 00:18:21,593
I am totally clean and sober.

366
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:22,760
Jesus Christ.

367
00:18:22,784 --> 00:18:24,843
I was positive
you fucking slipped.

368
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:26,135
Thank you, man.

369
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:27,892
I appreciate your concern.

370
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:33,934
I could have saved you a trip.

371
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:36,968
I'll take your action.

372
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,010
You take a dime each
on the Yankees and St. Louis?

373
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,426
Whoa, high roller.

374
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,059
Just got a three-grand residual
on a That's Life episode.

375
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,052
What, that fake guinea-fest
with Paul Sorvino?

376
00:18:49,076 --> 00:18:52,350
That was totally unrealistic.

377
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:56,135
So dusty here.

378
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:57,684
Yeah.

379
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:01,135
That silk?

380
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:02,968
It ain't Kleenex.

381
00:19:02,992 --> 00:19:04,559
It's linen.

382
00:19:05,784 --> 00:19:07,976
You know, you're very...

383
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:11,392
I don't know,
you got a lot of class.

384
00:19:13,283 --> 00:19:15,268
Just like your girlfriend.

385
00:19:23,992 --> 00:19:25,908
He told me to look out for her,
so I sent her some money,

386
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:27,699
which is a helluva lot more
than anybody else did.

387
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,343
Then all these years, you decide
to keep his end for yourself?

388
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:32,010
Oh, I should give it
to some trollop, huh?

389
00:19:32,034 --> 00:19:33,676
Besides, I thought
I had it coming.

390
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,385
With Phil Leotardo
in the can for 20 years,

391
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:37,385
who do you think's been
running that place, huh?

392
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,385
Collecting the rent,
filing the taxes,

393
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:40,718
all that bullshit?

394
00:19:40,742 --> 00:19:42,176
What about my share?

395
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,309
All those years,
I never saw a dime.

396
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:49,802
You're my father's friend, Hesh.
My friend!

397
00:19:49,826 --> 00:19:51,968
Oh, I'm such a good friend,
how come I never see you?

398
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:56,135
What? I see you.
I'm fucking busy.

399
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:59,760
Never too busy to call me at 2:00
a.m. to hear your problems, though.

400
00:19:59,784 --> 00:20:01,593
One time, that happened.

401
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,968
My therapist was on vacation.

402
00:20:02,992 --> 00:20:05,885
Listen, you want his end,
kid, you got it.

403
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:07,551
It's 25%.

404
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:09,135
The closing is not
for two weeks,

405
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:11,593
and I would appreciate it
if you called Phil Leotardo

406
00:20:11,617 --> 00:20:14,052
and tell him that he should
assume part of that burden.

407
00:20:14,076 --> 00:20:18,426
Well, despite how you feel,
my father loved this woman.

408
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,551
She's not such a bad person.
But I don't know.

409
00:20:21,575 --> 00:20:25,094
Something about her always
rubbed me the wrong way.

410
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:27,135
Maybe because she was
rubbing him and not you.

411
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,718
How long you know me, bub, huh?

412
00:20:29,742 --> 00:20:32,559
She's a little pale
for my taste.

413
00:20:38,283 --> 00:20:41,642
Mr. Patronella was last week.
This is a different one.

414
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:45,684
Yes, I'm aware he's been
to two funerals in a month.

415
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:50,059
Well, people die, Counselor.

416
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:54,426
The deceased in question now,
Mrs. Crilley,

417
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,559
was the sister
of Mr. Soprano's cousin.

418
00:20:58,409 --> 00:20:59,892
By marriage.

419
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:03,259
So she's not
a blood relative per se.

420
00:21:03,283 --> 00:21:04,885
Are we quibbling now?
For God's sake,

421
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:07,392
the man wants to pay
his respects.

422
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,259
Well, perhaps my next call
should be to Judge Runions.

423
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:13,142
Get him involved.

424
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:18,760
Five hours.

425
00:21:18,784 --> 00:21:20,968
It's not a Hawaiian vacation.

426
00:21:20,992 --> 00:21:22,551
He'll attend the church service,

427
00:21:22,575 --> 00:21:25,059
then pay his respects
to the family afterwards.

428
00:21:27,575 --> 00:21:29,094
Thank you, Counselor.

429
00:21:29,118 --> 00:21:31,142
We appreciate it.

430
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,684
You're worth every fucking cent.

431
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:44,635
They're gonna have Scottish
bagpipes at the funeral.

432
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:46,725
It should be interesting.

433
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:01,052
Don Provolone.

434
00:22:01,076 --> 00:22:03,226
See that fucking game?

435
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:06,385
Diet Coke and whatever
he's having.

436
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,934
Ginger ale?

437
00:22:09,534 --> 00:22:11,802
Remind me to send Jeter
a dozen roses.

438
00:22:11,826 --> 00:22:13,259
You wanna parlay it?

439
00:22:13,283 --> 00:22:15,426
I was thinking I'd go check out
that Indian casino,

440
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,802
play some poker.

441
00:22:16,826 --> 00:22:19,635
You want in a real game,
I'll hook you up.

442
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:22,684
High stakes,
exclusive clientele.

443
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,010
- David Lee Roth.
- I'll tell you, man,

444
00:22:26,034 --> 00:22:30,593
playing cards, games of chance,
I never really dug it before.

445
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:32,259
I was never that good at math.

446
00:22:32,283 --> 00:22:35,725
But there's something about
that excitement that's so...

447
00:22:36,784 --> 00:22:38,268
I don't know.

448
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:43,135
What is wrong? I win one bet,
you look like you're gonna cry.

449
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:45,226
I fucked up again.

450
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,259
My super came by this morning

451
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,642
to fucking caulk
around the toilet.

452
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:52,593
He had some weed.

453
00:22:52,617 --> 00:22:54,176
You have got to call someone

454
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,385
before you use, not after.

455
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:58,176
I know, I know.

456
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,094
I just wanted to see if I could
get high like a normal person.

457
00:23:01,118 --> 00:23:03,718
You're not normal.
Neither of us are.

458
00:23:03,742 --> 00:23:07,767
And on top of that,
you ask me to meet you at a bar?

459
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,725
Come here, you maniac.

460
00:23:13,784 --> 00:23:17,635
625K for the track
plus all that land?

461
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:19,010
That's it?

462
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:20,385
Problem's the zoning
restrictions.

463
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:22,176
We're lucky we got
a buyer at all.

464
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,184
Here's what I propose.

465
00:23:25,242 --> 00:23:27,635
Tony gets 150.

466
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:29,635
25% comes from you,

467
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,139
the other 75% of that
comes from Hesh.

468
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,551
Jesus Christ,
that's like 40 grand.

469
00:23:33,575 --> 00:23:35,135
You gotta be fucking
kidding me, John.

470
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:37,642
Am I smiling?

471
00:23:40,742 --> 00:23:43,259
You got some balls, kid,
I'll give you that much.

472
00:23:43,283 --> 00:23:44,825
You'll give me
what I tell you to give me.

473
00:23:44,826 --> 00:23:46,426
- Whoa, Tony, come on.
- Take it easy.

474
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,176
- Take it easy.
- Fuck that!

475
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,510
This ain't the '70s.

476
00:23:49,534 --> 00:23:51,468
And I'm not a kid.

477
00:23:51,492 --> 00:23:52,718
Relax, it's an expression.

478
00:23:52,742 --> 00:23:54,094
Well, here's another expression.

479
00:23:54,118 --> 00:23:55,976
You got five days
to give me my money.

480
00:23:57,951 --> 00:23:59,392
Come on.

481
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,843
That was out of line.

482
00:24:07,867 --> 00:24:09,176
Philly, he's a boss.

483
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,259
Jersey?

484
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,767
Come on, huh?

485
00:24:16,575 --> 00:24:19,718
Well, I talked to Phil and Hesh
about the racetrack.

486
00:24:19,742 --> 00:24:22,094
How bad did they bullshit you?

487
00:24:22,118 --> 00:24:24,176
Well, actually,
we straightened it all out.

488
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,968
So when the sale goes through,

489
00:24:25,992 --> 00:24:27,885
you're looking at a nice
piece of change.

490
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:29,885
- You're kidding?
- No.

491
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:33,226
Hey, that's wonderful.

492
00:24:35,992 --> 00:24:37,850
I wanted to show you something.

493
00:24:39,118 --> 00:24:41,517
You were admiring
my handkerchief.

494
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,559
Check out the initials.

495
00:24:56,492 --> 00:24:58,094
JFK? Holy shit!

496
00:24:58,118 --> 00:24:59,642
This was his?

497
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:02,135
You know, I have a hat of his.

498
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,094
A captain's hat
I bought at an auction.

499
00:25:06,118 --> 00:25:07,635
A lot of the friends
don't like him.

500
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:09,551
You know,
Ruby and all that shit.

501
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:12,760
But, fuck,
I was in grammar school.

502
00:25:12,784 --> 00:25:14,475
That's my lipstick.

503
00:25:16,076 --> 00:25:17,843
We had a little thing.

504
00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:19,676
When he was president?

505
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,010
March '61.

506
00:25:21,034 --> 00:25:22,968
Right before the Bay of Pigs.

507
00:25:22,992 --> 00:25:25,802
I was at the Copa
with a girlfriend.

508
00:25:25,826 --> 00:25:28,885
I'm wearing a new sable,
and we meet Lem Billings.

509
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:32,510
Now, Lem is a school friend
of Jack's from Choate,

510
00:25:32,534 --> 00:25:33,968
but of course we had no idea.

511
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:36,135
He insists that we join him

512
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,760
for some affair
at the Pierre Hotel.

513
00:25:38,784 --> 00:25:40,885
He won't take no.

514
00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:44,843
He has a limo, we figure,
"What the hell?"

515
00:25:44,867 --> 00:25:46,052
You know, so...

516
00:25:46,076 --> 00:25:48,510
We go over, and he tells us

517
00:25:48,534 --> 00:25:51,218
he's taking us
to the presidential suite.

518
00:25:51,242 --> 00:25:54,802
So we get up,
out of the elevator.

519
00:25:54,826 --> 00:25:56,176
We go in the suite.

520
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,010
It is crawling with models,
celebrities.

521
00:26:00,034 --> 00:26:02,843
Peter Lawford, Sinatra.

522
00:26:02,867 --> 00:26:04,094
Jackie Gleason.

523
00:26:04,118 --> 00:26:05,593
- No shit.
- Yeah.

524
00:26:05,617 --> 00:26:07,176
I'm looking around.

525
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,676
And I glance across the room,

526
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,676
and suddenly, I am locking eyes

527
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,934
with John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

528
00:26:18,242 --> 00:26:21,802
Yeah, I mean, he comes over.
He is a perfect gentleman.

529
00:26:21,826 --> 00:26:23,676
He takes my coat,
he brings me a cocktail,

530
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,301
introduces me around.

531
00:26:25,325 --> 00:26:27,676
And finally, at the end
of the night-- now, get this--

532
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,927
"In the interests of
national security," he says,

533
00:26:30,951 --> 00:26:33,094
he needs me to stay.

534
00:26:33,118 --> 00:26:34,343
Since I'm wearing a sable,

535
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:36,468
he needs to personally
interview me,

536
00:26:36,492 --> 00:26:39,510
make sure I'm not working
for the Russians.

537
00:26:39,534 --> 00:26:41,510
He said that?

538
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:42,850
Some line, huh?

539
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:46,927
What was he like?

540
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:49,426
- Wonderful.
- So were you two an item?

541
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,135
No. He called.

542
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:53,343
But after all,
this man was the leader

543
00:26:53,367 --> 00:26:54,551
of the free world.

544
00:26:54,575 --> 00:26:55,843
I mean, you know...

545
00:26:55,867 --> 00:26:57,094
I remember one weekend,

546
00:26:57,118 --> 00:26:59,052
I was supposed to go
down to D.C.,

547
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:00,426
stay at the Ritz-Carlton.

548
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,551
Last minute, emergency meeting.

549
00:27:03,575 --> 00:27:05,676
Steel workers
are going on strike.

550
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,976
So, what, it was just
that one time, or...?

551
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,927
Except for, you know,
after the Bay of Pigs,

552
00:27:11,951 --> 00:27:13,968
he was probably pretty busy.

553
00:27:13,992 --> 00:27:15,718
Yeah, I knew there were others.

554
00:27:15,742 --> 00:27:18,802
Judy Campbell.
And Marilyn, of course.

555
00:27:18,826 --> 00:27:21,301
We had something special,
though.

556
00:27:21,325 --> 00:27:22,968
Crazy passion.

557
00:27:22,992 --> 00:27:25,885
That was something
your mother never understood.

558
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:28,968
When you're married
to a powerful man,

559
00:27:28,992 --> 00:27:32,850
you damn well better
make him feel powerful.

560
00:27:34,076 --> 00:27:35,642
My mother?

561
00:27:36,617 --> 00:27:38,176
Please.

562
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,850
I saw a picture of Livia
on New Year's Eve.

563
00:27:42,034 --> 00:27:44,976
She was dressed like a refugee.

564
00:27:47,283 --> 00:27:49,551
Listen, I think I'm going
to skip the coffee.

565
00:27:49,575 --> 00:27:52,268
I got a meeting in the city.

566
00:27:53,034 --> 00:27:55,725
Are you-- you sure?

567
00:27:57,034 --> 00:27:58,892
Look...

568
00:28:00,742 --> 00:28:02,510
consider this an advance.

569
00:28:02,534 --> 00:28:05,934
Get your phone turned on
and pay your rent.

570
00:28:07,034 --> 00:28:09,184
Your dad would be so proud.

571
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,475
He raised a real gentleman.

572
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:23,510
You trying to buy this pot?

573
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:25,600
800 and you'll know.

574
00:28:27,367 --> 00:28:29,142
What the fuck.

575
00:28:32,575 --> 00:28:35,094
Cowboys and three
little Indians.

576
00:28:35,118 --> 00:28:38,101
Fuck me!

577
00:28:41,826 --> 00:28:44,059
I got a lot of big people
coming next week.

578
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:49,010
So when you write on TV,
what do they have, like,

579
00:28:49,034 --> 00:28:50,927
one guy writes the words
for Dylan McDermott

580
00:28:50,951 --> 00:28:53,676
and one guy writes
for Nicholson's girlfriend?

581
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,885
That the way it is?

582
00:28:54,909 --> 00:28:58,426
You write it all yourself.

583
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,142
Oh, interesting.

584
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:02,259
So how you doing?

585
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:03,551
You wanna take off?

586
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,551
I'm getting killed here.

587
00:29:05,575 --> 00:29:08,593
I'm gonna go. I'm fucking shot.

588
00:29:08,617 --> 00:29:10,094
I'll call you tomorrow.

589
00:29:10,118 --> 00:29:11,468
You wanna work out?

590
00:29:11,492 --> 00:29:12,843
Sure, yeah, whatever.

591
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:15,010
Four of clubs to Joe Hollywood,

592
00:29:15,034 --> 00:29:17,094
jack for the car-wash king.

593
00:29:17,118 --> 00:29:20,059
Ten for Mr. Vito.

594
00:29:23,617 --> 00:29:27,600
Show Valentina you love her!

595
00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:58,642
They were out of the Citrucel.

596
00:30:00,492 --> 00:30:02,725
Where you goin'?

597
00:30:03,492 --> 00:30:04,885
Gotta order some flowers.

598
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:07,760
Sal from the dry cleaner's,
his kid died.

599
00:30:07,784 --> 00:30:09,135
Drowned in a Jacuzzi.

600
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:11,010
Seven years old, you believe it?

601
00:30:11,034 --> 00:30:12,892
Fuckin' tragedy.

602
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,426
Harold Melvoin.

603
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,676
It's me.

604
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,927
I got another funeral. A kid.

605
00:30:28,951 --> 00:30:31,176
His father does my shirts.

606
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,176
Corrado, it has
to be a relative.

607
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,259
It is a relative, goddamn it.

608
00:30:35,283 --> 00:30:38,510
My old man came over with this
kid's great-great-grandfather.

609
00:30:38,534 --> 00:30:39,968
The guy had a club foot.

610
00:30:39,992 --> 00:30:41,593
That's rather tenuous,
don't you think?

611
00:30:41,617 --> 00:30:43,176
The whole fuckin' village
of Avellino

612
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,468
settled in this area.

613
00:30:44,492 --> 00:30:45,866
We gotta be related
somewhere down the line.

614
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:47,676
- Corrado...
- Corrado, my balls!

615
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,176
I gotta get out of this house.
I'm going fucking stir-crazy.

616
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,850
Seventh Street coming out.

617
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:01,135
Holy shit.

618
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,301
You're still here?

619
00:31:02,325 --> 00:31:04,843
Called you all day yesterday.

620
00:31:04,867 --> 00:31:06,350
We're in a hand here.

621
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:09,010
What do you wanna do?

622
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,642
Fold.

623
00:31:13,534 --> 00:31:15,094
Here, fuck it.

624
00:31:15,118 --> 00:31:16,976
I'm all in.

625
00:31:18,242 --> 00:31:19,551
Call.

626
00:31:19,575 --> 00:31:21,385
Pair of tens.

627
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:23,052
Flush.

628
00:31:23,076 --> 00:31:24,551
Caught it on the river.

629
00:31:24,575 --> 00:31:27,301
Motherfucking...

630
00:31:27,325 --> 00:31:28,976
fuck!

631
00:31:32,575 --> 00:31:34,176
How bad?

632
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,094
He owes the house 57.

633
00:31:36,118 --> 00:31:37,725
Thousand?

634
00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:47,885
What are you, fuckin' crazy?

635
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:49,892
Define crazy.

636
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,075
I'm good for it.
I'm up for this Dick Wolf thing.

637
00:31:53,076 --> 00:31:55,510
If I get on staff,
it's like a month's salary.

638
00:31:55,534 --> 00:31:57,684
Well, how about
this fuckin' month?

639
00:32:00,034 --> 00:32:02,718
Hey, you think you could
spot me for a while?

640
00:32:02,742 --> 00:32:04,725
I-I got some child support too.

641
00:32:08,617 --> 00:32:10,052
I'll cover this.

642
00:32:10,076 --> 00:32:11,802
I'll give you three grand
for incidentals.

643
00:32:11,826 --> 00:32:13,676
That's 60,000 altogether.

644
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,676
I've only been up two days.
I can still add.

645
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,927
Good. Then add two points
every week

646
00:32:17,951 --> 00:32:20,052
till I'm paid in fucking full.

647
00:32:20,076 --> 00:32:21,843
You're charging me vig?

648
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:24,385
On top of the principal.
It's compounded if you're late.

649
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:27,218
That's 1,200
one week from today.

650
00:32:27,242 --> 00:32:30,259
Don't give me that look.
This is your problem.

651
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:32,433
I will not fucking enable you.

652
00:32:37,409 --> 00:32:40,309

Phil.

656
00:32:55,659 --> 00:32:57,676
Phil, where are you going?

657
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,259
Hey, Tony, I gotta meet John
down the restaurant.

658
00:33:00,283 --> 00:33:02,392

Where you gonna go?

663
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,268
You motherfucker!

664
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:55,135
Jesus Christ.

665
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,593
Mister, you okay in there?

666
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,802
Oh, my neck!

667
00:33:57,826 --> 00:33:59,343
- Oh! Oh!
- You all right?

668
00:33:59,367 --> 00:34:01,718
You run from me,
you fucking cocksucker?

669
00:34:01,742 --> 00:34:03,426
Where's my fuckin' money?

670
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:06,218
I'll get it. I'll get it.
My neck, Tony.

671
00:34:06,242 --> 00:34:07,843
What do you think,
I'm an asshole? Huh?

672
00:34:07,867 --> 00:34:09,301
No, no, no. No, Tony.

673
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:12,350
- I can't hear you.
- No, no. Please, Tony.

674
00:34:13,826 --> 00:34:15,600
You got 24 hours.

675
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:20,968
Called 911.
They're on their way.

676
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,350
He's all right.

677
00:34:24,826 --> 00:34:27,059
Oh, my God.

678
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:32,135
Oh, my baby.

679
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,968
Take her upstairs, Andy.

680
00:34:33,992 --> 00:34:35,176
My baby...

681
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,085
She should probably take
one of those tranquillizers

682
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:39,139
her mother gave her.

683
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,385
We should go, Junior.

684
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:49,517
Relax, we just got here.

685
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:52,684
Chicken's nice and spicy, huh?

686
00:35:11,617 --> 00:35:13,135
I know you're in there.

687
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:15,684
You're casting a shadow
over the peephole.

688
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:19,976
Hey.

689
00:35:21,076 --> 00:35:22,635
What, are you ducking me?

690
00:35:22,659 --> 00:35:24,635
No, what are you...?

691
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:28,094
I thought you were this girl.
She's a pain in the ass.

692
00:35:28,118 --> 00:35:31,468
So, what the fuck?
Where you been?

693
00:35:31,492 --> 00:35:33,760
Working, man.
I got those TV pitch meetings.

694
00:35:33,784 --> 00:35:35,413
I was gonna call you.

695
00:35:35,437 --> 00:35:37,559
Yeah, so why didn't you?

696
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:44,510
All right, look.
You want the truth?

697
00:35:44,534 --> 00:35:46,468
I was away. I went to AC.

698
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:49,301
- Where's my money?
- I don't have it yet.

699
00:35:49,325 --> 00:35:50,635
But you went to AC.

700
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:54,392
I have a meeting next week
with René Balcer.

701
00:35:55,867 --> 00:35:58,010
Dick Wolf's right-hand guy.

702
00:35:58,034 --> 00:35:59,593
He likes my stuff.
He told my agent.

703
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:01,176
I'm gonna be on staff.

704
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,218
I got out of that business
'cause people fuck you over.

705
00:36:04,242 --> 00:36:05,927
Jon Favreau?

706
00:36:05,951 --> 00:36:07,968
Faggot cocksucker
tried to steal my ideas.

707
00:36:07,992 --> 00:36:10,426
Bro, listen,
I swear on all that's holy,

708
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,885
I'll have your money next week.

709
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:14,426
That wasn't the deal!
I'll be back tomorrow.

710
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,350
Don't make me a jerkoff.

711
00:36:19,867 --> 00:36:21,426
Damn, I'm happy.

712
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,010
Get a load of these.

713
00:36:23,034 --> 00:36:24,843
My new kicks.

714
00:36:24,867 --> 00:36:28,184
Bottega Veneta,
marked down to only 600.

715
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:31,802
Thought you were paying
your phone bill.

716
00:36:31,826 --> 00:36:33,593
Oh, I should've, I know.

717
00:36:33,617 --> 00:36:39,600
But it's been so long since
I've been able to treat myself.

718
00:36:41,951 --> 00:36:43,892
Oh, thanks.

719
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:51,176
So, turns out my Uncle Zio's
going downhill.

720
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,968
The day we met,
I told you we were there

721
00:36:52,992 --> 00:36:56,718
at the cemetery to bury
his wife, my Aunt Concetta.

722
00:36:56,742 --> 00:36:59,350
Seventy years,
they were together.

723
00:37:00,867 --> 00:37:03,268
Poor guy's taking it very hard.

724
00:37:10,575 --> 00:37:12,218
Oh!

725
00:37:12,242 --> 00:37:14,725
My knight in shining armor.

726
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:23,892
So?

727
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,400
Yeah, good morning to you too.

728
00:37:27,409 --> 00:37:28,927
- You got it?
- Jesus.

729
00:37:28,951 --> 00:37:32,052
You are a fuckin' trip.

730
00:37:32,076 --> 00:37:34,551
I'm J.T., by the way.

731
00:37:34,575 --> 00:37:36,551
What is this, fuckin'
Pulp Fiction?

732
00:37:36,575 --> 00:37:38,010
Am I supposed to be afraid?

733
00:37:38,034 --> 00:37:39,760
I don't know. I didn't see it.

734
00:37:39,784 --> 00:37:41,301
You're really being
a prick, huh?

735
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,718
I told you, I need more time.
I don't have the money.

736
00:37:43,742 --> 00:37:45,052
Then fucking get it.

737
00:37:45,076 --> 00:37:46,718
Chris, you know me.

738
00:37:46,742 --> 00:37:47,991
What could you possibly do to me

739
00:37:47,992 --> 00:37:49,551
that I haven't already
been through?

740
00:37:49,575 --> 00:37:52,385
I'm positive
we'll think of something.

741
00:37:52,409 --> 00:37:55,976
Ah! Oh, my God!

742
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:10,135
And 66 years
after taking those sacred vows,

743
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:12,052
"till death do us part,"

744
00:38:12,076 --> 00:38:15,052
Concetta left him
and went home to God.

745
00:38:15,076 --> 00:38:20,802
In the two weeks that followed,
Nicolo struggled without her,

746
00:38:20,826 --> 00:38:23,309
finally succumbing
to irredeemable loss.

747
00:38:24,325 --> 00:38:27,176
The enormity of his grief

748
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,426
can hardly be imagined.

749
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:33,927
How much they went
through together.

750
00:38:33,951 --> 00:38:36,635
Seeing their children grow,

751
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:38,593
and looking joyfully on

752
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:42,052
as their grandchildren
had children.

753
00:38:42,076 --> 00:38:45,094
Sickness and health.

754
00:38:45,118 --> 00:38:46,718
Good times and bad.

755
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:50,301
But through it all,
one thing remained constant.

756
00:38:50,325 --> 00:38:52,593
They had each other.

757
00:38:52,617 --> 00:38:55,301
It was Nicolo's love
for Concetta

758
00:38:55,325 --> 00:38:57,218
that made him leave this earth

759
00:38:57,242 --> 00:39:00,510
a mere 15 days
after she left him.

760
00:39:00,534 --> 00:39:03,718
We take comfort knowing
they're together again,

761
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:06,268
seated at the foot of our Lord.

762
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,385
Let us join together in prayer.

763
00:39:10,409 --> 00:39:12,343
- Hail, Mary...
- ...full of grace,

764
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:15,094
the Lord is with thee.

765
00:39:15,118 --> 00:39:16,885
Blessed art thou among women,

766
00:39:16,909 --> 00:39:20,218
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

767
00:39:20,242 --> 00:39:23,259
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

768
00:39:23,283 --> 00:39:24,927
pray for us sinners,

769
00:39:24,951 --> 00:39:28,184
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

770
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:30,968
Junior, what's the matter?

771
00:39:30,992 --> 00:39:33,343
Oh, this fucking shit!

772
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:35,468
What's the point?

773
00:39:35,492 --> 00:39:36,760
Shh, Uncle Junior.

774
00:39:36,784 --> 00:39:38,684
I can't take it anymore!

775
00:39:39,951 --> 00:39:41,718
Okay. You need
to lower your voice.

776
00:39:41,742 --> 00:39:43,226
Come on.

777
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:46,718
...and forgive us our trespasses

778
00:39:46,742 --> 00:39:50,927
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

779
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:53,343
It's a fucking Emmy.

780
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:55,600
It's gold-plated.

781
00:39:56,617 --> 00:39:58,385
Then melt it down, man.

782
00:39:58,409 --> 00:40:00,094
Look, I told you, $15.

783
00:40:00,118 --> 00:40:02,760
Oh, fuck, man, come on!

784
00:40:02,784 --> 00:40:05,760
This is, like, huge, this shit.

785
00:40:05,784 --> 00:40:07,176
If you had an Oscar,

786
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,135
maybe I could give you
a little something.

787
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:10,385
An Academy Award.

788
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:11,892
But TV?

789
00:40:13,325 --> 00:40:15,802
- What else you got?
- I don't know.

790
00:40:15,826 --> 00:40:18,301
I got a laptop in my car.

791
00:40:18,325 --> 00:40:19,885
Yeah, okay, cool.

792
00:40:19,909 --> 00:40:21,600
I'll check that out.

793
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:38,718
From your friend.

794
00:40:38,742 --> 00:40:40,350
All 1,200.

795
00:40:41,118 --> 00:40:42,385
He give you a hard time?

796
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:45,135
Hardest thing
was keeping him awake.

797
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:47,551
He's hitting the vein.
Nodding out.

798
00:40:47,575 --> 00:40:49,892
Son of a fuckin' bitch.

799
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,684
Cheers.

800
00:40:56,909 --> 00:40:58,475
Mm.

801
00:41:00,076 --> 00:41:02,468
I'm grilling us
some filet mignon.

802
00:41:02,492 --> 00:41:04,725
And you, take a load off.

803
00:41:12,826 --> 00:41:16,385
Here, this is the money from
the closing of the racetrack.

804
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:17,635
It's 150 grand.

805
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:19,802
That's great.

806
00:41:19,826 --> 00:41:21,676
How's your pal Hesh?

807
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,968
Good.

808
00:41:22,992 --> 00:41:24,218
I remember once,

809
00:41:24,242 --> 00:41:27,426
your dad and I
drove down the shore.

810
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,385
Hesh had rented a place
at Point Pleasant.

811
00:41:29,409 --> 00:41:31,718
It was right before Labor Day.

812
00:41:31,742 --> 00:41:35,218
Actually, it was a couple
of months before he died.

813
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,760
We stopped at a liquor store.

814
00:41:36,784 --> 00:41:38,927
He had to pee,
I needed some cigarettes.

815
00:41:38,951 --> 00:41:42,052
And anyway, the man behind
the counter was blind.

816
00:41:42,076 --> 00:41:43,718
Your dad looks at him...

817
00:41:43,742 --> 00:41:45,600
Whoa, wait a minute.

818
00:41:46,534 --> 00:41:48,718
This is after my dad got sick?

819
00:41:48,742 --> 00:41:50,385
Yeah.

820
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:52,510
My dad caught emphysema,
and you kept smoking?

821
00:41:52,534 --> 00:41:54,468
He didn't mind.

822
00:41:54,492 --> 00:41:56,760
He could barely breathe.

823
00:41:56,784 --> 00:41:59,301
We had the oxygen tent
set up right in the house.

824
00:41:59,325 --> 00:42:01,343
I mean, Jesus Christ,
even my mother quit.

825
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:03,510
I offered to stop. I mean...

826
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:06,684
And he didn't want me to.
He was fine with it, really.

827
00:42:07,742 --> 00:42:08,968
All right, whatever.

828
00:42:08,992 --> 00:42:11,135
Finish your story.

829
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:12,593
It was dumb.

830
00:42:12,617 --> 00:42:15,392
Your dad got the guy
to give us some champagne.

831
00:42:25,951 --> 00:42:30,059
Water chestnuts
wrapped in bacon.

832
00:42:30,951 --> 00:42:34,135
And dip them in the duck sauce.

833
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:35,642
All right.

834
00:42:41,534 --> 00:42:43,976
Mm. Delicious.

835
00:42:46,659 --> 00:42:48,184
So, what's in the bag?

836
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,426
Oh.

837
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,475
Yeah, I wanted to show you this, uh...

838
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,343
It's the hat I told you about.

839
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,927
JFK's.

840
00:42:59,951 --> 00:43:02,802
Oh, my goodness.

841
00:43:02,826 --> 00:43:04,433
Look at this.

842
00:43:05,742 --> 00:43:07,218
- May I?
- Yeah.

843
00:43:07,242 --> 00:43:08,725

I met with the Dick Wolf guy.

00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:07,510
They hired some kid from Yale.

855
00:44:07,534 --> 00:44:11,760
Plus, now the money I owe you,

856
00:44:11,784 --> 00:44:14,843
my ex-fucking-wife...

857
00:44:14,867 --> 00:44:18,052
How many times have you shot up?

858
00:44:18,076 --> 00:44:20,052
Five, six.

859
00:44:20,076 --> 00:44:22,426
I thought I had it
under control.

860
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:24,259
I lost it.

861
00:44:24,283 --> 00:44:25,635
You stupid fuck.

862
00:44:25,659 --> 00:44:28,510
You were doing so good.
Now you fucked it all up.

863
00:44:28,534 --> 00:44:30,301
Where do you get the right?

864
00:44:30,325 --> 00:44:31,802
We're in the program.

865
00:44:31,826 --> 00:44:34,343
You're gonna use, why
didn't you call your sponsor?

866
00:44:34,367 --> 00:44:35,802
I couldn't get him.

867
00:44:35,826 --> 00:44:37,517
So why the fuck
didn't you call me?

868
00:44:43,617 --> 00:44:47,309
Yeah, but I don't fucking
live with my mistress.

869
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:50,934
I mean, his fucking slippers?

870
00:44:51,867 --> 00:44:53,350
Go on.

871
00:44:54,575 --> 00:44:56,475
Well, when I left there, I...

872
00:44:58,242 --> 00:45:00,392
started thinking about it.

873
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:06,934
When I was, I don't know,
16 years old...

874
00:45:08,992 --> 00:45:10,301
my son's age...

875
00:45:10,325 --> 00:45:11,927
I came home from school,

876
00:45:11,951 --> 00:45:14,642
and there was this note
from my Aunt Quin.

877
00:45:15,534 --> 00:45:18,218
My mother had been pregnant

878
00:45:18,242 --> 00:45:21,642
with another kid
after my sister Barbara.

879
00:45:22,742 --> 00:45:24,892
Change-of-life baby,
they called it, and...

880
00:45:27,076 --> 00:45:29,226
Well, she started bleeding.

881
00:45:30,575 --> 00:45:33,593
I was supposed find my father
and get him over there ASAP.

882
00:45:33,617 --> 00:45:37,433
I called every number I had.
I left messages all over town.

883
00:45:41,575 --> 00:45:43,259
And finally, that night,

884
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:44,802
about 10:00,

885
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:46,684
he called me back.

886
00:45:51,367 --> 00:45:52,551
Hello?

887
00:45:52,575 --> 00:45:54,802
Anthony, what's the matter?

888
00:45:54,826 --> 00:45:56,426
<i>Ma's in the hospital.</i>

889
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:59,135
<i>I-I think she was--
she was bleeding.</i>

890
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:00,760
<i>The baby.</i>

891
00:46:00,784 --> 00:46:03,017
Jesus Christ.

892
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,850
Oh, shit!

893
00:46:10,283 --> 00:46:11,885
- Okay, pal.
- The lamb chops

894
00:46:11,909 --> 00:46:13,642
are gonna be overcooked.

895
00:46:15,367 --> 00:46:16,968
I'm tied up,

896
00:46:16,992 --> 00:46:19,968
but I'm gonna get over
to the hospital right away.

897
00:46:19,992 --> 00:46:23,184
He came and got me
the next morning.

898
00:46:25,409 --> 00:46:28,052
We went over to the hospital.

899
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,676
Walked into her room.

900
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,385
You're okay, baby, you're okay.

901
00:46:31,409 --> 00:46:33,052
No, you're okay!

902
00:46:33,076 --> 00:46:36,052
Your life is just
so wonderful and okay!

903
00:46:36,076 --> 00:46:37,934
Lee...

904
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:42,684
Where were you last night?

905
00:46:44,992 --> 00:46:46,934
I was at the Yankee game.

906
00:46:47,659 --> 00:46:49,593
You were with that whore.

907
00:46:49,617 --> 00:46:51,301
What do you take me for,
an idiot?

908
00:46:51,325 --> 00:46:53,385
No, Lee, that's not true!

909
00:46:53,409 --> 00:46:56,968
I picked up Anthony from school,
we went to the game.

910
00:46:56,992 --> 00:46:58,426
Nicky gave us the tickets.

911
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:00,426
You're a goddamn liar.

912
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:03,343
I swear to God, Lee,
the car broke down!

913
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:04,968
The timing belt!

914
00:47:04,992 --> 00:47:07,176
We had to stay
at Cousin Jimmy's.

915
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,718
Marone, when we got home
and saw that note,

916
00:47:10,742 --> 00:47:13,094
I was worried sick.

917
00:47:13,118 --> 00:47:15,433
Ask Anthony,
you don't believe me.

918
00:47:20,534 --> 00:47:23,350
Where were you last night,
Anthony?

919
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,725
We were at Cousin Jimmy's, Ma.

920
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:37,725
She could've fuckin' died
from her miscarriage.

921
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,635
Fuck her.

922
00:47:52,659 --> 00:47:55,301
Was there any blame on his part?

923
00:47:55,325 --> 00:47:57,684
This man you emulate?

924
00:47:58,659 --> 00:47:59,968
The lies?

925
00:47:59,992 --> 00:48:02,934
The betrayals with other women?

926
00:48:07,034 --> 00:48:08,676
Listen to me.

927
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,301
This is very important.

928
00:48:10,325 --> 00:48:13,843
Your mother had her faults,
but after all this time,

929
00:48:13,867 --> 00:48:16,259
what should we do
with the old woman?

930
00:48:16,283 --> 00:48:18,593
Have an <i>auto-da-fé?</i>

931
00:48:18,617 --> 00:48:21,268
Burn her at the stake?

932
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:26,976
You need to forgive her
and move on.

933
00:48:34,534 --> 00:48:36,468
She made my father
give my dog away.

934
00:48:36,492 --> 00:48:38,802
I thought your father
was a big, tough guy.

935
00:48:38,826 --> 00:48:41,392
He probably didn't want
to hear her bullshit anymore.

936
00:48:42,742 --> 00:48:45,094
He gave my dog away
to his girlfriend's kid.

937
00:48:45,118 --> 00:48:46,635
Big fuckin' deal.

938
00:48:46,659 --> 00:48:48,080
If it was up to her,

939
00:48:48,604 --> 00:48:50,975
she would have had it killed.

940
00:49:03,492 --> 00:49:05,184
All right, thanks.

941
00:49:07,242 --> 00:49:08,551
Book value's 17 grand.

942
00:49:08,575 --> 00:49:10,725
I'll knock that off
the principal.

943
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:16,301
I fucking love this car.

944
00:49:16,325 --> 00:49:18,767
So you'll get another one.

945
00:49:25,659 --> 00:49:27,392
Is that your sponsor?

946
00:49:30,325 --> 00:49:32,218
I'll see you when
you get out of rehab.

947
00:49:32,242 --> 00:49:34,600
We'll figure out the rest
of the payments.

948
00:49:35,784 --> 00:49:39,510
You can do this, man.
I have faith in you.

949
00:49:39,534 --> 00:49:44,226
There's no chemical solution
to a spiritual problem.

950
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:07,426
It could've been another TIA.
It's hard to tell.

951
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:10,725
Was any of this accompanied
by a lapse in memory?

952
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,385
I don't know.

953
00:50:15,409 --> 00:50:17,809
Had you brought him in right
away, I might have more answers.

954
00:50:17,826 --> 00:50:20,343
That medicine stopped working.

955
00:50:20,367 --> 00:50:22,850
I took more,
and it didn't do shit.

956
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,010
I'm like the walking dead.

957
00:50:25,034 --> 00:50:26,551
Medication's like cooking.

958
00:50:26,575 --> 00:50:28,885
Sometimes we just need
to adjust the ingredients.

959
00:50:28,909 --> 00:50:32,094
Who gives a shit?
I'm so fuckin' blue.

960
00:50:32,118 --> 00:50:33,968
Well, what do you expect?

961
00:50:33,992 --> 00:50:37,184
All you do is go to funerals
all the time.

962
00:50:38,283 --> 00:50:39,968
I'm trapped.

963
00:50:39,992 --> 00:50:41,635
What's the goddamn point?

964
00:50:41,659 --> 00:50:43,475
Goddamn house arrest.

965
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,968
My life is only death.

966
00:50:49,992 --> 00:50:52,433
I'm living in a grave.

967
00:50:54,409 --> 00:50:57,135
I beat prison, and for what?

968
00:50:57,159 --> 00:50:59,017
I have no children.

969
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:03,642
Would somebody please
explain this to me?

970
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:15,142
So, Hesh tells me
you met your dad's goomah.

971
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,392
Yeah.

972
00:51:21,992 --> 00:51:24,309
You had to see this woman
in her prime.

973
00:51:25,534 --> 00:51:26,760
Nice, huh?

974
00:51:26,784 --> 00:51:28,218
Nice?

975
00:51:28,242 --> 00:51:30,802
She was JFK's girlfriend
for, like, three years.

976
00:51:30,826 --> 00:51:32,802
No shit!

977
00:51:32,826 --> 00:51:34,226
Right, I remember
hearing about her.

978
00:51:34,242 --> 00:51:37,176
Fucking knockout.
Beautiful, classy.

979
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,017
JFK, huh?

980
00:51:39,951 --> 00:51:41,642
How do you like that?

981
00:51:42,909 --> 00:51:44,593
Yeah, he'd have her up
to the White House

982
00:51:44,617 --> 00:51:47,559
on the weekends,
when his wife was out of town.

983
00:51:51,492 --> 00:51:53,510
This woman was like a...

984
00:51:53,534 --> 00:51:55,059
like a princess.

985
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:02,094
I'll tell you what.

986
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:03,885
For a while there,

987
00:52:03,909 --> 00:52:07,059
Jackie Kennedy thought
the marriage was over.
