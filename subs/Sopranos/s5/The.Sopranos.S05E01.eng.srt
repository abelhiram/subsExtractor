00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:52,209
<i>Video cameras
with built-in recorders...</i>

171
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,417
<i>Than the car that he qualifi...</i>

172
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,250
<i>- Hello.
- Mmm.</i>

173
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,359
<i>I'm Dr. Lowenstein.</i>

174
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:03,166
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Go back.

175
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,917
What?

176
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:05,876
- Come on.
- You're kidding.

177
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:07,459
No, go back, please!

178
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:09,375
<i>Why don't you come in?</i>

179
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:11,667
- I like Nolte.
<i>- Why didn't you tell me last night?</i>

180
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,625
<i>I'm sorry. That's a long
story. Let's just skip it.</i>

181
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,584
<i>And I'll try to think
of a better one.</i>

182
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:19,917
<i>- What's bothering you?
- Global warming. Acid rain.</i>

183
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:22,417
<i>The national debt. Never
even know what's goin' on.</i>

184
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Look at her nails, totally real.

185
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,959
<i>Let's face it, Lowenstein, women
are more devious than men.</i>

186
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:31,333
One of my therapists
was a woman.

187
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:32,625
Too bad you didn't get

188
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:34,292
all your talkin' done with her.

189
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,042
<i>You expect a man
to be a tower of strength.</i>

190
00:10:37,126 --> 00:10:39,250
<i>Then when it turns out
he's got a few weaknesses</i>

191
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,917
<i>and some insecurities,
what do you do?</i>

192
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:44,459
<i>You turn around and,
goddamn it, you betray him!</i>

193
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:47,333
<i>So you feel that
your mother betrayed you?</i>

194
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:49,168
<i>Oh, God, I hate
this Freudian crap.</i>

195
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,375
<i>And it's not your job to listen
to my problems anyway!</i>

196
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:53,001
<i>And if you don't mind,
I'd like to go.</i>

197
00:10:53,084 --> 00:10:54,959
<i>You're free to leave
anytime you want.</i>

198
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:57,126
<i>Good!</i>

199
00:10:58,168 --> 00:10:59,792
<i>Goddamn shrink.</i>

200
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:02,292
<i>- Who was I kiddin'?</i>
- What are you smiling at?

201
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,584
<i>- I was a champion.</i>
- Nothin'. I don't know.

202
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,917
You have this goofy
little look on your face.

203
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:11,584
- Come on.
<i>- ...until Susan Lowenstein came along.</i>

204
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:16,709
<i>Her questions makin' me
as dizzy as her perfume.</i>

205
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:30,459
- Jennifer Melfi?
- Yes?

206
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:53,042
So we open the fuckin' trunk,

207
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:56,876
this suffocatin' Russian
cocksucker pops up!

208
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,042
He's still alive!

209
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,876
We lead him through the snow.
This asshole's shiverin'.

210
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,542
I mean, he's wearin' fuckin' pajamas
and slippers in like eight-degree weather.

211
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:08,955
Hey!

212
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,834
- Ho! Here he is.
- How you doin'?

213
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:13,168
- Fellas?
- The B?

214
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,500
- Hey, Ton'.
- Radio on the way in.

215
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:17,333
Another fuckin' incident
at the airport.

216
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:19,792
Fuckin' assholes.

217
00:12:19,876 --> 00:12:21,917
I gotta make a couple calls.

218
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:26,001
Anyway, he starts runnin',
the Russian. Boom!

219
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:29,584
I'm tellin' you, the top of his head
came off like a fuckin' bad rug.

220
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,417
What a beating we had
to give this prick.

221
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,250
- Oh, Marone.
- Where's he now, you think?

222
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,750
Who the fuck cares.
Right, Chrissy?

223
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:37,667
- Who the fuck knows?
- Poor bastard.

224
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,459
Never would've happened if
Paulie hadn't initially overreacted,

225
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:42,750
but it's one for the books.

226
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:44,584
What do you mean overreacted?

227
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:46,584
You choked him
with the lamp, Paulie,

228
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,750
or we could've got Silvio's
<i>'scarole</i> without havin'

229
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,417
to spend the night
in the fucking open.

230
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,580
You let him jab you with
that shovel was the problem.

231
00:12:52,584 --> 00:12:53,625
Lets his guard down.

232
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:55,209
We would've caught up
to the prick

233
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:56,917
if you didn't lose
your fuckin' shoe!

234
00:12:57,001 --> 00:12:59,876
Wait, you lost your shoe?

235
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,500
You didn't tell us about that.

236
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:03,542
"Chrissy, please,
don't leave me out here."

237
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,250
You little cocksucker!

238
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,084
I covered your ass with Tony
about that whole thing,

239
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:10,126
and never a word
of fuckin' thanks, ever!

240
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:12,292
Always playin' that
blood-relation card.

241
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,001
- Tony's little favorite.
- Fuck you!

242
00:13:15,084 --> 00:13:16,375
- What?
- Come on!

243
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:18,001
Come on!

244
00:13:18,084 --> 00:13:19,459
What the fuck?

245
00:13:28,584 --> 00:13:30,876
That was a good story, damn it.

246
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,792
Tellin' you right now,
it's finished with us.

247
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:38,375
- Goodbye, Dr. Melfi.
- See you next week.

248
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:48,584
- Hello?
<i>- Like the flowers?</i>

249
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:52,001
<i>And, yeah, before you ask,
I am takin' the medication.</i>

250
00:13:52,084 --> 00:13:53,834
How are you, Anthony?

251
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,250
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

252
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,792
I'm great, actually. You?

253
00:13:57,876 --> 00:14:00,042
<i>Thank you for
that beautiful arrangement.</i>

254
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:02,292
I see you haven't lost
your sense of humor.

255
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,542
Ah, you gotta have a sense
of humor in life, right?

256
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:08,168
- You taught me that.
<i>- And how is life?</i>

257
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,917
Good, good. Well...

258
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:13,750
I'm separated, me and Carmela.

259
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:16,459
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Don't be.

260
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:19,500
Well, I always thought
I saw some good things there.

261
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:21,917
Two healthy kids.
Other than that...

262
00:14:22,401 --> 00:14:24,584
<i>Look, the reason I called,</i>

263
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:26,876
I'd like you to
have dinner with me.

264
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,542
<i>Since we're not
in therapy no more,</i>

265
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:29,834
<i>and I'm a bachelor again...</i>

266
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:32,292
That's very thoughtful of you.

267
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:36,792
Unfortunately, because of
our prior clinical relationship,

268
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,375
- I just can't do it.
<i>- What, eat?</i>

269
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:42,168
- You must be a toothpick.
- You know what I mean.

270
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,876
See, I knew you were gonna
say somethin' like that.

271
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,500
I can't, Anthony, I'm sorry.

272
00:14:50,584 --> 00:14:53,168
You know, I waited
a respectable period or whatever

273
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,750
before makin' this call.

274
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:56,625
Well, then you realize yourself

275
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:59,209
there's something not
quite right about us dating.

276
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:03,001
No, I'm not undeterred by this.
We will talk again.

277
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:06,542
- Thank you for the flowers.
<i>- And the detergent.</i>

278
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,001
And the detergent.

279
00:15:08,084 --> 00:15:10,584
<i>Of course, what's wrong with me?</i>

280
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:11,755
I don't know,

281
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:13,375
<i>but we'll find out.</i>

282
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:15,625
Leave it to Dr. Tony.

283
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:42,876
- What's the matter?
- The bear! Stay there!

284
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:56,333
Oh, right, lock the door.

285
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:58,297
What do you think,
he's gonna wipe his feet too?

286
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,250
He'll smash through the glass.

287
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,667
Now, where is that guy's card?

288
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,042
I don't know.

289
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,542
<i>You have reached Fish and Game.</i>

290
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,333
<i>If you know the extension,
press it now.</i>

291
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:22,834
Unbelievable.

292
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,168
Hello?

293
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,126
<i>For hunting and
fishing licenses, press two.</i>

294
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:32,889
You get a letter
from my cousin in the can?

295
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:34,126
Yes, Officer Zmuida, hi.

296
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:35,689
Yes, Mrs. Soprano
from North Caldwell?

297
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:37,750
We had the bear
in our yard the other night.

298
00:16:37,834 --> 00:16:39,791
- What the fuck?
<i>- You're the guys with the pool, right?</i>

299
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,417
- Yes, it came back.
<i>- Was anybody hurt?</i>

300
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,417
- No, thank God.
<i>- Property damage?</i>

301
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,667
No. No, property damage
either I could see,

302
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,667
but I didn't really
wanna go out there.

303
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,667
Oh, one of those
eastern black bears?

304
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,168
<i>We should be up
in about an hour.</i>

305
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,667
Yes, that'd be great.
Okay, we'll be here.

306
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,001
<i>All right, see you then.</i>

307
00:16:55,084 --> 00:16:56,792
Jesus Christ,
when did this happen?

308
00:16:56,876 --> 00:16:59,500
The first time Sunday night,
and I saw it again just now.

309
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:02,544
A.J. didn't even mention it to you when
you two went to the game yesterday?

310
00:17:02,584 --> 00:17:03,750
No!

311
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:06,459
I have to warn the Cusamanos.

312
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:08,792
They keep Esterhaz chained up
along the side there.

313
00:17:08,876 --> 00:17:11,168
That bear will rip him
to pieces.

314
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,792
Cusamanos weren't home.
Got the machine.

315
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:22,959
Well, I don't see Esterhaz.

316
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:28,209
Why didn't you call me
when this first happened?

317
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:30,375
I called the cops.
They called Fish and Game.

318
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:32,291
What, are you tryin'
to prove you're independent?

319
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:34,083
This isn't Little House
on the fucking Prairie.

320
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:36,375
- Those things are dangerous.
- The ranger, whatever...

321
00:17:36,459 --> 00:17:38,750
said it was your duck food
out there that attracted it.

322
00:17:41,168 --> 00:17:43,333
I never heard
of that happening before.

323
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:45,333
Trapper Joe over here.

324
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:58,733
- We didn't find a spoor.
- I was just tellin' the gentleman

325
00:17:58,757 --> 00:18:01,333
the animal still doesn't meet
the parameters for removal.

326
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:04,333
- Oh, jeez.
- So, when somebody's leg is gone...

327
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,750
Problem is, it hasn't
really threatened anybody.

328
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,417
Sorry.

329
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:20,250
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, hold on a minute.

330
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,625
You and your pal buy some new
lanyards for your whistles.

331
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:27,709
Oh, we can't accept that.
And we don't have whistles.

332
00:18:27,792 --> 00:18:29,584
Thanks, though.

333
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:39,917
Ranger Rick's a little light
in the Timberlands, huh?

334
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:42,042
Everybody's always gay with you.

335
00:18:42,126 --> 00:18:44,542
He's a good-looking guy,
that's all.

336
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:54,834
I already put the ammonia
on the cans, I told you.

337
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:18,542
Look, I came here to give you
your money, but...

338
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:22,750
this bear thing, though,
I'm... I'm worried.

339
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:26,168
- You and A.J. here by yourselves.
- What can we do?

340
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,667
You want coffee?

341
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,250
Last time it had a weird taste.

342
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,084
The coffeemaker is shot.

343
00:19:33,168 --> 00:19:34,917
The heating element
is corroded, I told you.

344
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:37,000
That's not the problem. You
don't need another one of those.

345
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:39,168
Last month, it was
the upstairs toilet. <i>Basta</i>.

346
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:43,417
He goes down the street
to Willow Drive too.

347
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,542
Maybe he'll stay down there.

348
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:50,001
All right, look, you and A.J.,
you check yourself into a hotel

349
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:51,500
till this thing blows over.

350
00:19:51,584 --> 00:19:53,500
Here's $1,200 extra
on top of our agreement.

351
00:19:53,584 --> 00:19:55,959
- I'm not going to a hotel.
- Why not?

352
00:19:56,042 --> 00:19:58,842
- I don't wanna break Anthony's routines.
- He'll get a kick out of it.

353
00:19:58,876 --> 00:20:02,542
It's an adventure. And God
knows he loves room service.

354
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,459
Yeah, I'll give him room service.
The end of my foot.

355
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:08,750
What's with the attitude?

356
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,417
Well, he's an asshole,
that's what.

357
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,750
- So what? It's his age.
- Yeah, thank you, I know.

358
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:15,750
But you buy him too much stuff,

359
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:17,917
I think because you feel
guilty about the separation.

360
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:20,834
Excuse me. It wasn't my idea.

361
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:23,042
There is more than one way
to ask for something.

362
00:20:23,126 --> 00:20:24,417
Could we please not?

363
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,959
Spend $5,000 on a set of drums.

364
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:29,500
But SAT tutor, coffeemaker,

365
00:20:29,584 --> 00:20:31,292
I gotta fight you
tooth and nail.

366
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,416
All I said was I wanna see
statements from the tutor,

367
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:34,917
or he doesn't get paid!

368
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:37,333
He's a college kid, Tony,
he's not set up for that.

369
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:39,792
You worried he's gonna
soak you for an extra pencil?

370
00:20:39,876 --> 00:20:42,250
Oh, rimshot!

371
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,001
What I think, Tony, is you're
trying to make my life now

372
00:20:45,084 --> 00:20:47,126
as hard on me financially
as possible.

373
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:49,792
- Oh, it should be easy.
- Unbelievable.

374
00:20:49,876 --> 00:20:52,209
What do you think, you're the
only Catholic here, Carmela?

375
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,584
I'm old school.
I don't believe in this

376
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:56,292
separation shit and divorce,

377
00:20:56,375 --> 00:21:01,042
even if my wife was going after
some fuckin' immigrant!

378
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:04,084
Yet you are modern enough
to use a cell phone to call Italy

379
00:21:04,168 --> 00:21:06,667
and every other fucking
place to threaten the guy's life.

380
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,084
Oh, that's right.

381
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:11,500
Certain people
see him, he's a dead man.

382
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:13,917
He had coffee here, Tony,
that's all.

383
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:15,876
And now the coffeemaker sucks.

384
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,667
How you like them apples?

385
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:23,500
You don't wanna stay at
a hotel, you suit yourself.

386
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:30,667
<i>This is Anthony.</i>

387
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:35,168
<i>Could you call me
at 973-555-1299?</i>

388
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:40,792
<i>I'm thinking maybe I gotta come
back, you know, for therapy.</i>

389
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:44,292
- Smells good, Feech.
- Yeah?

390
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:48,126
- You want a taste?
- Nah, I'll wait.

391
00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:52,959
No offense, kid, but don't look
to me like you do a lot of waiting.

392
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:54,417
Just like his old man, huh?

393
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,542
Lot of changes
since you went away, huh?

394
00:21:57,325 --> 00:21:59,300
Twenty years. Marone.

395
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:00,917
You know what the biggest
change for me is?

396
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:03,250
Broads shaving their bushes.

397
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,834
I went over to Silvio's, it's
like the Girl Scouts over there.

398
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:09,375
I think I'll
let this simmer a bit.

399
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:13,126
Must be different in the can
now, not like the old days.

400
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:14,459
Fuckin' animals.

401
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:18,250
It's all about
setting a precedent.

402
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,417
First day there,
I walk in the mess,

403
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,625
I'm wearin' a puss,
a fuckin' scowl.

404
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:26,168
I look around...

405
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,750
My nephew.

406
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,333
Right in the middle of my story!

407
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:32,417
There he is!

408
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:34,084
The man, the legend,

409
00:22:34,168 --> 00:22:35,500
Feech La Manna.

410
00:22:35,584 --> 00:22:39,750
Hey, my God, look at you!
You big galoot!

411
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:42,042
What'd you, go straight
from the joint to Earl Scheib?

412
00:22:42,126 --> 00:22:45,625
Look at this fucking tan.

413
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:48,250
You close the cellar door
when you came up?

414
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,500
It's like the Bowery Boys in
here with this house arrest here.

415
00:22:51,584 --> 00:22:53,625
Code words and secret passages.

416
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:56,042
- He's in the middle of a story.
- When isn't he?

417
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:58,001
Hey.

418
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:03,250
It's day one, I'm in the mess,

419
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:06,542
I look around
and I spot the biggest,

420
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:09,375
blackest motherfucker
that I can find.

421
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:12,333
Everybody's looking at me, and
I walk right up to him and I say,

422
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:14,375
"What the fuck are you
looking at?"

423
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:15,750
He says, "What?"

424
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:18,209
I said,
"You heard me, motherfucker.

425
00:23:18,292 --> 00:23:20,292
What the fuck
are you looking at?!"

426
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:21,667
With that, I hit him! Bam!

427
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,333
Right across
the fucking coconut!

428
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:25,667
He goes down, I'm on top
of him. Everybody around!

429
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,333
He gets some shots in!
Everybody's going fuckin' crazy!

430
00:23:29,417 --> 00:23:31,625
The screws, these guys,
everybody!

431
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:34,084
"Motherfucker!"

432
00:23:34,168 --> 00:23:36,834
From that time on...

433
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:39,042
Nobody so much as looks
at me cross-eyed!

434
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:42,375
Well, welcome home, huh?

435
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:44,876
- Welcome home.
- Welcome home.

436
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:51,042
Reason I wanted to see you,
Junior, Tony too,

437
00:23:51,126 --> 00:23:54,168
now that I'm out, I'd like
to get back in the game.

438
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,209
What'd you have in mind?

439
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:57,792
You know me,
I'm an entrepreneur.

440
00:23:57,876 --> 00:24:00,709
Get my shy going, sports book,

441
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:02,001
whatever you say.

442
00:24:06,542 --> 00:24:08,876
As long as you don't step
on anybody's toes.

443
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:11,834
Me? I'm Fred Astaire.

444
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:20,375
What's this Feech tells me, you
got a bear up there at the house?

445
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,375
What's it, on fucking CNN?

446
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:25,750
No, it's just
that your wife's up there,

447
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:27,459
and the kids,
your ex-wife, whatever.

448
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:29,959
It's just that wild animals,
they're dangerous.

449
00:24:30,042 --> 00:24:32,042
- People talk.
- What people?

450
00:24:32,126 --> 00:24:34,333
- Who?
- I don't know.

451
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,255
What am I supposed to do,
go up there personally

452
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:43,250
and set fucking bear traps?

453
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,292
We're separated, for chrissake.

454
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,084
So where's the dinner at?

455
00:24:56,168 --> 00:24:59,625
Oh, I forget the name.
It's in the car.

456
00:24:59,709 --> 00:25:01,042
Who's gonna be there?

457
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:03,042
What are you,
on the school paper?

458
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,542
Guys. Business.

459
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:10,625
- You got any cash?
- Some.

460
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:11,876
Hand me my bag.

461
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:22,168
- That's all you got?
- It's like $400.

462
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:25,001
I'm low man tonight,
I gotta pay for everybody.

463
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:27,041
You know, this is fucking
ridiculous, Christopher.

464
00:25:27,042 --> 00:25:30,625
Why should you get stuck all the
time? You should make Paulie pay.

465
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:33,292
What, I make the rules now?
Guy's a captain.

466
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:36,001
I know,
but when he was in jail...

467
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:39,542
All's I'm saying is if you
get the extra responsibilities,

468
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,592
you should get the benefits too.

469
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,959
You're right.

470
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:48,917
I'll say hello
to the guys from you.

471
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:09,042
Benny, hi! Come on in.

472
00:26:10,084 --> 00:26:11,333
Tony sent me.

473
00:26:11,417 --> 00:26:12,791
He says he wants somebody
stationed in the yard.

474
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:14,417
He's worried the bear
might come back.

475
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,042
What? No, I don't want this.

476
00:26:16,126 --> 00:26:18,667
Well, we'll switch off,
me and Paulie Germani.

477
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,667
This is silly.
I'm gonna call him.

478
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,750
Actually,
it's not that silly, Mrs. S.

479
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:26,001
If it was my family, I'd wanna know
there was a male at the house too.

480
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,959
What can you do about it
if it does come back?

481
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:29,750
Tony said you
should unlock the closet

482
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:31,667
and give me the "shkoopet,"
he called it.

483
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,584
- Oh, for God's sake.
- We'll call the Fish and Game too.

484
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:37,375
It's just I'll have
the weapon in case.

485
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:40,959
He's just worried about you,
that's all. And Anthony.

486
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:45,834
Well, okay. I don't know. I...

487
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,959
You're very nice to do this.

488
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:51,126
Nice got nothing to do with it.

489
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:54,667
Stay inside. You don't have to sit
out there like A Fistful of Dollars.

490
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,084
Tony said not in the house.

491
00:26:56,168 --> 00:26:58,042
I got my little Sony in the car.

492
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:03,958
You want something to eat?
We were just about to sit down.

493
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:06,375
Nah, I'm good.
I just stopped at Tio Pepe's.

494
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,042
This freaking olive oil.

495
00:27:12,126 --> 00:27:14,750
The food's drenched.
That's the reason it happened.

496
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,750
As far as fucking bears
are concerned,

497
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:18,667
I say get rid of them all.

498
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,750
They had their turn,
and now we got ours.

499
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:23,375
That's why dinosaurs
don't exist no more.

500
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:25,709
- Wasn't it a meteor?
- They're all meat eaters.

501
00:27:25,792 --> 00:27:29,042
- Meteor, meteor.
- Take it easy.

502
00:27:29,126 --> 00:27:32,042
Gentlemen,
whenever you're ready.

503
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:40,168
- All right, are we set?
- Yeah, sure.

504
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:43,117
What are you doing, you ready?

505
00:27:43,168 --> 00:27:45,001
I gotta make a pit stop.

506
00:27:45,084 --> 00:27:47,625
Eh, you forgetting something?

507
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:51,084
You get it. I got the last one.

508
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,292
Here, baby,
have some more cheesecake.

509
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:56,250
The other thing with bears is,
if you're ever chased by one,

510
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:57,667
run downhill.

511
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,168
Some reason, they can't do that.

512
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,542
It's the moss.

513
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:03,542
They attack when you're
having your period too.

514
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,792
No, no, that's jungle cats.

515
00:28:05,876 --> 00:28:07,917
- So can we go?
- Hold your horses.

516
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:11,667
- What's goin' on, we ready or what?
- Yeah.

517
00:28:17,042 --> 00:28:19,625
- Fine, I'll get it.
- Gimme the fucking thing.

518
00:28:19,709 --> 00:28:22,917
- I said I'll get it.
- Enough. It's done.

519
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:46,042
- $860.
- What?

520
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:48,667
You heard me. That's what
you owe from last night.

521
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,959
You said you got it.

522
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:52,834
I only got, like,
a hundred bucks on me, anyways.

523
00:28:52,917 --> 00:28:56,667
Then get the rest by tonight
or you start paying points.

524
00:29:02,084 --> 00:29:04,667
I'm thinking of going
for the acupuncture.

525
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,459
What, your shoulder again?

526
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:08,542
Those long drives.
It's already tender.

527
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:10,709
Next time, we get you
out there, Angelo.

528
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:14,209
After 18 years in the can,
I'm just happy to be outside.

529
00:29:14,292 --> 00:29:16,292
What, they don't have
a golf course at Leavenworth?

530
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:20,375
Still a smart ass, this one.

531
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:24,126
Carmine, you all right? You
barely touched your egg salad.

532
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:26,333
Too much gherkins.

533
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:28,500
- You smell that?
- What?

534
00:29:28,584 --> 00:29:29,792
Burning hair.

535
00:29:29,876 --> 00:29:31,959
I smell cut grass.

536
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:35,209
Any word on your cousin
getting out?

537
00:29:35,292 --> 00:29:38,209
- Who's your cousin again?
- Tony Blundetto.

538
00:29:38,292 --> 00:29:40,375
Oh, yeah, good guy.
Right, right.

539
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:42,209
He was my best buddy inside.

540
00:29:42,292 --> 00:29:44,126
So you gonna give him a party?

541
00:29:44,209 --> 00:29:46,542
When he gets home, get him laid.

542
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:49,126
What's the matter, Carmine?

543
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:50,250
- Carmine?
- Jesus Christ!

544
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:51,533
- Carmine!
- Call an ambulance.

545
00:29:51,584 --> 00:29:53,876
- Yes, sir.
- Is he breathing?

546
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,417
Get that egg salad
out of his mouth.

547
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,333
Hurry up!

548
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:08,625
Lupertazzi residence.

549
00:30:08,709 --> 00:30:09,917
<i>Carmine, it's John.</i>

550
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:12,375
Hey, John boy,
how's the weather?

551
00:30:12,459 --> 00:30:14,042
Look, I got some bad news.

552
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:16,084
Your dad's had a stroke.

553
00:30:16,168 --> 00:30:18,542
- Oh, my God, how bad?
<i>- There's some paralysis.</i>

554
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:21,065
It's too early to tell yet.
They're doing everything they can.

555
00:30:21,084 --> 00:30:23,459
- Is my mom there?
<i>- I just called her, she's on her way.</i>

556
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:25,584
We're over at St. Vincent's.

557
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:28,876
Anything, John, anything he
needs. I'm on the next plane.

558
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:32,042
Sad, this shit, huh?

559
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,625
I wonder if I can smoke in here.

560
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:43,209
You know, I haven't forgotten
our arrangement last year,

561
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:45,250
you leaving me
in the lurch like that.

562
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,168
It was the right thing
to do, John.

563
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,834
Taking out a boss? Come on.

564
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:51,209
- Even still.
- What do you want, an apology?

565
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:53,292
Fucking Whitman Sampler, what?

566
00:30:59,084 --> 00:31:02,292
Boy, imagine if his
fucking speech is affected.

567
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:03,542
Poor bastard.

568
00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:17,750
So when you're up at the house,
who comes to visit? Anybody?

569
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:21,333
Mostly Rosalie Aprile,
Sil's wife.

570
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:22,792
Who calls on the phone?

571
00:31:22,876 --> 00:31:25,042
Most of the calls
seem to be for Anthony.

572
00:32:12,126 --> 00:32:13,375
So...?

573
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:19,042
Look, the real reason I'm here

574
00:32:19,126 --> 00:32:22,292
is to confront you
in a positive way

575
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:27,292
about taking our relationship
in that other direction.

576
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:30,250
Why did you have
to be underhanded?

577
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:32,250
I don't find
that appealing, frankly.

578
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:34,542
I was gonna ask you out
for coffee or something,

579
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:36,292
but I didn't think you'd go.

580
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:38,959
I'll pay for the hour,
that goes without saying.

581
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:40,333
Forget that.

582
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:43,667
I was listening
to that guy on TV, Dr. Phil?

583
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,292
And he was talking
about a similar situation,

584
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:49,625
and he said that you could
if you wanted to.

585
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:53,126
There's no set rules. It's
basically about malpractice,

586
00:32:53,209 --> 00:32:55,042
and you probably
couldn't get sued.

587
00:32:55,126 --> 00:32:56,459
That's not the point.

588
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,500
Look, I was thinking
about all kinds of moves.

589
00:33:09,042 --> 00:33:10,292
Buy her a piece of jewelry.

590
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:11,935
Pay the guy to close down
the restaurant

591
00:33:12,001 --> 00:33:13,749
where she eats lunch
and hire a mandolin player.

592
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,375
This is the place
where we've been

593
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:18,792
most honest with each other.

594
00:33:18,876 --> 00:33:21,667
And that's the way
I always liked it.

595
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,459
So that being said,

596
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:26,584
if you don't like me personally,

597
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:29,250
or the cut of my jib,
or my face, or whatever,

598
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:33,417
then the matter will end here,
and I will never ask you again.

599
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,917
You can be honest.

600
00:33:40,209 --> 00:33:42,001
I like you, Anthony.

601
00:33:42,084 --> 00:33:44,333
And, no,
you have a very nice face.

602
00:33:44,417 --> 00:33:46,126
Working on the weight,
too, by the way.

603
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:47,292
Good.

604
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:51,625
Explain to me, okay,

605
00:33:51,709 --> 00:33:55,792
why this is a matter
of such importance to you.

606
00:33:55,876 --> 00:33:57,917
There must be plenty
of women out there.

607
00:33:58,001 --> 00:34:00,126
You're different
from what's out there,

608
00:34:00,209 --> 00:34:02,375
not to mention being
drop-dead beautiful.

609
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:05,667
My training teaches me to go
fairly quickly

610
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,333
to the idea that
what you really want

611
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:09,750
is to come back to therapy.

612
00:34:09,834 --> 00:34:12,375
Jesus Christ Almighty,
come on, will ya!

613
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:15,876
Your marriage of 20-something
years has collapsed.

614
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:17,792
No doubt there are issues
with your children.

615
00:34:17,876 --> 00:34:21,375
Why can't I do something
that's just for me for a change?

616
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:22,792
It would be for you.

617
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:26,625
All right, well, I want you.

618
00:34:26,709 --> 00:34:28,876
And not just for
the smart things you say.

619
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:31,834
I want... I want your skin.

620
00:34:31,917 --> 00:34:34,209
I want your mouth.

621
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:36,209
I want your eyes.

622
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:41,042
You project all these
qualities onto me.

623
00:34:41,126 --> 00:34:42,584
You don't know me.

624
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:46,417
This is what happens
between doctor and patient.

625
00:34:58,333 --> 00:34:59,959
Don't do that.

626
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:17,834
Out of respect for this office.

627
00:35:22,542 --> 00:35:25,876
You know, forget about the way that
Tony Soprano makes his way in the world.

628
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:28,876
That's just
to feed his children.

629
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,709
There's two Tony Sopranos.

630
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:32,792
You've never seen the other one.

631
00:35:32,876 --> 00:35:35,001
That's the one
I wanna show to you.

632
00:36:17,584 --> 00:36:19,625
- Hi.
- Hi. I, uh...

633
00:36:19,709 --> 00:36:21,667
I wonder
if I could use the W.C.?

634
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,667
- Of course, come on in.
- Yeah, okay.

635
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:28,959
- Is it cold out?
- Yeah, a little, but I got a fleece, so...

636
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:53,500
I know him. He'll just keep
coming back and coming back.

637
00:36:53,584 --> 00:36:55,459
How to let him down easy, I...

638
00:36:55,542 --> 00:36:57,102
You think it's worth
telling the police?

639
00:36:57,126 --> 00:37:00,959
What? Jesus, Elliot.

640
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:03,042
I don't want to paint
in somber tones here,

641
00:37:03,126 --> 00:37:05,042
but the man is a sociopath,

642
00:37:05,126 --> 00:37:07,417
unpracticed in not
getting what he wants.

643
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,209
And now, since
the therapy is kaput,

644
00:37:10,292 --> 00:37:13,084
what use are you
to him except for sex?

645
00:37:13,168 --> 00:37:15,001
Thank you, Elliot.

646
00:37:15,084 --> 00:37:19,168
Your depth of feeling is
really quite extraordinary here.

647
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,001
All you could come up with

648
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:23,709
was this weak borscht
about professional ethics,

649
00:37:23,792 --> 00:37:25,084
because you are worried

650
00:37:25,168 --> 00:37:27,709
about how this thug
will handle rejection.

651
00:37:29,168 --> 00:37:34,584
You know, at first I
did find him a little sexy,

652
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:37,042
dangerous alpha male.

653
00:37:37,126 --> 00:37:38,667
But as year followed year,

654
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:42,459
the ugliness I saw, I heard...

655
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:45,042
You kept him
a long time, though.

656
00:37:45,126 --> 00:37:50,042
There's a mutual sympathy
there of some kind, I guess.

657
00:37:50,126 --> 00:37:52,333
Maybe it's just
the Italian thing.

658
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:05,584
Sil said you
were looking for me?

659
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:07,250
Sit down.

660
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,209
This about the Easter baskets?

661
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,667
I don't even know what that is,

662
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,459
and, to tell you the truth,
I don't wanna know.

663
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:20,500
Now what's this shit
between you and Paulie?

664
00:38:20,584 --> 00:38:22,001
You chiseled him
out of a dinner?

665
00:38:22,084 --> 00:38:24,667
I chiseled him? He said that?

666
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,959
I asked you a question.

667
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:29,209
Can I say something
in my own defense?

668
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:31,250
It's not right that
I have to pay all the time.

669
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:34,375
I've been paying
for fucking years.

670
00:38:34,459 --> 00:38:35,459
You done?

671
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:37,625
Good.

672
00:38:37,709 --> 00:38:39,001
You pay till I tell you

673
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:41,042
you don't have to pay no more.

674
00:38:41,126 --> 00:38:43,459
And don't give me that face.

675
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:46,167
You know how many tabs, how many
dinners I picked up over the years?

676
00:38:46,168 --> 00:38:49,126
I got Richie Aprile,
fat fucking Gerry Anastasia.

677
00:38:49,209 --> 00:38:51,584
Those guys killed me
at Benihana's.

678
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:55,333
And forget it-- they want a steak,
I put a new wing on Peter Luger's.

679
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,459
Brandy, cigars, champagne.

680
00:38:57,542 --> 00:38:59,709
Could've bought a fucking plane.

681
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:01,466
I hear you, Ton', but that was

682
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,875
- before inflation.
- Whatever.

683
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:06,750
I-It's tradition.

684
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:08,584
It's like in ancient times,
the samurais,

685
00:39:08,667 --> 00:39:13,168
they had these pages, young
boys that did their errands,

686
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,084
washed their clothes,
shit like that.

687
00:39:15,168 --> 00:39:16,667
It's a sign of respect.

688
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,042
Why don't you cheer up?

689
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:23,917
One day, some kid'll
be paying for your dinners.

690
00:39:26,459 --> 00:39:29,500

Yeah, yeah. I'm just,

- Not for me.

00:40:07,084 --> 00:40:09,333
I been enjoying looking
at youse the whole night.

707
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,876
Get some fuckin' glasses.

708
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:14,250
We gotta go.

709
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:16,792
All right, I'll see you
over at the $100 table.

710

Ton', you sure you're all right?

711
00:40:26,168 --> 00:40:27,792
You got a big moose on.

712
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:35,917
It's a fucking broad,
believe that?

713
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:37,500
Really? You mean...?

714
00:40:37,584 --> 00:40:40,250
- It's the real deal, I think.
- No shit, huh?

715
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:43,876
See, the thing is,

She thinks that's
what it is, but it's not,

719
00:40:51,876 --> 00:40:54,584
and no amount of convincing
will change her mind.

720
00:40:56,292 --> 00:41:00,917
- So she was a friend.
- Yeah.

721
00:41:02,834 --> 00:41:05,584
They're wrapping up a lobster
roll for me to take to Ginny.

- Yeah.

00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,375
- Anything else, gentlemen?
- We're good.

724
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:17,126
My friend here'll
take the check, though.

725
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:18,876

yourself? Save a little money.

- No, why don't you tell me?

the shrimp fucking cocktails
you made everybody get!

740
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:08,084
Then on top of everything else, you
send those skanks a bottle of Cristal?

741
00:42:08,168 --> 00:42:10,834
I was being a gentleman,
Chrissy. You oughta try it some time.

Not to mention the Lyonnaise
fuckin' potatoes you didn't even touch!

743
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:17,276
- What?! I lost my appetite.
- Fuck you!

744
00:42:17,759 --> 00:42:19,792
- Excuse me?
- You fuckin' heard me!

745
00:42:19,876 --> 00:42:22,959
I'm telling you, Chrissy, I don't give
a fuck anymore who you're related to.

746
00:42:23,042 --> 00:42:27,834
Go ahead, Paulie! Go for it.
Your big fuckin' moment!

747
00:42:27,917 --> 00:42:30,209
- You little fuck!
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

748
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:32,333
Was there a problem
with the service?

749
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:35,292
- What are you talking about?
- You left me $16, sir.

750
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:38,834
- Perhaps you miscounted.
- There's 1,200 bucks in there.

751
00:42:38,917 --> 00:42:42,667
That's correct,
and the bill was $1,184.

752
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:45,505
Assuming you don't tip on
tax or alcohol, 15 percent--

753
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:46,542
I'm tapped out.

754
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:51,001
You think this job is easy?
I have kids.

755
00:42:51,084 --> 00:42:53,250
Then go back inside
before you get hurt.

756
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:55,333
I have a goddamn family
to support.

757
00:42:55,417 --> 00:42:57,333
- Fuck off!
- Yeah, right.

758
00:42:57,417 --> 00:43:01,333
Go piss it away at blackjack,
fucking assholes!

759
00:43:01,417 --> 00:43:02,959
Oh!

760
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:09,709
What do you gotta say now?

761
00:43:13,709 --> 00:43:15,792
Chrissy, he's fucked up.

762
00:43:15,876 --> 00:43:20,250
Don't they have medicine they're
supposed to take, these assholes?

763
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:22,584
I don't know.

764
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:24,209
He'll say we hit him
with a brick.

765
00:43:24,292 --> 00:43:26,834
He's still going, this asshole.

766
00:43:33,459 --> 00:43:35,959
That's my money, Paulie!

767
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:09,209
How's he doing?

768
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:12,001
I love him so much,
and I can't do shit.

769
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:18,584
We're all praying for him.

770
00:44:22,834 --> 00:44:25,375
You know, you were
another son to him.

771
00:44:38,126 --> 00:44:40,459
- Yeah?
- You get some sleep?

772
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:43,375
<i>- A little, you know.</i>
- Fucked up, huh?

773
00:44:43,459 --> 00:44:45,250
What are you gonna do?

774
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:47,292
I'm not too worried
about the cops.

775
00:44:47,375 --> 00:44:49,001
Nobody knows us down there.

776
00:44:50,792 --> 00:44:52,001
<i>The reason I called.</i>

777
00:44:52,084 --> 00:44:53,625
Let's bury the hatchet,
you and me.

778
00:44:53,709 --> 00:44:55,500
All this bullshit with us.

779
00:44:55,584 --> 00:44:58,834
- I know, I know, it's stupid.
<i>- Life's too short, Chrissy.</i>

780
00:44:58,917 --> 00:45:01,292
You can't waste it
fighting with your friends.

781
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:03,209
Look what could've
happened last night.

782
00:45:03,292 --> 00:45:04,917
<i>One of us could've got hurt,</i>

783
00:45:05,001 --> 00:45:06,750
or even killed, for chrissake.

784
00:45:06,834 --> 00:45:09,792
- I know.
<i>- You're special to me, you know.</i>

785
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:11,292
Always have been.

786
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,667
You, too, Paulie, to me.

787
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:16,476
We'll split the tab.

788
00:45:17,168 --> 00:45:20,709
- I'm sorry, Paulie.
- I apologize too, kid.

789
00:45:20,792 --> 00:45:22,834
<i>I'll talk to you later.</i>

790
00:45:32,459 --> 00:45:37,667
When you say that, you
make me feel... less than.

791
00:45:41,792 --> 00:45:43,667
Next week, everyone.

792
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:55,750
Good luck.

793
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:59,250
I'm going outta town next week.

794
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:00,750
Okay.

795
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:03,500
Good night.

796
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:10,834
Anthony.

797
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,168
- Hello.
- Hey.

798
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,375
A friend of mine had these.

799
00:46:21,459 --> 00:46:23,126
I'll see you next week.

800
00:46:27,709 --> 00:46:31,168
Like I was saying, a friend of
mine had these and couldn't use 'em.

801
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,834
I figured, well, maybe we could.

802
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,250
Tickets. Bermuda.

803
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:39,459
Lodging at
the Elbow Beach Hotel.

804
00:46:42,459 --> 00:46:45,333
I turned down
a wonderful dinner invitation,

805
00:46:45,417 --> 00:46:48,625
and you think
I'll go away with you?

806
00:46:48,709 --> 00:46:51,208
Well, the guy couldn't use 'em
and, you know, he gave 'em to me.

807
00:46:51,209 --> 00:46:53,001
What do you want me to do,
throw 'em away?

808
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:58,792
Come on, I'm breaking out
the big guns here.

809
00:47:00,292 --> 00:47:02,834
You're turning me
into half a stalker.

810
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,333
Listen, Anthony, I'm...

811
00:47:08,417 --> 00:47:11,250
I'm not going to go out
with you, okay?

812
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:13,542
And it's not
because you're unattractive,

813
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:15,500
or I don't think
I would have a good time.

814
00:47:15,584 --> 00:47:18,126
It's just something
I'm not going to do.

815
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:21,126
And I would like you
to respect my decision

816
00:47:21,209 --> 00:47:25,584
and just try to feel that
I know what's right for me.

817
00:47:28,917 --> 00:47:30,333
Okay?

818
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:44,001
But it's not just the
psychiatric ethics stuff, is it?

819
00:47:44,084 --> 00:47:46,333
I wanna preserve
the option for you

820
00:47:46,417 --> 00:47:50,542
that you could always come
back to our work, if you wish,

821
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:53,168
and that we could pick up
where we've left off.

822
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:55,876
I don't think you get this.
I want you!

823
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:57,584
And that's very
flattering to me.

824
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:59,333
I'm not interested
in flattering you.

825
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:00,834
I know you're not.

826
00:48:00,917 --> 00:48:03,876
All right, then what is it?
Okay, what is it?

827
00:48:03,959 --> 00:48:07,959
Just help me
understand it, okay?

828
00:48:12,459 --> 00:48:15,709
You know, Anthony,
during therapy I...

829
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:19,042
I never judged you
or your behavior.

830
00:48:19,126 --> 00:48:21,042
It's not the place
of a therapist to do so.

831
00:48:21,126 --> 00:48:23,584
All right, I get all this.
Go, go.

832
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:27,250
In a personal relationship,

833
00:48:27,333 --> 00:48:29,417
I don't think
I could sit silent.

834
00:48:31,459 --> 00:48:33,459
About what?

835
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,001
Our values are...

836
00:48:38,084 --> 00:48:39,417
just very different.

837
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,001
- You don't like my values?
- Honestly?

838
00:48:42,084 --> 00:48:43,126
Yeah.

839
00:48:45,001 --> 00:48:46,001
No.

840
00:48:50,126 --> 00:48:52,625
Okay. Like what?

841
00:48:54,084 --> 00:48:56,584
- It's getting late, I...
- No, no, no.

842
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,834
Come on. It's okay, it's okay.

843
00:49:02,917 --> 00:49:07,042
Well, you're not
a truthful person.

844
00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:10,250
You're not respectful of women.

845
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:12,375
You're not really
respectful of people.

846
00:49:12,459 --> 00:49:15,459
- I don't love people?
- Maybe you love them, I don't know.

847
00:49:15,542 --> 00:49:19,375
You take what you want from
them by force or the threat of force.

848
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:21,625
I couldn't live like that.

849
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:24,876
I couldn't bear witness
to violence...

850
00:49:24,959 --> 00:49:26,459
Fuck you!

851
00:49:30,084 --> 00:49:31,876
You're a fucking cunt!

852
00:49:51,084 --> 00:49:52,084
Oh.

853
00:49:57,834 --> 00:49:59,333
How come Benny's not outside?

854
00:49:59,417 --> 00:50:01,042
He just got here,
he's going out.

855
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,042
Where is he?

856
00:50:05,126 --> 00:50:08,126
He's in your office on the
phone with his girlfriend.

857
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:16,168
Hey, Ton', how's it going?

858
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,876
You can take the night off.
I'll spell you.

859
00:50:18,959 --> 00:50:21,079
No, no, no, Ton', that's
all right, it's okay, really.

860
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:23,168
I'll take over, okay,
for tonight.

861
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:25,917
Okay, well... 'night, Mrs. S.

862
00:50:26,001 --> 00:50:27,709
Good night, Benny, thank you.

863
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:37,250
- You want coffee?
- No.
