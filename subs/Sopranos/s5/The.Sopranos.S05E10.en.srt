Fuck this. I'm calling Carlo.

32
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:11,792
Yeah, they didn't show.

33
00:02:11,876 --> 00:02:14,084
The Vespa scooters.

34
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:18,209
We gotta wait.

35
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,917
Carlo was furious.

36
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:22,521
His guys waited by
the Hackensack River

37
00:02:22,584 --> 00:02:24,084
all fucking night.

38
00:02:24,168 --> 00:02:25,667
Fucking Vespas
never got in my hands.

39
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:28,959
This is Port Newark.

40
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:30,522
Where the fuck
were your longshoremen?

41
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:33,209
Heightened security at ports,
al Qaeda.

42
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:35,417
Done, Johnny.

43
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,042
I gotta go.

44
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,917
Nice job, Billy boy.

45
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:47,892
Carlo was told it was a go.

46
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:49,995
If it didn't happen,
how come nobody called?

47
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:53,042
A lot of things didn't happen
that seem like they happen.

48
00:02:53,126 --> 00:02:54,750
Your cousin didn't whack Joey.

49
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:56,876
The Vespas never got
into my hands.

50
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:04,292
- Come on! Go, Soph!
- On the ball, Keaton!

51
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,250
Hustle! Hey, Soph is open!

52
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,168
She's open! Come on!

53
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,792
She's gotta be at least 11.

54
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:12,875
Don't put up with that, Lissie!

55
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,442
Careful with those elbows,
number seven!

56
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:18,168
Hey, out of bounds!
Out of bounds!

57
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,709
Go, Lissie, go!

58
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,417
They're just a bunch of losers!

59
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,292
Hey, no negatives, you!

60
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,209
Come on, putz, charge the ball!

61
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:27,834
Charge it!

62
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,709
Foul!

63
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:32,084
That kid tripped my kid!

64
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:34,168
That's legal.
She was going for the ball.

65
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,917
- She was not.
- Score!

66
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:37,542
Score! Come on!

67
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,001
Your kid is out of control.

68
00:03:39,084 --> 00:03:41,084
She's been tripping
and pushing all summer.

69
00:03:41,168 --> 00:03:43,333
Oh, shut up and get out of here.

70
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:45,042
Don't tell me to shut up!

71
00:03:48,168 --> 00:03:49,917
What, are you crazy?

72
00:03:51,084 --> 00:03:52,333
Oh!

73
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:56,333
Please. Come on!

74
00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:59,042
- Somebody!
- How do you like it now, bitch?

75
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:02,500
Her kid kicked my kid. Get off!

76
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,001
- Cost you 100.
- Call.

77
00:04:07,084 --> 00:04:09,126
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

78
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:15,333
I talked to John.

79
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:17,126
The Vespa scooters came in,

80
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,584
but there was no opportunity
to grab them

81
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:22,259
because of increased security
at the ports.

82
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:23,834
Jesus Christ!

83
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:26,168
The young crowd is crazy
for these scooters.

84
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,168
He owes me half
that fucking load.

85
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,370
- You're not buying it?
- I don't know what to think.

86
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:32,459
He's getting awfully
fucking cute with his remarks.

87
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:35,042
All I know is his behavior
at that kid's funeral

88
00:04:35,126 --> 00:04:36,375
was a disgrace.

89
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:38,179
It's a big part
of my livelihood, that port.

90
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,417
I will say,

91
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,750
very interesting timing, T.

92
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:43,333
You and John had that
chat at the funeral,

93
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,333
whatever that was.

94
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:46,876
Suddenly, no Vespas.

95
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:52,750
All right, I gotta take this.

96
00:04:54,584 --> 00:04:55,667
Whoa, whoa.

97
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,126
Take one of Carlo's guys,

98
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:59,168
start hanging around
down Port Newark.

99
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,126
Find out what the fuck
is going on.

100
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,001
The property taxes, I know.

101
00:05:05,084 --> 00:05:06,417
Hello to you too.

102
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,834
I thought you should know,

103
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:09,792
your sister Janice got arrested.

104
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,459
- What?
<i>- In Essex County this afternoon,</i>

105
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:14,917
<i>an incident of sports rage
among soccer moms</i>

106
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:16,667
<i>led to the arrest
of a Verona woman</i>

107
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,459
<i>with ties to the Mafia.</i>

108
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:20,250
<i>Our Gillian Glessner
was on the scene.</i>

109
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,459
<i>What about it, Gillian?</i>

110
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:22,959
<i>Think that other mother
better go</i>

111
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:24,584
<i>into the soccer mom
protection program?</i>

112
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,292
<i>Maybe she should, Carl.</i>

113
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,126
<i>It started here
at Summit Avenue Park</i>

114
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:29,876
<i>during a 9 
and 10 year old girls'</i>

115
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,168
<i>club soccer match,</i>

116
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,959
<i>an altercation
between soccer moms</i>

117
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:36,001
<i>that sent one mother to the
hospital, and one to jail.</i>

118
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:38,709
<i>Denise McCarthy, a parent,
witnessed the violence.</i>

119
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:40,459
<i>I just feel so bad for the kids.</i>

120
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:43,168
<i>Parents taping the match
captured the mêlée.</i>

121
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,792
<i>Somebody!</i>

122
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:47,750
<i>How do you like it now, bitch?</i>

123
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,459
<i>Her kid kicked my kid!</i>

124
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:53,126
<i>Charges are still pending,</i>

125
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:55,126
<i>but we know that
the woman shown here</i>

126
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:57,667
<i>being taken into custody
is Janice Baccalieri,</i>

127
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,417
<i>sister of reputed New Jersey
mob boss Anthony Soprano.</i>

128
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,042
<i>Guess you could call it
a Mafia-related hit.</i>

129
00:06:04,126 --> 00:06:06,834
<i>Ha ha. We spoke with
psychologist Bela Kakuk.</i>

130
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:09,333
<i>It's a growing problem
in our society.</i>

131
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:12,126
<i>Psychologists are finding
that certain individuals</i>

132
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:14,542
<i>are particularly prone to rage.</i>

133
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:18,834
<i>Almost any frustration,
inconvenience</i>

134
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:22,584
<i>or perceived inconsideration
will set them off.</i>

135
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:24,333
Motherfucker!

136
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:30,834
Janice, open the door!

137
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:34,709
- Where is she?
- It wasn't my fault!

138
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:37,167
My name was all over the
fucking TV because of your bullshit!

139
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:39,250
It's not that simple, Tony.

140
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,792
Apparently the woman's kid
was picking on Sophia.

141
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:43,168
Why didn't they
collar her, then?

142
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,041
I am suing the township
for wrongful arrest...

143
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:46,959
- No, you're not!
- ...and the YSO.

144
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:48,542
No. No, you're not!

145
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,709
What you're gonna do
is you're gonna call Neil Mink,

146
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:52,876
you're gonna play it down,
you're gonna pay the fine

147
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,542
and not turn this into
one of your causes célèbres.

148
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,500
Anybody's side but mine.

149
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,500
That bitch is lucky
I didn't kill her.

150
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:01,168
Well, we know that.

151
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:03,792
What?

152
00:07:05,084 --> 00:07:06,625
You and your fucking temper,
Janice.

153
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:07,959
Get out!

154
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,959
This is the end of it.

155
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,542
Get out!

156
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,792
Tony.

157
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:28,459
I know this looks bad.

158
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:33,001
But on the other hand,
she called Sophia her daughter.

159
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:35,459
I don't give a fuck.

160
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,584
All right, I do give a fuck.

161
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,067
But how many times
I gotta tell you?

162
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,917
Get control of your wife!

163
00:07:45,284 --> 00:07:47,409
<i>Sophia.</i>

164
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:51,333
<i>Phia?</i>

165
00:07:58,168 --> 00:08:00,084
I'm so embarrassed.

166
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:02,292
I don't wanna see
any of my friends again.

167
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,959
Well, when you're a parent,
you'll see.

168
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:07,876
You'll defend your children
like a lion with her cubs.

169
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:11,209
- You're not my parent.
- What did you say?

170
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:14,542
I'm here.

171
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:17,250
And I try to care very much.

172
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:19,792
Now get to sleep.

173
00:08:19,876 --> 00:08:21,333
You gonna punch me?

174
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:25,209
Jan, can I talk to you?

175
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:31,750
Sophia, go to sleep.

176
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,209
We'll talk tomorrow.
I'm exhausted.

177
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:44,959
No. Now.

178
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:47,126
What, I don't have
a say in things?

179
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:50,050
Janice, I think you need
professional help.

180
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,168
I'll be having an extra session
with Sandy, believe me.

181
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,876
Sandy, Sandy. What does she do?

182
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,749
She tells you you were
picked on by your father

183
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,542
and asks you to read
her screenplays.

184
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,084
I think there's
anger specialists.

185
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:03,292
And I think you should see
a weight-loss specialist.

186
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,168
You don't see it in yourself.

187
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,001
I heard you with Sophia.

188
00:09:07,084 --> 00:09:09,126
Youse were getting along
so much better.

189
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:12,126
She says one little thing,
and you get nasty.

190
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:14,417
I'm so sore.

191
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,542
This is not
an isolated incident.

192
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,917
They won't let you shop
up at the corner anymore.

193
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:21,250
Those coffee beans
were burnt, Bobby.

194
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,625
You tasted them.

195
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:27,042
Janice, I like a spitfire type,
I told you.

196
00:09:27,126 --> 00:09:28,959
But we can't live like this,
me and the kids.

197
00:09:29,042 --> 00:09:30,292
Like what?

198
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:33,250
This was a nice house.

199
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,042
Peaceful. I don't know.

200
00:09:35,126 --> 00:09:37,792
There wasn't all this
yelling and tension.

201
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:39,709
How could you understand?

202
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:43,917
Your dad was a sweetheart,
even when he had emphysema.

203
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:47,584
My house, it was dog-eat-dog.

204
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,834
Well, be that as it may,
the past and all,

205
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:51,417
if you don't go
to these anger classes

206
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,750
they have or whatever,

207
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:55,168
this with us
ain't gonna work out.

208
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,834
Look out, ladies and gentlemen.

209
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:09,168
He's rolling. It's nine.

210
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,542
Place nine.

211
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:17,292
What do you think
he clears here?

212
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,084
Two crap tables,
blackjack, roulette.

213
00:10:22,168 --> 00:10:23,834
You gotta figure
he's grabbing anywhere

214
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:27,292
from 2,500 to five G's
a night for himself.

215
00:10:30,084 --> 00:10:31,750
It used to be you, didn't it?

216
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:33,001
Teacher's pet?

217
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:35,209
Stop making meatballs, Paulie.

218
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:37,168
I'm just saying.

219
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,375
Now you know
what I went through.

220
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:46,917
It's the same Gina
had at her wedding.

221
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:48,561
We should see how it looks
on your face.

222
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:50,459
Chrissy.

223
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,667
The fuck?

224
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,126
- What's up?
- Hey there, cuz.

225
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:13,459
- Guess who called me this morning.
- How'd you find me?

226
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,917
- Oh, you're not gonna guess?
- Okay, who?

227
00:11:16,001 --> 00:11:17,542
Our friend with the orchard.

228
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,709
No shit. He okay?

229
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:22,417
Yeah. Sold the place.
Moving to Florida.

230
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,709
He should.
He's getting on in years.

231
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,876
Oh, shit.

232
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,042
You still got your canned
peaches up there.

233
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,001
I just had the car serviced.

234
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:33,917
Watch what you say.

235
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:35,917
I gotta move that shit? Again?

236
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:37,667
That developer's going up there.

237
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,375
Now, obviously it wouldn't
be good for you or our friend

238
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:42,375
if somebody opened
the canned fruit.

239
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:43,959
So you and your cousin here,

240
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:45,750
you're gonna go there
and take care of it.

241
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:46,917
I'll do it.

242
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:48,500
I'm worried about the old guy.

243
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:50,167
- I told you, I'll do it.
- The thing is,

244
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,375
my old man's got a few jars
up there also.

245
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:54,168
Could make problems
for my uncle.

246
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,042
It's gonna be a lot of work,

247
00:11:58,126 --> 00:12:00,750
which with Louise around,
can only be done at night.

248
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:02,001
That's true.

249
00:12:02,084 --> 00:12:03,332
This thing's gotta
be done in two weeks,

250
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,417
the latest.

251
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,126
Bulldozers are coming.

252
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:08,584
So, what, are you
picking out wedding cakes?

253
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:09,743
Yeah.

254
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:11,418
Hope you have better luck than I did.

255
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,834
Why? You didn't like your cake?

256
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:15,437
I think your luck's
been fucking great,

257
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:17,042
and listen to you
cursing it out.

258
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:20,292
What, you got something
you wanna say?

259
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,709
- All right.
- So call me.

260
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:36,417
Who is this Uncle Pat anyway?

261
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,959
He was a knock-around guy
like Tony's dad,

262
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:43,417
but they let him retire
to this farm upstate New York.

263
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:46,959
It sounds funny, but it wasn't.

264
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:49,084
He had the hiccups
for, like, a year.

265
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,209
Jeez.

266
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:51,959
Great guy. He had a daughter,

267
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:53,500
but she lived with her mom.

268
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:58,750
Us boys each got sent up there
summers when we hit up 12 or 13.

269
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:00,209
He'd school us.

270
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:02,709
Did he have the hiccups?

271
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:05,250
No, I told you, that went away.

272
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,084
What, you think
it's fucking funny?

273
00:13:07,168 --> 00:13:09,292
He almost committed suicide
because of it.

274
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,292
How would you like it?

275
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,375
Where's my Barney's underpants
with the ventilated cotton?

276
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,168
Still in the dryer.

277
00:13:20,584 --> 00:13:22,168
Tell you one thing,

278
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,500
I need fucking Tony B. up there
like I need a third nut.

279
00:13:25,584 --> 00:13:27,750
All this resentment.

280
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:29,168
He is your cousin.

281
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,542
Yeah? Should've seen him
when I was little.

282
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,250
Him and Tony both.

283
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:37,500
How they broke my balls,
teased me.

284
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:41,750
One time, I was spending the
summer up at Uncle Pat's farm,

285
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:43,126
just like they used to.

286
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:44,375
I was 11.

287
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,792
They came up, they were
like 19, to shoot guns.

288
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:48,584
They didn't take me with them.

289
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,917
And when I tramped through
the stickers and found them,

290
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,459
they said I had to be initiated
into a special club

291
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,792
by being tied to a tree

292
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,542
alone in the orchard
for an hour.

293
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:02,459
I was on that tree till
3:00 in the fucking morning.

294
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:03,876
Aw.

295
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,542
I worshipped these two guys.

296
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,209
Tony Soprano especially.

297
00:14:07,292 --> 00:14:09,209
When he was by himself,

298
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:11,001
he used to push me
on my Big Wheels,

299
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,333
he'd teach me curse words.

300
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,375
When he was by himself.

301
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:19,876
Where's the Tinactin?

302
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,417
Right on the night table.

303
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:26,333
And here we are again.

304
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:27,834
Tony B. goes wrong,

305
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:31,042
and Tony lays a 200K-a-year
cash cow on him.

306
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,876
Christopher,
don't get mad, okay?

307
00:14:41,168 --> 00:14:43,250
I know we kind of touched on it
a couple times,

308
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,876
but you're so unhappy.

309
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:48,667
What if we left here,

310
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,250
went far away,

311
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,250
and you went
into something else?

312
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,417
- Like what?
- I don't know, like...

313
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,333
Pick up your writing, maybe?

314
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:01,126
Male modeling.

315
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:04,750
I'll get back
to the writing someday.

316
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:07,084
But from a position
of great wealth.

317
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,959
As far as male modeling,
I'd probably be a success,

318
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:14,084
but I wouldn't want to be
around those fucking people.

319
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,542
I'm a soldier, Adriana.

320
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:21,001
When are you gonna
understand that?

321
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:33,500
What the fuck?

322
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:35,667
- Carmela.
- What?

323
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,667
There's no water in the pool.

324
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,126
Yeah, I had it drained.

325
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:41,709
The electricity costs a fortune.

326
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:44,250
I can't afford that.
You're the only one who uses it.

327
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,084
I thought we were getting
along better lately.

328
00:15:54,168 --> 00:15:57,417
So you polluted all the decent
lawyers in New Jersey

329
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,917
so they can't represent me?

330
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,250
You couldn't even play fair.

331
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,917
I'm not the one that wanted it!

332
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:03,625
Okay, so let's
just pretend that you

333
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:06,375
weren't begging for it in a
million different ways, okay,

334
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:08,417
because I am worn out here.

335
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,042
Motherfucker.

336
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:46,168
He's a nice kid, Finn.

337
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,750
Right?

338
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:49,333
Right.

339
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,001
We gonna throw them
an engagement party or what?

340
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:59,042
Well, if we can be civil.

341
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:02,042
She's so young.

342
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:04,417
Same age we were.

343
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:10,333
It wasn't all bad.

344
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:23,584
Last time, I asked you to
jot down one or two situations

345
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,834
or people that trigger
your anger,

346
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:27,542
so much so that when
you think about it,

347
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,209
you get angry all over again.

348
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:30,500
Anybody got...?

349
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:33,209
Let's give Bradley
a chance this time.

350
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:36,209
My partner parked me in again.

351
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:38,168
I couldn't find the keys.

352
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,709
I had to wake him up,
and he starts yelling at me.

353
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:42,084
Describe the feelings.

354
00:17:42,168 --> 00:17:43,459
I think--

355
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:45,209
My stepkids do that
all the time.

356
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:47,500
They leave their bikes
in the middle of the garage,

357
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:49,375
and if I wanna pull in,
I gotta get out

358
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:51,876
and move the bikes
with a car full of groceries.

359
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:54,584
Doris, can't you keep Billy's
bike out of the driveway?

360
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:00,542
It was a famous commercial
from the '60s.

361
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,917
Bufferin.

362
00:18:02,001 --> 00:18:04,834
Guy has a headache,
and he takes it out on his wife.

363
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:08,709
Back to Bradley.

364
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:11,625
I'm trying to get into his
physical sensations of anger.

365
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:13,792
He saw red. Who wouldn't?

366
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:15,750
She's right.
I mean, why is he in here?

367
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:18,625
Why isn't his roommate in
therapy for selfishness issues?

368
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:21,625
There are always things
out there that are irritating

369
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:23,459
and annoying
and out of our control.

370
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:26,568
What we can control
is our response to those triggers.

371
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,168
So people just get a free pass.
The whole world?

372
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,792
I told you about my supervisor,

373
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,959
checking my work
and nobody else's?

374
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:34,250
I wonder why.

375
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,500
Because you're a minority.

376
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:37,333
Exactly. That's why I'm in here.

377
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:38,917
Uh-huh.

378
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:41,250
You seem angry
about Evelyn's problem.

379
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,417
It makes me mad.

380
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,084
"It" doesn't make you mad.

381
00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:46,292
"You" make you mad.

382
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,250
I come from a biased family,
but I was different.

383
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:52,375
I put all my faith and my hopes
into the civil rights movement.

384
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:54,917
I left home and I marched.

385
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,209
And for what?

386
00:18:56,292 --> 00:18:58,459
So they could ride around
in their SUVs

387
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,084
blasting that rap shit,

388
00:19:00,168 --> 00:19:02,459
and you can't say anything
because they might have guns?

389
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,876
Wait a fucking minute.
Who's "they"?

390
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:07,209
If the shoe fits.

391
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:08,417
This is fucking priceless.

392
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,917
Okay, let's not
time-travel here.

393
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:11,917
Let's try to stay
in the present.

394
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:13,792
Janice, you're angry.

395
00:19:13,876 --> 00:19:15,209
Let's stay with that.

396
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:17,584
What are your actual
physical feelings right now?

397
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:19,375
I'd like to punch you
in the face.

398
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:21,625
Your hands are clenched.

399
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:23,250
Did you realize that?

400
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:26,042
You're provoking me
to make a point.

401
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:28,459
And maybe that's your job,
but I don't like it.

402
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,042
Look at you.
You're not even listening.

403
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:32,917
- Hello? He's talking to me.
- No.

404
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:35,750
You and me, we do most
of the talking in here.

405
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:39,084
The man is trying to say
that those people outside,

406
00:19:39,168 --> 00:19:40,625
they do the thing.

407
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:43,209
But we're the ones that get
all upset and start carrying on.

408
00:19:43,292 --> 00:19:44,959
That's all he's saying.

409
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,834
The Hudson Valley.

410
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:58,333
That Legend of Sleepy Hollow
cartoon

411
00:19:58,417 --> 00:20:00,168
scared the piss out of me
when I was a kid.

412
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,001
Would you mind
watching your shoe?

413
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:04,917
Oh, sure.

414
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:07,959
It's a $50,000 vehicle.
I don't want it scuffed up.

415
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,500
Uncle Pat's farm?

416
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:21,917
When you're 12, 13, man,

417
00:20:22,001 --> 00:20:24,417
it's like fucking heaven, right?

418
00:20:26,001 --> 00:20:29,500
Running around in the woods,
driving that tractor.

419
00:20:30,792 --> 00:20:32,667
He made me clear
the brush by the fence

420
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,209
with a fucking scythe, though.

421
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:36,375
Yeah. I had to do that.

422
00:20:36,459 --> 00:20:37,542
Tony too.

423
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,709
And water his fucking tomatoes

424
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:41,959
and his <i>basinigol</i>.

425
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:44,292
Changed, though,
you know, Pat's,

426
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,209
after Louise came
back there to live.

427
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:49,209
It wasn't just you and Pat
and his great stories.

428
00:20:57,209 --> 00:20:59,168
They used to call me
Ichabod Crane.

429
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,126
Who?

430
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:03,417
Some very sorry people,
that's who.

431
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:09,333
The Carmela front?

432
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:12,667
Did you two ever discuss
that evening you made love?

433
00:21:15,126 --> 00:21:16,709
It was a one-time deal.

434
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:19,084
I've moved on.

435
00:21:19,168 --> 00:21:20,834
What about the depression?

436
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,168
Your revelation
about your cousin?

437
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,417
His prison sentence?

438
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,333
You were very upset.

439
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:34,625
Tell you the truth, I haven't had
a lot of time to think about that.

440
00:21:37,209 --> 00:21:38,750
My sister...

441
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,834
She attacked some woman

442
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:45,250
at her stepkid's soccer game.

443
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,001
You've mentioned
her temper before.

444
00:21:48,084 --> 00:21:52,126
She got charged with aggravated
assault and resisting arrest.

445
00:21:52,209 --> 00:21:53,750
Excellent.

446
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:56,001
- Let's talk about that.
- What?

447
00:21:56,084 --> 00:21:58,917
- Rage.
- Why?

448
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:00,876
Depression is rage
turned inward.

449
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:05,709
Tell me about
the Soprano temper.

450
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,959
Well, the thing is,
it's bad for business.

451
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:09,625
Clouds your judgment.

452
00:22:09,709 --> 00:22:12,001
John, he always had
a terrible temper.

453
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:13,500
- John?
- Gotti.

454
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:15,375
And in the end,
I think it hurt him.

455
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,001
See, we forget
that in the old days,

456
00:22:17,084 --> 00:22:20,959
the ones that came over,
that started this thing,

457
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:22,584
they didn't get mad.

458
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:26,126
They just smiled and nodded
and made sure you got it later.

459
00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:28,375
That's the whole
beautiful point.

460
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:30,001
You know what they say.

461
00:22:30,084 --> 00:22:32,375
Revenge is like
serving cold cuts.

462
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:37,375
I think it's, "Revenge is a dish
best served cold."

463
00:22:37,459 --> 00:22:40,292
- So, what'd I say?
- But why revenge all the time?

464
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:43,500
Where does it come from,
this insatiable anger

465
00:22:43,584 --> 00:22:45,500
you and your sister share?

466
00:22:45,584 --> 00:22:48,042
I was wondering how long it was
gonna take for her to come up.

467
00:22:48,126 --> 00:22:51,001
Your mother?
What about your father?

468
00:22:51,084 --> 00:22:54,001
You never saw her
chop off someone's finger.

469
00:22:54,084 --> 00:22:56,250
Told you about that, didn't I?

470
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,042
Yes.

471
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:02,209
- Oh, Jesus, I wish I hadn't.
- Why?

472
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:04,584
I mean, I dress up nice
and everything when I come here.

473
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:07,001
Okay, let's stick
to the subject.

474
00:23:07,084 --> 00:23:10,750
- Which is what?
- Your own intolerance for frustration.

475
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,168
"Thank you for holding.
Your call is important to us."

476
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,834
If it's so important to you,
answer the fucking phone!

477
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:23,959
- Stay with that.
- It's just a level of bullshit!

478
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:25,834
Bullshit! Bullshit!

479
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:27,625
Every fucking new idea
they come up with

480
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:30,209
that's supposed to make things
better makes things worse.

481
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:32,126
Okay, right, I agree.

482
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:33,834
"The center cannot hold.

483
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:36,292
The falcon cannot
hear the falconer."

484
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,250
What the fuck
are you talking about?

485
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,459
We live in a time
of technological

486
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:42,500
and spiritual crisis.

487
00:23:42,584 --> 00:23:44,625
But you feel you're above
all of it.

488
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:48,667
Certainly above any
inconvenience or annoyance.

489
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,542
And if things don't go your way,

490
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:54,209
instead of being
merely disappointed

491
00:23:54,292 --> 00:23:57,500
or inconvenienced, you blow.

492
00:24:03,917 --> 00:24:06,042
My sister's...

493
00:24:06,126 --> 00:24:08,834
She's taking
anger-management classes.

494
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:12,792
You know, maybe she's on
the right track.

495
00:24:12,876 --> 00:24:15,292
Is this something
you'd consider?

496
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,792
No.

497
00:24:17,876 --> 00:24:20,042
Well, but I-I-I'll admit
it's not good for me,

498
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,292
all this fucking agitation.

499
00:24:24,084 --> 00:24:25,917
Wears me out.

500
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:27,917
I'm fucking exhausted
all the time.

501
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:29,333
Where did we start off?

502
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:31,667
I don't know.

503
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,126
Depression is rage
turned inward.

504
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:38,959
Yeah. Yeah.

505
00:24:41,584 --> 00:24:42,834
Oh!

506
00:24:45,876 --> 00:24:47,333
This is nice.

507
00:24:48,876 --> 00:24:51,459
For inner-city kids like me,
this was important.

508
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:54,459
Inner city? You lived next to
the largest shopping mall in New Jersey.

509
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:57,667
It's over now. She's sticking me
in that home in Florida,

510
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,350
and that's the last
I'll ever see of her.

511
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:01,709
I'll be right down
the road, Pop.

512
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,333
I got a beautiful condo.

513
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:06,084
Thinks she's gonna meet
some old, lonely widower.

514
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:15,292
Louise, it's time for dessert.

515
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:17,042
I'm getting it.

516
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:21,042
And do me a favor.

517
00:25:21,126 --> 00:25:24,333
Be as polite as you are
when it's just the two of us.

518
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:33,250
We know where Chrissy
buried the guy.

519
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:36,292
But with Uncle Johnny's,
you gotta help us out.

520
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,917
Well...

521
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:42,792
I'm not exactly sure,

522
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:44,542
but there was two of them.

523
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:45,959
The Johnson brothers.

524
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:47,709
You don't remember where?

525
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,042
It was a long time ago.

526
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:55,876
We can't excavate
the whole fucking place.

527
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:58,250
Because you know
what Tony's gonna say?

528
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:00,625
Let him come up here
and dig then.

529
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:01,917
Please.

530
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:03,917
He's a heart attack
waiting to happen.

531
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:05,500
That's no joke.

532
00:26:05,584 --> 00:26:07,459
Our bodies are 86% water.

533
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:10,375
His last blood test,
he was 65% zeppole.

534
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:17,750
When he first heard
the term "pie in the sky,"

535
00:26:17,834 --> 00:26:19,500
he volunteered
for the 82nd Airborne.

536
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:22,084
That's pretty good.

537
00:26:22,168 --> 00:26:24,542
I learned in recovery

538
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:28,584
that he's just tamping down
his feelings, T, by eating.

539
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:33,126
I should talk to him.
It's a shame, you know?

540
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:35,292
Because he used to be
the funnest guy in the world.

541
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:37,084
When was that?

542
00:26:39,084 --> 00:26:40,750
He's got the world by the balls,

543
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:43,333
and he acts like everything's
a big fucking imposition.

544
00:26:43,417 --> 00:26:47,375
Being at the top,
he's isolated himself.

545
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:49,750
Yeah, it's just him
and his money.

546
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,168
Hello.

547
00:27:10,084 --> 00:27:11,500
Who is this guy, anyway?

548
00:27:11,584 --> 00:27:12,750
My first.

549
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:14,959
Czechoslovakian guy.

550
00:27:15,042 --> 00:27:16,709
This is the second time
I'm moving him.

551
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:30,126
Ah!

552
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:35,292
Come here, you little fuck.

553
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:36,750
Guys, wait.

554
00:27:36,834 --> 00:27:38,042
Come here, you little fuck.

555
00:27:38,126 --> 00:27:39,459
It wasn't me...

556
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:44,625
Help! Please, don't kill me.

557
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:46,917
What the fuck
are you running for?

558
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:49,917
The night of the 12th,
there was a ship from Italy

559
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,209
with these containers
of Vespa motor scooters.

560
00:27:52,292 --> 00:27:54,792
I don't know anything
about any fucking Vespas!

561
00:27:54,876 --> 00:27:57,500
We know they got here.
What happened to them?

562
00:27:57,584 --> 00:27:59,500
I don't know. I wasn't here!

563
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:02,709
Well, apparently he says
he wasn't here.

564
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,709
Who picked up our motherfucking,

565
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:10,959
cocksucking Vespas?

566
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:18,250
In two seconds,
this is going up your ass.

567
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,500
It was the guys from New York.

568
00:28:20,584 --> 00:28:22,126
Phil Leotardo and them.

569
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,500
Listen...

570
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:40,168
Thanks for doing this.

571
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,584
You didn't have to.

572
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:43,834
Fuck that.
You're my little cousin.

573
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:57,459
I think I can imagine what you
may be hearing about me,

574
00:28:57,542 --> 00:28:59,042
and what happened in New York.

575
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,042
All I can say is,
there's no truth to it.

576
00:29:02,126 --> 00:29:04,084
I didn't think nothing.

577
00:29:04,168 --> 00:29:06,084
As far as Tony putting me
in at the casino,

578
00:29:06,168 --> 00:29:07,876
I knew people
were gonna resent that.

579
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:11,876
But I went away for a long time,
stood up for this family.

580
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:15,084
And you, or anybody,
can think what they like,

581
00:29:15,168 --> 00:29:16,834
but I feel I had
a little coming to me.

582
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:19,709
Hey, absolutely. I was telling
Benny that the other day.

583
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:20,917
He was complaining.

584
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:22,792
And what I said
about Tony before?

585
00:29:22,876 --> 00:29:24,584
You know I love him
like a brother.

586
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:27,042
I love him too.

587
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:10,959
We saw the guy down the pier.

588
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,459
John has the Vespas.

589
00:30:14,168 --> 00:30:16,625
To think of how supportive
you were of him.

590
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:19,084
That whole Little Carmine
fiasco.

591
00:30:19,168 --> 00:30:20,292
It's fucking payback.

592
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:21,917
Johnny's got it in his head that

593
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:24,249
somehow my cousin had
something to do with Joey Peeps.

594
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,584
Johnny should be looking
for the real killers

595
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:29,625
instead of spending all his time
on that golf course.

596
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:35,792
Whole fucking shipment
of cheese coming in next month.

597
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:38,168
The imported provolone.

598
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,375
I guess we can kiss
that goodbye too now, right?

599
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:49,917
Motherfucker!

600
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:08,209
Carmela.

601
00:31:08,292 --> 00:31:10,375
Hi. What are you doing here?

602
00:31:10,459 --> 00:31:11,959
My son is a senior here now,
isn't he?

603
00:31:12,042 --> 00:31:14,417
We were electing party chairs
for Senior Night.

604
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,625
Oh. Right.

605
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:18,417
So how are you?

606
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,459
- Fine.
- Because you were pretty upset

607
00:31:20,542 --> 00:31:22,625
when you left,
and I wanted to call.

608
00:31:22,709 --> 00:31:24,584
I began to really
rue what happened.

609
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:27,250
- I was probably over the top.
- I'm going back with my husband.

610
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:30,292
Oh. That's good.

611
00:31:31,292 --> 00:31:33,250
All the best.

612
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:50,876
You don't drink no more?

613
00:31:52,168 --> 00:31:54,042
Clean and sober, 14 months.

614
00:31:55,126 --> 00:31:57,084
Yeah, your mother
has that problem.

615
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,084
Good for you.

616
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:15,709
That's right.

617
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,584
- What?
- The Johnson brothers' bodies.

618
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:23,542
I know where they are.

619
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:29,250
Over by the fence
in the northwest corner,

620
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:31,750
because that night
I noticed one of my pickers

621
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:34,417
had stuck a Swiss Colony bottle
upside down

622
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,750
on one of the fenceposts.

623
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:37,625
And I was plenty goddamn mad

624
00:32:37,709 --> 00:32:39,625
they were drinking on the job,
I'll tell you.

625
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,792
It's still there,
the glass bottle.

626
00:32:42,876 --> 00:32:45,417
- Are you fucking sure?
- Lunch!

627
00:32:47,084 --> 00:32:48,364
Look what I got for you,
Chrissy.

628
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:49,625
Thank you.

629
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:50,834
Sandwich?

630
00:32:50,917 --> 00:32:52,126
Oh, you're the best.

631
00:32:52,209 --> 00:32:54,750
- Here, Pop.
- Thank you.

632
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,001
Beautiful.

633
00:33:03,584 --> 00:33:05,625
This is mail from
three fucking weeks ago.

634
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:08,333
The girl didn't even
show up today.

635
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:10,374
Why don't you call the service
and get somebody new?

636
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:12,959
Two classes, she's telling
people how to run their life.

637
00:33:13,042 --> 00:33:15,667
Don't let me stop you from
taking your kids to the rink.

638
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:31,584
You have every right to be mad
at me, and I apologize.

639
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:34,459
I know it's bad for the family.

640
00:33:34,542 --> 00:33:36,542
For business.

641
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:38,209
But I'm working on it.

642
00:33:42,126 --> 00:33:44,084
Yeah, I know. Bobby told me.

643
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:49,126
So how's that going?

644
00:33:49,209 --> 00:33:50,876
Anger management?

645
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:52,624
It's the best thing that ever
happened to me.

646
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:56,750
And it's such a relief
to let go of all that shit.

647
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,375
I never realized
what an angry person I was

648
00:33:59,459 --> 00:34:01,667
and how it fed itself.

649
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,625
So they got you
on tranquillizers?

650
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,459
No.

651
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:10,584
Basically, it's taking
responsibility for your anger,

652
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:14,584
and learning to recognize
your feelings of anger,

653
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:16,250
and that they're just feelings.

654
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:18,042
You don't have to act on them.

655
00:34:18,126 --> 00:34:20,446
That's just what people want
so they can walk all over you.

656
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,542
A lot of anger
is self-importance.

657
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:24,750
Self-importance?

658
00:34:24,834 --> 00:34:27,084
Problems with authority.

659
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:30,042
Dr. Seepman locks the door
promptly at 7:00.

660
00:34:30,126 --> 00:34:34,042
People wig out if they don't
get in, start banging on the door.

661
00:34:34,126 --> 00:34:35,709
It's a big lesson.

662
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:39,625
I was making everybody
in my life miserable.

663
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:41,250
Yelling and screaming,

664
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:43,375
or pouting
and feeling victimized.

665
00:34:43,459 --> 00:34:47,750
But I feel so much better now
about everything.

666
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:51,959
It's like this great sadness
is beginning to lift.

667
00:34:52,042 --> 00:34:53,209
Sadness?

668
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:54,542
Yeah.

669
00:34:58,876 --> 00:35:00,292
I'm happy for you.

670
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:02,250
Thank you.

671
00:35:03,292 --> 00:35:04,542
I am.

672
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:32,168
Your bid, Chrissy.

673
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:35,667
You expecting someone?

674
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:39,750
Ho! There he is!

675
00:35:39,834 --> 00:35:43,333
My God, I don't believe it.

676
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:44,876
Who's that? Anthony?

677
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,459
What's the matter?
You all right?

678
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:55,834
God, you're big. Oh!

679
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,209
Look at those shoulders.

680
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:02,084
Jan sends her love.
And Barb too.

681
00:36:02,168 --> 00:36:03,250
Did you eat?

682
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:04,584
Louise, don't ask him.

683
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:07,625
He's a guest.
Just go get him a plate.

684
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:09,126
Sit down.

685
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,500
You look good.

686
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:13,709
Feel good.

687
00:36:15,292 --> 00:36:16,542
So how we doing?

688
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:19,417
Took care of mine last night.

689
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,709
The Johnson brothers
we'll get tonight.

690
00:36:21,792 --> 00:36:25,292
Uncle Pat was like
Johnny Mnemonic.

691
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:26,917
- Right, Uncle Pat?
- Huh?

692
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:29,417
We're playing pinochle.
Take a hand.

693
00:36:37,584 --> 00:36:39,168
This is the life, huh?

694
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,333
I'm with you.

695
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:41,792
Yeah, we were just saying that.

696
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,667
Two... three!

697
00:37:25,584 --> 00:37:27,750
Here's to a job well done.

698
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:31,459
<i><i>Salute</i></i>.

699
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,876
Ah.

700
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:36,792
This place hasn't
changed much, huh?

701
00:37:36,876 --> 00:37:39,459
Met some pretty nice college
girls the other night, huh, Ton'?

702
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:41,750
She liked you. Miss Raven-Hair?

703
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:46,917
Pat seems good, huh?

704
00:37:48,168 --> 00:37:49,667
Louise seems fat.

705
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:58,459
The human body is 86% water.

706
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,667
But Louise's last blood test,
she was 65% zeppole.

707
00:38:06,001 --> 00:38:07,292
That's a good one.

708
00:38:09,001 --> 00:38:11,959
I knew a guy, when he was gonna
eat Philly cheese steak,

709
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:14,542
the mayor of Philly would have
to call out the National Guard.

710
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,834
What the fuck's
so funny about that?

711
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:22,750
Doesn't even make sense.

712
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,500
Well, he's drunk.

713
00:38:26,584 --> 00:38:28,209
Him? No way.

714
00:38:28,292 --> 00:38:29,834
He's in recovery.

715
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:31,876
Oh.

716
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:33,500
Well, if you recover
your fucking balls,

717
00:38:33,584 --> 00:38:34,709
give us a call.

718
00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:36,500
We might like to hang out.

719
00:38:36,584 --> 00:38:38,084
No, seriously, it's not funny.

720
00:38:38,168 --> 00:38:40,876
He's a 12-stepper, right?

721
00:38:40,959 --> 00:38:44,333
Yeah. You know that.
That's right.

722
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:46,959
Maybe he can take another
couple of steps out the fucking door

723
00:38:47,042 --> 00:38:48,375
so we could have some fun?

724
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,333
Come on, don't get pissy now.

725
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:54,876
He's just having a joke,
that's all.

726
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,126
Sobriety's hard enough without
having to get mocked for it.

727
00:38:59,209 --> 00:39:00,459
Oh, Jesus Christ.

728
00:39:00,542 --> 00:39:02,249
Why don't you have
a fucking drink, will you?

729
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,834
'Cause you're driving
everybody crazy with this shit.

730
00:39:04,917 --> 00:39:06,917
The fucking
higher power yammering,

731
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:09,792
and the sweets,
and the Key lime pie and the...

732
00:39:09,876 --> 00:39:11,209
Jesus.

733
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:14,375
Order a fucking bullshot,
will you?

734
00:39:14,459 --> 00:39:15,709
Do me a favor.

735
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:28,667
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
I was being a jerkoff like that.

736
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,042
- No, no, look, it's just...
- No, no, no, no.

737
00:39:31,126 --> 00:39:32,417
You know, come on.

738
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:37,959
Hey, you're doing
the right thing.

739
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,917
You're doing the right thing.

740
00:39:46,542 --> 00:39:48,417
So how do you like his car?

741
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,625
Schwarzenegger's.

742
00:39:49,709 --> 00:39:51,126
Pretty fucking great, huh?

743
00:39:51,209 --> 00:39:53,417
Oh, yeah. The Humvee.
Yeah, yeah, it's nice.

744
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,126
Kind of steep, though.

745
00:39:55,209 --> 00:39:56,833
Come on, you told me
you didn't pay for it.

746
00:39:56,834 --> 00:39:59,250
- You gave the guy a hum-job.
- For the Humvee.

747
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:02,375
Maybe he'd like to hum me.

748
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:04,375
Who, a friend of Bill over here?

749
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:05,834
Fucking wits over here.

750
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:08,042
Bill? I'll say.

751
00:40:08,126 --> 00:40:09,959
That? That's not a bill,
that's a beak.

752
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,126
You know...

753
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:15,417
that was you he made
that joke about,

754
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,417
the zeppole content.

755
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,459
On the way home,

756
00:40:21,542 --> 00:40:22,834
we can drop him off
at Beakskill.

757
00:40:22,917 --> 00:40:24,168
Well, if beaks could kill,

758
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,500
that one certainly would.

759
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:35,292
You know, I could've called you
Ichabod Crane, but I didn't.

760
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:38,126
What the fuck's he talking
about? Ichabod Crane?

761
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:40,667
Nothing.

762
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:48,667
Well, here's
to the Johnson brothers,

763
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,959
whoever the fuck they were.

764
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:54,792
- Johnson brothers.
- Johnson brothers.

765
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:07,142
<i>Back pain? Is your pain...?</i>

766
00:41:07,168 --> 00:41:08,608
<i>...case, and are

767
00:41:10,417 --> 00:41:12,417
<i>Port Newark in New Jersey...</i>

768
00:41:13,834 --> 00:41:15,417
<i>...but one example.</i>

769
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,625
<i>Six million containers</i>

770
00:41:16,709 --> 00:41:18,375
<i>enter U.S. ports every year,</i>

771
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:20,168
<i>yet fewer than 2% of them</i>

772
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,542

773
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:25,168
<i>It is physically impossible</i>

774
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,750
<i>to check every container</i>

775
00:41:26,834 --> 00:41:28,594
<i>without essentially

776
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:30,209
<i>But what keeps officials</i>

777
00:41:30,292 --> 00:41:32,126
<i>from sleeping at night,
they say,</i>

778
00:41:32,209 --> 00:41:34,625
<i>is that terrorists
could use shipping containers</i>

779
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:37,959
<i>to smuggle in a weapon
of mass destruction.</i>

780
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:40,792
<i>It is within the capabilities
of Islamic fundamentalists</i>

781
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:42,168
<i>to track a container</i>

782
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,375
<i>with a Global Positioning System</i>

783
00:41:44,459 --> 00:41:47,084
<i>and detonate a nuclear
or biological weapon</i>

784
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:49,709
<i>- hidden inside.</i>
- Son of a bitch.

785
00:41:49,792 --> 00:41:52,375
<i>In fact, a terrorist could
even use a shipping container</i>

786
00:41:52,459 --> 00:41:55,792
<i>to smuggle himself
into the country.</i>

787
00:41:57,584 --> 00:41:59,001
There he is.

788
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:03,375
What I saw on TV last night.

789
00:42:03,459 --> 00:42:05,792
The ports are wide open.

790
00:42:05,876 --> 00:42:07,500
Government's not doing shit.

791
00:42:07,584 --> 00:42:09,876
Louise, where's
my butter substitute?

792
00:42:09,959 --> 00:42:11,084
Right in front of you.

793
00:42:11,168 --> 00:42:12,375
Didn't you hear what I said?

794
00:42:12,459 --> 00:42:14,139
I knew it was bad,
but you realize there's,

795
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:15,792
like, seven million containers.

796
00:42:15,876 --> 00:42:18,126
The news team put radioactive
shit in one of them.

797
00:42:18,209 --> 00:42:21,042
- It wasn't even detected.
- Please, my ears.

798
00:42:21,126 --> 00:42:23,042
Sit down. Sit.

799
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:24,417
Come on.

800
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,001
I made eggs.

801
00:42:27,834 --> 00:42:29,792
Could've been a goddamn A-bomb.

802
00:42:29,876 --> 00:42:32,500
- You want coffee?
- Yeah.

803
00:42:34,459 --> 00:42:36,709
Fucking terrible nightmares.

804
00:42:36,792 --> 00:42:39,876
Yeah, it knocked the edge right
the hell off your appetite.

805
00:42:42,542 --> 00:42:43,876
What's the matter with you?

806
00:42:43,959 --> 00:42:45,750
No, it is some scary shit.

807
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:48,001
Not my problem much longer.

808
00:42:49,126 --> 00:42:51,084
Speaking of scary shit,
was that you

809
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,459
- in the bathroom this morning?
- Oh, yeah.

810
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:56,209
I thought they already
dropped a biological weapon.

811
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:02,667
All right, I gotta go.

812
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,374
What you talkin' about? I thought
we were gonna go do a little hunting.

813
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:09,168
- You hear the turkeys this morning?
- No, I gotta take off.

814
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,459
Uncle Pat.

815
00:43:10,542 --> 00:43:12,084
Take care of yourself.

816
00:43:12,168 --> 00:43:13,959
Be careful of
the alligators down there.

817
00:43:14,042 --> 00:43:16,542
All right, tough guy.

818
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,709
<i>♪ Don't tell me to stop ♪</i>

819
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:41,876

Hey, Ton'!

823
00:43:54,042 --> 00:43:56,209
What'd you do,
knock over a roadside stand?

824
00:43:56,292 --> 00:43:57,750
My uncle's farm.

825
00:43:57,834 --> 00:44:00,209
Less than a hundred miles
from here.

826
00:44:00,292 --> 00:44:02,375
It's like a whole
different world.

827
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,792
The bullshit really
falls away up there.

828
00:44:17,834 --> 00:44:19,332
Hear about that shit with
the ports now?

829
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:20,959
I know customs agents
are bad for us,

830
00:44:21,042 --> 00:44:23,834
but antiterrorism-wise,
they're doing nothing.

831
00:44:23,917 --> 00:44:26,209
What's it gonna take,
a fucking nuclear bomb?

832
00:44:26,292 --> 00:44:28,000
They caught one of these
al Qaeda cocksuckers

833
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:30,292
in one of these containers,
trying to sneak in there.

834
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:31,834
Thank God they caught him.

835
00:44:31,917 --> 00:44:33,209
There's enough they don't catch.

836
00:44:33,292 --> 00:44:34,417
You gotta realize,

837
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,958
the administration's
busy, though, too,

838
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:38,042
handing out noncompetitive
building contracts

839
00:44:38,126 --> 00:44:39,042
to their friends.

840
00:44:39,126 --> 00:44:42,292
Hell, we can all
understand that.

841
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:44,625
- Mm-hm.
- We're fuckin' sitting ducks here.

842
00:44:44,709 --> 00:44:47,667
The only thing between
our homes and Port Newark

843
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:48,959
is a chain-link fence.

844
00:44:49,042 --> 00:44:50,625
They get a nuclear bomb
in a container,

845
00:44:50,709 --> 00:44:51,876
we're fucking dead.

846
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:54,625
That's why you gotta
live for today.

847
00:44:56,584 --> 00:44:58,333
- What'd you say?
- I said,

848
00:44:58,417 --> 00:45:00,375
that's why you gotta
live for today.

849
00:45:00,459 --> 00:45:03,001
Talking about annihilation,
you stupid fuck.

850
00:45:03,084 --> 00:45:06,001
Your kids, my kids,
burning into cinders.

851
00:45:06,084 --> 00:45:08,209
I can't even think about it.

852
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:10,834
You stupid...

853
00:45:13,459 --> 00:45:15,250
You can't even fucking
think about it?

854
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:20,126
Think about it now?

855
00:45:20,209 --> 00:45:22,209
How about now?

856
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:25,084
Take it easy. Take a walk.

857
00:45:25,168 --> 00:45:26,834
Get some air.

858
00:45:26,917 --> 00:45:28,834
Take a walk.
Take a walk outside.

859
00:45:28,917 --> 00:45:30,959
- Take it easy.
- Sorry, everybody.

860
00:45:34,209 --> 00:45:36,292
Come on. Take it easy.

861
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:53,292
- I wake you up?
- Yeah.

862
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:54,834
I just come from the hospital.

863
00:45:54,917 --> 00:45:56,292
They said you wanted to know.

864
00:45:57,709 --> 00:45:59,667
Oh, how's he doing?

865
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:02,917
Hey.

866
00:46:04,709 --> 00:46:06,917
Sorry. It's all right.

867
00:46:07,001 --> 00:46:09,750
Doctor has a peel at 1:00.

868
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:12,333
- Hi.
- How you doing, hon?

869
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:15,459
- Call me?
- Yeah.

870
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:18,625
Bye.

871
00:46:19,709 --> 00:46:21,333
See you later.

872
00:46:21,417 --> 00:46:22,625
That the dermatology nurse?

873
00:46:22,709 --> 00:46:24,250
- Yeah.
- Nice-looking.

874
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:26,917
Well, they get all the best
skin treatments half-price.

875
00:46:32,001 --> 00:46:34,209
So, what'd they say?

876
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:35,709
He's gonna be okay, the kid?

877
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:38,001
He's big, strapping.
He'll be all right.

878
00:46:38,084 --> 00:46:39,917
But he's got some
hearing loss, one ear.

879
00:46:40,001 --> 00:46:42,292
Looks like
it could be permanent.

880
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:45,209
Skip, the poor fuck knows
he should keep his mouth shut.

881
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,792
Go over there.

882
00:46:51,876 --> 00:46:54,209
You make sure he gets the best.

883
00:47:02,084 --> 00:47:04,459
Thing is, Ton',
he's quitting the Bing.

884
00:47:04,542 --> 00:47:06,042
And he told Sil, he goes,

885
00:47:06,126 --> 00:47:08,459
"And I'd appreciate
if Tony don't come visit me."

886
00:47:08,542 --> 00:47:09,876
He don't wanna see you.

887
00:47:12,459 --> 00:47:14,001
I told him watch his mouth.

888
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,792
These things happen, T.

889
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:18,959
That's why I don't like
to talk politics.

890
00:47:30,292 --> 00:47:31,709
You did?

891
00:47:31,792 --> 00:47:33,750
Please, I couldn't
believe it myself.

892
00:47:33,834 --> 00:47:36,042
Well, are you going
back with Tony?

893
00:47:36,126 --> 00:47:37,168
No.

894
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,375
Then why'd you say it?

895
00:47:38,459 --> 00:47:39,709
I don't know. It just came out.

896
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:42,500
Asshole. He was gonna
call me. Did he?

897
00:47:42,584 --> 00:47:44,168
Jerk.

898
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:46,876
Come in!

899
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:52,001
Hey.

900
00:47:52,084 --> 00:47:53,250
Uncle Pat.

901
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:54,459
Oh.

902
00:47:54,542 --> 00:47:55,709
Where's A.J.?

903
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:57,126
He's not coming.

904
00:47:57,209 --> 00:47:59,089
You lose them to their friends
for a little bit,

905
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:00,375
but he'll be back.

906
00:48:00,459 --> 00:48:01,876
Hi, Uncle Ton'!
- Hey.

907
00:48:06,209 --> 00:48:07,500
Soph?

908
00:48:12,834 --> 00:48:15,001
- Before dinner?
- Half?

909
00:48:18,084 --> 00:48:19,250
Thank you.

910
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:20,625
Mahatma Gandhi over here.

911
00:48:20,709 --> 00:48:22,542
Nice.

912
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:25,001
Hey, Tony.

913
00:48:25,084 --> 00:48:26,564
- Hey.
- I thought I heard your voice.

914
00:48:26,584 --> 00:48:28,168
- Hello?
- Good game on later.

915
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:31,042
I think we're
on the do-not-call list.

916
00:48:31,126 --> 00:48:32,834
Oh, no, we're happy
with our service.

917
00:48:32,917 --> 00:48:36,042
Are those telemarketers?
Just hang up, hang up!

918
00:48:36,126 --> 00:48:38,542
We're just sitting down
to dinner.

919
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:40,459
Okay, please don't call again.

920
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:42,625
Thank you. Thank you.

921
00:48:45,292 --> 00:48:47,667
Bobby! Soph! Come on!

922
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:58,667
It's a G5.
It's got a 64-bit architecture.

923
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:00,990
They speak a different language
now with these computers.

924
00:49:01,042 --> 00:49:02,625
I saw a show on computers,

925
00:49:02,709 --> 00:49:04,292
how the prices
have dropped so low

926
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:06,792
that you can buy one
for $500 at Costco

927
00:49:06,876 --> 00:49:08,209
that's more powerful
than the one

928
00:49:08,292 --> 00:49:10,750
that they used to put
the astronauts on the moon.

929
00:49:11,834 --> 00:49:13,834
Good eggplant, Jan.

930
00:49:16,001 --> 00:49:17,333
Yeah, delicious.

931
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:22,709
Mm.

932
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:27,375
I wonder where Harpo's
eating his Sunday dinner.

933
00:49:29,292 --> 00:49:30,542
What?

934
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:35,333
Just wondering
what Harpo's up to.

935
00:49:35,417 --> 00:49:38,542
- Who's Harpo?
- That's Hal, Janice's son.

936
00:49:38,625 --> 00:49:41,209
- You have a son?
- You didn't tell us that.

937
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:53,625
You know that song
"Harpo's Song," by Phoebe Snow?

938
00:49:53,709 --> 00:49:56,084
'Cause that's the song
you named Harpo after, right?

939
00:49:58,168 --> 00:50:00,709
He's half
French-Canadian, Harpo.

940
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:04,126
All right, Tony, make fun
of a boy because of his name.

941
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,168
I wonder what's
French-Canadian for,

942
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:14,834
"I grew up without a mother."

943
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:24,709
"<i>Sacré bleu!</i>
Where is me mama?"

944
00:50:26,042 --> 00:50:27,333
You son of a fucking bitch!

945
00:50:27,417 --> 00:50:28,667
- You son of a bitch!
- Come on!

946
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,500
Daddy!

947
00:50:30,584 --> 00:50:32,333
Easy, easy, easy!

948
00:50:32,417 --> 00:50:34,416
- You miserable fuck!
- I don't got a right to ask?

949
00:50:34,417 --> 00:50:37,168
- I'm the boy's uncle!
- Easy, easy.

950
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,500
Easy. Easy.

951
00:50:43,584 --> 00:50:45,168
