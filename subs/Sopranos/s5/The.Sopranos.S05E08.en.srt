<i>New York's only classic rock

31
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:49,625
Look at this.

32
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,292
The house sang out to us
of both Miami and Taormina

33
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,667
where we had our honeymoon.

34
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,500
Nicole said, let's buy it.

35
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:59,750
Can just about smell the salt.

36
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:03,084
You mean the painting
or the view?

37
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:04,959
Both.

38
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,876
That's called
the "trumpay la oil."

39
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,542
Fool the eye.

40
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:12,625
It was done by an artist right
over here in West Hempstead.

41
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:14,709
I'll be damned.

42
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:17,292
Follow me, Jerry.

43
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,459
This little bitch is for you.

44
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:20,959
It's a Whirlpool Duet.

45
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:24,126
Top of the line. Same as mine.

46
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:26,084
Nicole is head over heels
with it.

47
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:27,792
This is above and beyond,
Carmine.

48
00:02:27,876 --> 00:02:31,292
Well, thank my father, too,
may he rest in peace.

49
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,250
This is for Freeport.

50
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,625
It's a token.

51
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,125
You know it's
my understanding, Carmine,

52
00:02:36,126 --> 00:02:38,084
that Johnny's still sore
about that.

53
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:40,667
That's why I appreciate
your support.

54
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,250
I'm moved up here now.

55
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,250
You and me are gonna
do great things together.

56
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,292
Amen.

57
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,584
Daddy! Daddy!

58
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,876
The boat is sinking!

59
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,126
Carmine! My God!

60
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,834
I just sailed her up
from Miami three weeks ago.

61
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,834
She was fine.

62
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:08,959
You should call
the coast guard, Carmine.

63
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:32,584
<i>Whoa!</i>

64
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:34,292
<i>Oh! Ow!</i>

65
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,209
Oh, shit.

66
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:44,584
It's okay, take it easy.

67
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:47,375
After all these years
of marriage,

68
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:48,791
you know what you find
yourself thinking

69
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:50,417
in your private moments...

70
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,333
Please, God, let me die first.

71
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:56,168
I don't wanna miss him.

72
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,750
Well, he's gonna be all right.

73
00:03:58,834 --> 00:04:02,084
You're lucky.

74
00:04:02,168 --> 00:04:06,084
In some way,
you've been spared that.

75
00:04:06,168 --> 00:04:09,584
Well, you and Tony
calling it quits now.

76
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:18,001
Maybe we should
cancel the party.

77
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:20,584
Maybe he'll be fine
by his birthday.

78
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:24,001
You know he's turning 75, Ma,
that's a milestone.

79
00:04:24,084 --> 00:04:25,126
Ooh.

80
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:28,168
He's got some bruising.

81
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,292
Very lucky man.

82
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,792
Those hedges broke his fall.

83
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:32,636
But a few days of rest
and he should be fine.

84
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:35,209
The neurologist is
giving him a final look,

85
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:36,532
and then you can take him home.

86
00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:38,375
Thank you so much, Doctor.

87
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,292
- You're welcome.
- Thank God.

88
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,959
Ooh.

89
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:44,709
His roofing days are over,
I'll tell you that right now.

90
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:46,392
I guess, huh?

91
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:52,834
So, uh, what do you
think about the party?

92
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,168
Jeez, Ma, I--

93
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,584
well, I think
we should go for it.

94
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:02,792
Well, what do you think
about inviting Tony?

95
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:04,792
Well, that's the thing.

96
00:05:04,876 --> 00:05:06,750
I don't know if I should or not.

97
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:09,168
Everybody would understand
if you didn't.

98
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,542
- You're separated.
- I know, I know.

99
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,265
But just the idea of
having a family party

100
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,750
in the backyard without Tony
there manning the grill,

101
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:19,126
playing host,
it wouldn't be the same.

102
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:21,834
Shh. It's gonna be okay, baby.

103
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:24,834
Why don't they take
care of this man?

104
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:31,917
I think it's
a very wise decision.

105
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:34,084
What decision?
I haven't made one.

106
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:37,001
I thought I heard
you say that you had.

107
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:38,625
That he wasn't coming.

108
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,001
Maserati.

109
00:05:47,084 --> 00:05:49,001
Kinda draws attention, no?

110
00:05:49,084 --> 00:05:52,624
Ah, true. Friends of ours, most
of 'em, probably wouldn't own it.

111
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,625
It was always a dream of mine

112
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:56,333
to own a fine
Italian sports car.

113
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:57,834
<i>A salut'</i> then.

114
00:05:57,917 --> 00:06:01,667
And in the guinea gray it,
uh, looks fantastic.

115
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,792
Tops out a 176 miles per hour.

116
00:06:04,876 --> 00:06:07,168
Standing quarter, 13 and change.

117
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,126
- How many horses?
- 390.

118
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:13,292
What'd that set
you back about, uh...

119
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,917
99 and change.

120
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:16,791
You're spendin' like
you're already on the throne.

121
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:20,834
- Had a good year.
- Oh, God bless.

122
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:23,667
While we're doin'
car talk here, Phil...

123
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,750
<i>Madonna mi',</i>
he won't let that thing go.

124
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:28,876
He owed me money
and he was duckin' me.

125
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,375
Look, I'm not
sayin' you're wrong.

126
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:32,019
Phil treats nickels
like manhole covers.

127
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:33,792
Believe me, I know.

128
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:35,332
But the captains loyal to me
need to know

129
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,126
I stand behind them right now.

130
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:40,126
Fuckin' Little Carmine.

131
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:42,250
This asshole's givin' away
washing machines.

132
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,001
You believe that?

133
00:06:44,084 --> 00:06:46,500
He don't have collision
insurance, fuckin' Phil?

134
00:06:46,584 --> 00:06:48,001
His son-in-law's a broker.

135
00:06:48,084 --> 00:06:51,709
They let it lapse
lookin' for a better rate.

136
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:54,375
Fuckin' idiot.

137
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:57,584
Tony, I ruled in your favor.

138
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,459
The racetrack.

139
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:01,333
The money Philly owed you.

140
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:02,917
Well, if I'm payin' for it,

141
00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:04,666
we do it at Pussy's
or we don't do it at all.

142
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:06,107
His wife's runnin'
the body shop now.

143
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:08,709
So I can at least
control expenses.

144
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:13,709
Thanks.

145
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:17,001
Come on.
Get in, take ya for a ride.

146
00:07:17,084 --> 00:07:18,625
Fuckin' thing's so powerful,

147
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:21,542
I had to take a lesson
from the dealer last night.

148
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:36,084
Pretty low.

149
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:37,584
How does Ginny like the car?

150
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:38,876
She loves it.

151
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,041
But she hasn't
driven with me yet.

152
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,708
With her knee, she has a
little trouble gettin' into the seat.

153
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:44,750
Oh.

154
00:07:48,126 --> 00:07:49,375
Whoa.

155
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,126
Tony. Hi.

156
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:12,709
Hey, Ang'. How are ya?

157
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,417
Good.

158
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:18,417
Listen, a friend of mine
banged up his car pretty good

159
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,959
so I was thinkin', you know,

160
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,417
maybe help us both out

161
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,542
and, uh, throw
a little business your way.

162
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:24,791
You didn't need to come down.

163
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,168
You just could've phoned me.

164
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,042
The thing is, I gotta
pay for the repairs.

165
00:08:28,126 --> 00:08:29,333
Long story.

166
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:31,042
I distracted him
while he was drivin'.

167
00:08:31,126 --> 00:08:33,333
Anyway, the point
bein' that, uh,

168
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:36,459
anything you can do
to keep costs in line,

169
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:38,375
would be a big help to me.

170
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:44,208
Well, you look like
you're doin' pretty good

171
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:45,959
since we had
that phone call, uh,

172
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:49,084
you know, you asked me could
you take over Puss's body shop.

173
00:08:49,168 --> 00:08:50,876
Thank you for that, Tony.

174
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,500
You didn't have to say yes,

175
00:08:52,584 --> 00:08:55,917
with all the other kinda
business you do through here.

176
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:57,542
Uh, anyway, his name is Phil,

177
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,917
and, uh, Carmela sends her love.

178
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:01,333
Please say hello...

179
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,876
Finally.

180
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:28,584
I left a message
I was gonna come by.

181
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:30,250
Well, I got in late.

182
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:38,168
Girl called in sick.

183
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,168
You should get a new one.

184
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,917
Have a seat.

185
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:50,625
May I get you anything?

186
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:59,584
How's your father?

187
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,268
Much better.

188
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,042
Oh, thanks.

189
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:13,375
He'll be fine for
the party, thank God.

190
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,750
Well, that's good.

191
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:21,500
What party?

192
00:10:21,584 --> 00:10:23,084
75th birthday?

193
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:25,408
You know, the surprise party
we talked about last summer?

194
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,876
Oh, yeah, that's comin' up?

195
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,876
- Yeah, next Saturday.
- Oh.

196
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:33,792
But actually that's
why I wanted to come by.

197
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:37,834
'Cause I think maybe
it would be best--

198
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:41,292
be easier, anyway,
for both of us, if uh...

199
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,625
If I went at it alone.

200
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,792
And not have you there.

201
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,250
Oh, yeah.

202
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,916
Uh, you know my father
would love to have you there,

203
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:55,083
you know he's crazy
about your sausages

204
00:10:55,084 --> 00:10:58,084
and all the rest of it, but...

205
00:10:58,168 --> 00:11:00,084
I thought, uh, you know,
why put us and--

206
00:11:00,168 --> 00:11:03,084
and people in an
uncomfortable situation.

207
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:04,417
Well, I decided right away

208
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,625
when we broke up
I wasn't comin'.

209
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,375
Really?

210
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:15,126
I'm so glad you understand.

211
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:16,959
It was hard for me
to come to this decision,

212
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:18,709
let alone tell you.

213
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:24,459
Well, I'd like
to contribute, anyway.

214
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:26,022
No, Mom and I are
taking care of it.

215
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:28,542
For Hugh's 75th? I insist.

216
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:32,084
You know, I would rather see
you go back to your therapist.

217
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:33,959
I'd like to see you
go to a therapist.

218
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:35,876
And I'm not the only one.

219
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:37,625
- Oh, really?
- Mm.

220
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:39,789
Well, you can tell them all
that I can't afford it.

221
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:41,541
Well, it's not really
your business anymore,

222
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:44,126
whether I go or what!

223
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:10,876
Brought you some
Danish and coffee.

224
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,250
Fuckin' medication.
I can't think.

225
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,459
Can't stay awake.

226
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:18,792
It don't have that side effect.

227
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:20,292
But it'll help your outlook

228
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,792
if you take it consistently
like you're supposed to.

229
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:27,542
What's on?

230
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,292
It said in the guide
it's an Italian movie.

231
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,459
But even with the captions,
I can't tell what's what.

232
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:35,917
They had Jesus hangin'
off a helicopter.

233
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:39,168
But you could tell
it was a dummy.

234
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,250
You know who I saw
at the bakery?

235
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,459
How the fuck could I know?

236
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:45,792
Rosalie Aprile.

237
00:12:45,876 --> 00:12:47,167
Said they're havin'
a surprise party

238
00:12:47,168 --> 00:12:49,250
for Carmela's father next week.

239
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,333
He's gonna be 75.

240
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:53,250
You get an invite?

241
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,625
No, but we go way back
to when Moses wore short pants.

242
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,750
I better call Hugh.

243
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:04,375
Tell him not to expect me.

244
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:06,667
It's a surprise party, Jun'.

245
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,625
What, are we children?

246
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:13,292
Anyway, at our age
it's enough surprise

247
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,959
we're still alive every morning.

248
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:16,876
<i>What city and state, please?</i>

249
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,459
In West Orange.

250
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:21,542
DeAngelis, Hugo.

251
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,792
<i>The call can automatically
be completed by pressing one,</i>

252
00:13:24,876 --> 00:13:28,792
<i>for an additional charge
of .35¢.</i>

253
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:32,542
The fuck.
It's over anyhow.

254
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,042
Hello?

255
00:13:38,126 --> 00:13:40,001
Hugo,<i> como esta?</i>

256
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:41,375
Who is this?

257
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:42,792
<i>Corrado. Soprano.</i>

258
00:13:42,876 --> 00:13:44,333
Oh, ho ho ho.

259
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:47,417
Corrado. How are ya?

260
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,550
How am I.

261
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:52,001
I'm a prisoner in my own home,
Hugh, is how I am.

262
00:13:52,084 --> 00:13:54,209
<i>What do we live for?</i>

263
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,709
Yeah.

264
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:58,333
Anyhow, I wanted
to wish you a<i> buona fortuna,</i>

265
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:00,333
and also send you my regrets.

266
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:02,584
I'd love to be at your jubilee.

267
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:03,584
Junior.

268
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:05,250
Jubilee?

269
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,366
<i>But the federal government says I can't </i>

270
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,249
leave the house,

271
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,667
and my family keeps me sedated.

272
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,250
<i>Bobby told me
it was a surprise party</i>

273
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,709
<i>but I told him, I go,</i>

274
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:15,750
<i>at our age it's enough surprise</i>

275
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:17,462
<i>every day when we get up
in the mornin',</i>

276
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:18,776
right?

277
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,168
Oh, I suppose so.

278
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,126
So happy birthday, my friend,
and many more.

279
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:25,625
<i>Arrivederci.</i>

280
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:40,209
<i>♪ Maybe you won't
recognize me now ♪</i>

281
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:45,168
<i>♪ Maybe you won't
recognize me now... ♪</i>

282
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:50,666
To think, when I got
outta the joint,

283
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:53,134
I thought an airbag
was Paulie Walnuts.

284
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:55,801
How we do this week?

285
00:14:56,084 --> 00:14:57,084
Good.

286
00:14:57,168 --> 00:14:58,374
The Acura dealer,
what's his name,

287
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,542
he took 20 units.

288
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,333
Carlo gave me the okay to make

289
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:04,333
some personnel changes
at the warehouse.

290
00:15:06,584 --> 00:15:07,917
Your call.

291
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:13,709
I don't know.
The airbag thing.

292
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:15,084
It earns good.

293
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:19,375
It's not hard work,
Christ knows, but...

294
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:20,917
But what?

295
00:15:21,001 --> 00:15:23,842
Think I could be of a lot
more service to you in other areas.

296
00:15:23,926 --> 00:15:25,791
And gettin' straightened out
wouldn't hurt neither.

297
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:30,042
Just eat what's on
your plate right now.

298
00:15:30,126 --> 00:15:32,084
I mean, Christ,
what's it been, a month?

299
00:15:32,168 --> 00:15:33,417
I'm a team player, cousin.

300
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,333
I'm Charlie Hustle.

301
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:37,459
If that's what you want,
I'll do it.

302
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:39,876
Look.

303
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,168
If you need some money...

304
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,001
Get the fuck outta here.

305
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:47,909
All right.

306
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:51,001
Let's go get a drink.

307
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:55,459
What should I get Hugh
DeAngelis for his birthday?

308
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:57,292
I was thinkin' cigars
but then I figured

309
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,075
you were probably
gonna bring some.

310
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,625
Well, actually
I decided not to go.

311
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:06,001
In light of the situation,
I went, I saw Carm,

312
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:09,584
I told her I thought
it'd be best if I sit it out.

313
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:28,042
Hi, Phil. Joe.

314
00:16:28,126 --> 00:16:30,834
Where's your
brother-in-law, doll?

315
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:34,126
I wouldn't know.

316
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:37,168
Hey, Phillip,
how the hell are ya?

317
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,459
How's the neck?

318
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:40,001
Where's the car?

319
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:42,542
We all passed a lotta water
since the old days, huh?

320
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:46,001
I was away when all that shit
went down with your brother.

321
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:48,625
What the fuck happened?

322
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:51,042
We don't like to talk about it.

323
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:52,709
Your car's in here, Phil.

324
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,750
It's all set.

325
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:06,542
What the fuck is this?

326
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:12,750
It was a front-end
collision, Phil.

327
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:14,625
This new paint
isn't as brilliant.

328
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:16,792
It's factory paint,
same as original.

329
00:17:16,876 --> 00:17:19,292
It is different, it's duller.

330
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:30,375
Something's off with the seat.

331
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:32,375
What is it, Phil?

332
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:34,126
Feels off kilter.

333
00:17:34,209 --> 00:17:36,292
Try it, Joey.

334
00:17:46,584 --> 00:17:48,667
You're right; it's off its axis.

335
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,542
It reclines strange too.

336
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,084
Try it.

337
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:55,126
Nobody said anything
about the seats.

338
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:56,876
This is unacceptable.

339
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,792
Come on, Joey.

340
00:17:58,876 --> 00:18:00,083
Give me a call when you
get the job done, all right?

341
00:18:00,084 --> 00:18:01,959
A couple of days, Phil.

342
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:04,834
Phil, we did
what was asked of us.

343
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,876
Call me when it's done right.

344
00:18:12,584 --> 00:18:13,750
So Dad,

345
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:15,542
how does dinner
at Vesuvio's sound

346
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:16,666
for your birthday next week?

347
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:17,917
Just us.

348
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:19,542
We'll come here first
for the presents,

349
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,042
and then we'll go over there.

350
00:18:22,126 --> 00:18:24,584
Sure, sure.

351
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,333
That sounds fine.

352
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,292
Did somebody tell you something?

353
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,709
I know all about it.

354
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:34,625
You can save
the cloak and dagger.

355
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:36,349
AJ!

356
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:38,168
Huh, what?

357
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,750
Junior Soprano
told me all about it.

358
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:42,209
That miserable fucking man.

359
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:43,168
Ugh!

360
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,542
You don't know the half.

361
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,709
Relax.

362
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,042
I'm fine with knowin'.

363
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,333
At my age, it's surprise enough

364
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:51,876
to be able to get
outta bed every morning.

365
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:54,001
So who's comin' to this shindig?

366
00:18:54,084 --> 00:18:55,625
God damn him!

367
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:59,168
All of us, your brother,
Lester, Dr. Fegoli...

368
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,625
Russ Fegoli? He's in town?

369
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:03,542
He retired from
the foreign service.

370
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,750
But they were livin' out
in Marin Country or wherever.

371
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:08,625
Well, they settled on Jersey.

372
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:13,001
Octavia, the oldest, lives here.

373
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:14,792
Wait, who's Dr. Fago?

374
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:17,209
Fegoli. Feg.

375
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:19,917
She of the five-page
Christmas card.

376
00:19:20,001 --> 00:19:21,375
"...And on Flag Day,

377
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:24,834
Papa Russ shook hands
with Andrew Cuomo..."

378
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:26,792
What an honor. BFD.

379
00:19:26,876 --> 00:19:29,126
The Fegoli kids
finished college.

380
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,084
That's what sticks in your craw.

381
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:32,709
What sticks in my craw is that

382
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:34,084
when he got that medal

383
00:19:34,168 --> 00:19:35,416
you two weren't even
invited to the ceremony.

384
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:37,459
It was out in California.

385
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:40,842
They knew that your father
doesn't like to be out of his element.

386
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:47,126
Now, here's someone we can
all be proud of, Anthony.

387
00:19:47,209 --> 00:19:50,168
Dr. Fegoli served
in the state department.

388
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,876
In Rome, he was career assistant

389
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:54,084
to the ambassador
to the Vatican.

390
00:19:54,168 --> 00:19:56,333
He got a medal
from the Pope himself.

391
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:57,792
Wow.

392
00:19:57,876 --> 00:19:59,583
But when we were kids
together in the Navy,

393
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:01,292
he had such a bad
case of the crabs

394
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,417
we used to call him
the governor of Maryland.

395
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,084
Hey, Hugh,
stop acting like a child.

396
00:20:06,168 --> 00:20:08,042
Oh, lighten up.
He's old enough to hear.

397
00:20:08,126 --> 00:20:09,876
She's right, knock it off.

398
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:13,250
Who else is comin'?

399
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,500
Freddy Di Novi...

400
00:20:14,584 --> 00:20:16,126
Tony'll love him.

401
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,834
Who else?

402
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:23,209
Dad, Tony isn't
coming to the party.

403
00:20:23,292 --> 00:20:24,876
Why won't he come?

404
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,876
Well, I felt that, uh,
since we're separated,

405
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,500
we should get used to the idea
of living separate lives.

406
00:20:30,584 --> 00:20:31,834
Oh, that's a crock a shit.

407
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:33,208
Hugh, don't talk
to her like that.

408
00:20:33,209 --> 00:20:34,667
This is very difficult for her.

409
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,470
I've known the man
for 20-something years!

410
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:38,168
It's his house!
How's it gonna look?

411
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,500
I talked to Tony about it;
he's in agreement with me.

412
00:20:40,584 --> 00:20:42,459
Because you put
the screws to him.

413
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:44,001
Fine, I'll cancel the party.

414
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:45,833
Go right the hell ahead
because I'm not comin'

415
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:47,917
if the man of the house
isn't there.

416
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:52,917
Yeah?

417
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,500
<i>Tony, it's Angie.</i>

418
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:57,209
We did all the repairs
you said on Phil's car.

419
00:20:57,292 --> 00:21:00,168
He came today and now he found
a dent in the rear.

420
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,084
<i>His seat, there's
a problem with that.</i>

421
00:21:02,168 --> 00:21:03,375
His seat?

422
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:04,541
I didn't wanna get
into these extras

423
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:06,292
without checking with you.

424
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,667
<i>Ang', honey, you wanna run
a body shop, run a body shop.</i>

425
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,750
You said could you claim
your piece of the garage.

426
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:12,750
So you wanna be
a woman in business,

427
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:15,084
then do what you think
the situation calls for.

428
00:21:15,168 --> 00:21:16,666
I just wanna put
my kids through college.

429
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,375
<i>That's a good thing, Ang'.</i>

430
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:22,375
You know some women left alone
like that would've given up.

431
00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:24,584
Tony, before I outlay
for these costs,

432
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:26,250
yeah, I need to know--

433
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,459
Ang', I'm not there,
what do I know?

434
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:30,126
It's your call.

435
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:47,834
Ton'? What's up?

436
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:50,375
Pussy's body shop is
one of your stops, right?

437
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:52,500
Well they're fixin'
the fuckin' Shah of Iran's car.

438
00:21:52,584 --> 00:21:55,126
Uh, can you be there
when he picks it up?

439
00:21:55,209 --> 00:21:56,709
<i>Make sure he's happy,
but don't let</i>

440
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:58,332
<i>the shit spiral out of control.</i>

441
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,917
Right. I'll take care of it.

442
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:01,001
<i>Thanks.</i>

443
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:05,625
On my way to Welsh Farms,
get a triple blueberry sundae.

444
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:07,375
Good for you.

445
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,084
Enjoy.

446
00:22:09,168 --> 00:22:11,126
Hot summer night.

447
00:22:12,168 --> 00:22:14,375
Go for it. You deserve it.

448
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:17,250
All right, yeah.
I'll talk to ya later.

449
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:23,333
- Opus.
- Fine choice.

450
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,250
Angelo, here,
spoke very highly of you

451
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:30,292
and how you handled yourself
with him in Pennsylvania.

452
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:32,168
That's why I wanted to meet you.

453
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,250
We were like Frick and Frack
in the can.

454
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,001
Angelo's my buddy.

455
00:22:37,084 --> 00:22:39,459
He knew all the Jackie
Gleason stuff by heart.

456
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:41,292
He acted all the parts hisself.

457
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:42,792
Do a little bit for Rusty.

458
00:22:42,876 --> 00:22:44,542
The mambo thing.

459
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,750
Mambo?

460
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:51,959
Oh! Carlos was teaching
you the mambo?

461
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:54,542
That's a different story!

462
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,959
Get out! Get out!

463
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:02,541
So how's your reentry been?

464
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:03,667
You doin' okay?

465
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,917
Yeah.
Tony's been good with me.

466
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:07,834
I always liked your cousin.

467
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:09,584
He's a real gentleman.

468
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:12,375
Angelo's lookin'
out for you, too.

469
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:16,709
I told Rusty that you
might need a little earn.

470
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:19,625
Well, yeah, I could use
a little cash injection.

471
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:21,417
Maybe a push up the pyramid.

472
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,250
You know, time served.

473
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:27,667
We need somethin' done.

474
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,126
Nice little payday for you,

475
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:35,126
and an opportunity for you to
hone that rep you left behind.

476
00:23:35,209 --> 00:23:36,625
And this involves...

477
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:39,750
Somebody needs to go.

478
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:42,500
Anyone I know?

479
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,292
New York guy, not Jersey.

480
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,001
Who's he with?

481
00:23:50,084 --> 00:23:51,209
Friend of a friend.

482
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:53,417
Not a friend of ours.

483
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:58,168
Friend of Johnny's.

484
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,459
You guys gotta settle that shit.

485
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:02,542
It's not the boat.

486
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,168
It's not the boat.

487
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,001
It's Lorraine Calluzzo.

488
00:24:06,084 --> 00:24:08,209
Rainey Calluzzo.

489
00:24:08,292 --> 00:24:11,584
Little Carmine
went to school with her.

490
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:15,333
They go back that far.

491
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:17,834
Kill a woman. Come on.

492
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:28,126
I can't sign on right now.

493
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:31,042
I wanna give my cousin
the benefit of the doubt.

494
00:24:31,126 --> 00:24:34,584
He don't want us involved in
this problem over here anyway.

495
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:37,209
Why don't you think about it
for a bit?

496
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:39,834
I don't know.
I don't think so.

497
00:24:39,917 --> 00:24:42,459
But thanks, guys.

498
00:24:42,542 --> 00:24:44,222
We had a big talk
over here the other day

499
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,709
and the consensus seems
to want your presence

500
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:48,375
at my father's party.

501
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:51,084
Well, that's nice but
it's kinda short notice now.

502
00:24:51,168 --> 00:24:53,792
<i>Look, it's for
my father, not me.</i>

503
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:56,333
I made plans

504
00:24:56,357 --> 00:24:57,692
<i>to go fishin' with Sil.</i>

505
00:24:57,876 --> 00:24:59,500
Well, he really wants you there.

506
00:24:59,584 --> 00:25:00,875
If you could find a
way to make it,

507
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:04,092
I know he would be very happy.

508
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:06,084
He's very fond of you.

509
00:25:06,168 --> 00:25:07,853
The New York <i>salsicc',</i>

510
00:25:07,877 --> 00:25:09,750
<i>hickory wood, whatever.</i>

511
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:11,209
You're not usin' Artie?

512
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:13,584
<i>Yeah, I got him doin'
appetizers and salads,</i>

513
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:15,209
<i>but, uh, he's really there
as a guest.</i>

514
00:25:15,292 --> 00:25:17,500
I am cooking.

515
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:18,834
Tomorrow's gonna be a madhouse,

516
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,476
just, living hell.

517
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:25,876
I don't know, I'll...

518
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:28,876
I'll see what I can do.

519
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:31,342
Thank you, Tony,
I appreciate it.

520
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,459
Uh, Jerry say to refrigerate.

521
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:43,084
Okay. I think there is
room in the garage.

522
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,292
- Hey, Carm.
- Tony.

523
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:54,209
I know you're shorthanded, uh,

524
00:25:54,292 --> 00:25:56,000
I thought you might need
some help around here today.

525
00:25:56,001 --> 00:25:57,201
It's my weekend with the boys.

526
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,370
They'll stay out of the way.

527
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:09,001
Aunt Carmela's nice enough
to let you guys enjoy her pool,

528
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:11,333
and you wanna
destroy her property.

529
00:26:11,417 --> 00:26:14,250
It's a beach chair.
It can get wet.

530
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,750
Don't get smart!

531
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:16,917
You wanna go home?

532
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,084
What can I do?

533
00:26:28,168 --> 00:26:31,375
Ah, the dips.
I forgot the dips.

534
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:33,126
I gotta duck out later.

535
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:34,959
I could pick some up
for you at Grand Union.

536
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:37,333
Grand Union closed
its doors 10 years ago.

537
00:26:37,417 --> 00:26:38,792
You know what, frig the dip.

538
00:26:38,876 --> 00:26:40,476
They're gonna have
to survive with salsa.

539
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:43,250
Can I make you a cocktail?

540
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:45,792
I make a mean Rusty Nail.

541
00:26:45,876 --> 00:26:48,792
Now? No.

542
00:26:48,876 --> 00:26:51,084
Thanks again for lettin'
the kids take a swim.

543
00:26:51,168 --> 00:26:52,375
Aw, sure.

544
00:26:52,459 --> 00:26:54,084
Anytime, you know that.

545
00:26:56,168 --> 00:26:57,209
Cheers.

546
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:02,709
They love bein' here.

547
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:05,417
This is truly a beautiful home.

548
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,417
What, are you here,
five years now?

549
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,792
I asked you to get up at 11:00.

550
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:12,667
We got a lot to do today.

551
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,459
Well, you were supposed to send
this to Mr. Wegler for summer school.

552
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:17,542
Put it down!

553
00:27:20,584 --> 00:27:21,792
Greetings, birthday people.

554
00:27:21,876 --> 00:27:23,584
You are here, which is great.

555
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:24,959
You can help with the set-up.

556
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:26,959
- Hi, Mrs. Soprano.
- Hi.

557
00:27:27,042 --> 00:27:28,792
Uh, uh, Finn this
is our Uncle Tony.

558
00:27:28,876 --> 00:27:30,584
Tony this is
Meadow's friend, Finn.

559
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:32,042
Hey.

560
00:27:32,126 --> 00:27:33,709
What are you doing?

561
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:36,667
I'm making grandpa's favorite
maple-walnut icebox cake.

562
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,250
We have cake. Jerry just--

563
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:40,459
Why don't you take a swim?
I know you're hot.

564
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:43,126
Do you have a towel?

565
00:27:43,209 --> 00:27:45,126
I'll bring you a coffee, too.

566
00:27:45,209 --> 00:27:47,750
- I'll be outside.
- Cake pan?

567
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:50,459
Meadow, I have
a lot to do today.

568
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:53,492
Hello?
I'm making dessert, to help?

569
00:27:54,876 --> 00:27:56,584
Seems like a nice guy.

570
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:58,417
Yep.

571
00:28:07,168 --> 00:28:10,333
- Any luck with Kelly?
- No.

572
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:13,292
I been scourin'
the internet for any trace.

573
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:15,209
Here is your cake pan.

574
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:21,209
And you're gonna
clean up your baking mess.

575
00:28:28,084 --> 00:28:30,459
I can imagine how much
you must miss her.

576
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,584
Your only daughter.

577
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:35,667
What was she like 11
when she lived with you guys?

578
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,375
We had her 12th birthday party

579
00:28:37,459 --> 00:28:39,168
right before she moved out.

580
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:44,042
How'd she do
in school back then?

581
00:28:44,126 --> 00:28:45,209
Straight A's.

582
00:28:45,292 --> 00:28:47,292
Oh, my God, what is
the matter with them?

583
00:28:53,709 --> 00:28:55,750
Don't lift that by yourself,
Hugh.

584
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,325
Wait for some help.

585
00:28:58,709 --> 00:28:59,834
What are you doing here?

586
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:01,042
You always do this!

587
00:29:01,126 --> 00:29:02,584
The party is not for hours!

588
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:04,834
- He needs help.
- What am I doin' here?

589
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:06,000
I'm returning your port-a-vac.

590
00:29:06,001 --> 00:29:07,001
You said you needed it.

591
00:29:07,084 --> 00:29:08,375
Happy birthday, Grandpa.

592
00:29:08,459 --> 00:29:10,250
Later for that,
get your uncle out here.

593
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,416
He left; he said he told you
he had to bolt for a minute.

594
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,959
He asked us to watch the twins.

595
00:29:19,584 --> 00:29:21,375
Here, help me with this.

596
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,292
Oh, my goodness, what a bother.

597
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,209
Excuse us for living.

598
00:29:30,126 --> 00:29:32,333
How ya doin'? I'm Tony.

599
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:35,500
Oh, yeah, the other
Tony's cousin, right?

600
00:29:35,584 --> 00:29:37,209
It reclines perfectly, try it.

601
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:38,834
Fuck that.

602
00:29:38,917 --> 00:29:40,876
I don't feel like
I'm sittin' at 12:00.

603
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:43,126
You're sittin' at 12:00.

604
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:44,584
May I?

605
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:46,042
I don't give a fuck.

606
00:29:46,126 --> 00:29:49,459
You can sit in there
till fuckin' St. Gennaro.

607
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:51,042
It'll still need
to be dealt with.

608
00:29:51,126 --> 00:29:53,667
This car went through
a major collision.

609
00:29:58,001 --> 00:29:59,209
Seems okay.

610
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:02,168
How could it be okay
if it's askew?

611
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:07,827
What's the matter, Joey?
You got a fuckin' eye problem?

612
00:30:07,876 --> 00:30:10,168
Look like Stevie Wonder,
your eyes rollin' around.

613
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,459
Aw, what'd I say?
I didn't say nothin', Phil.

614
00:30:12,542 --> 00:30:14,292
Replacin' the seat
will cost a fortune.

615
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:16,001
Give me a break, Phil.

616
00:30:16,084 --> 00:30:17,292
The seat is fine.

617
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:18,833
You just have a problem
with the grain

618
00:30:18,834 --> 00:30:20,114
on the leather from the factory.

619
00:30:20,126 --> 00:30:21,375
You think I'm stupid?

620
00:30:21,459 --> 00:30:22,375
Ho, ho!

621
00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:23,709
Don't take it out on me.

622
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:25,126
Come on, Joey.

623
00:30:25,209 --> 00:30:27,709
Hey, Phil.

624
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,417
Now, how about this.

625
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,584
They replace the tracks
under the seat,

626
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:33,500
maybe throw in
a CD player in the dash.

627
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:36,417
We already did that.
We replaced the tracks.

628
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,792
He's got a CD player.

629
00:30:37,876 --> 00:30:39,333
Jesus God, Duke,

630
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:43,001
they're hosin' us for
a $2,000 factory seat.

631
00:30:43,084 --> 00:30:44,917
Come on, Joey.

632
00:30:45,001 --> 00:30:46,333
Tony, nice to meet ya.

633
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:48,209
Come on, you comin'?

634
00:30:48,292 --> 00:30:50,459
Joe, try to keep
him cooled down.

635
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,168
Here ya go, Freddy.

636
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,292
Get it, Jason, come on!

637
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,126
Oh.

638
00:31:24,709 --> 00:31:26,667
Oh, my God.

639
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,750
Ma, what?

640
00:31:27,792 --> 00:31:29,417
Dr. Fegoli, Russ.

641
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,042
- What?
- He's allergic to tomatoes.

642
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:34,292
All right, so we
will deal with it.

643
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:36,209
Jesus.

644
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:39,792
Don't you have any hors
d'oeuvres without tomatoes?

645
00:31:39,876 --> 00:31:41,209
The prosciutto-wrapped chevre.

646
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:43,001
Rosalie just took 'em out.

647
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:51,084
An Italian allergic
to pommodori.

648
00:31:51,168 --> 00:31:52,209
<i>Dio mio.</i>

649
00:31:52,292 --> 00:31:53,375
You have my sympathies.

650
00:31:53,459 --> 00:31:55,126
Well, it wasn't
always like this.

651
00:31:55,209 --> 00:31:58,834
Started when they gave me
radiation for my prostate.

652
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,542
Don't ask me why.

653
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:02,459
So did you know Monsignor Kelly?

654
00:32:02,542 --> 00:32:04,750
He was in charge of the tours
at all the catacombs?

655
00:32:04,834 --> 00:32:06,834
I made you a plate, Russ.

656
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:08,250
Thank you, Mary.

657
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:10,792
You know, Carmela's
mother-in-law, Livia,

658
00:32:10,876 --> 00:32:12,917
detested northern cooking.

659
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:13,917
Really, why?

660
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:15,834
She skeeved the butter.

661
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:17,709
The father was like that, too.

662
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:19,542
The whole Soprano
bunch over there.

663
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:22,750
So many<i> neopolitans</i> and
<i>sigilian'</i> feel that way.

664
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:25,292
Well, you really have
to go to Italy to know,

665
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:27,042
and so many of them don't.

666
00:32:27,126 --> 00:32:30,126
I ate like a champ all
the way up and down the boot.

667
00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:31,792
The whole two weeks.

668
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:34,834
But those recipes that you
used to send me from Tuscany.

669
00:32:34,917 --> 00:32:36,209
Lena...

670
00:32:36,292 --> 00:32:37,959
My God, they were a revelation.

671
00:32:38,042 --> 00:32:40,709
<i>Bollito misto, osso bucco...</i>

672
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,417
Mmm.

673
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,834
The lovely Carmela Soprano.

674
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:45,167
Would you like
to say a few words?

675
00:32:45,168 --> 00:32:46,292
Oh, he's back, thank God.

676
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:47,917
Will you get
the guests arriving?

677
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:49,001
See?

678
00:32:49,084 --> 00:32:50,250
And where the hell is Tony?

679
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:51,542
Have a glass of wine, Carm.

680
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:52,959
Calm you down a little.

681
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:54,917
He is bringing the charcoal
and the sausage.

682
00:32:55,001 --> 00:32:56,416
He's always gotta wait
till the last minute.

683
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:58,126
I heard that!

684
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,584
- Agh, finally.
- Hi, Tony.

685
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:02,625
Got no faith in me.

686
00:33:02,709 --> 00:33:04,417
I wonder why?

687
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,001
Pins and needles,
needles and pins.

688
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,750
Palumbo's.

689
00:33:11,834 --> 00:33:12,954
The birthday boy's favorite.

690
00:33:13,001 --> 00:33:15,250
- Where is he?
- He's out back.

691
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:16,876
Oh, good.

692
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:18,709
Honey, try to pace yourself...

693
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:20,416
<i>♪ 'Fritto misto bacala,</i>
a couple of meatballs too ♪

694
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:22,042
Hey, there he is!

695
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:26,917
Hey, happy birthday to Hugh,
got<i> sazeecha</i> for you!

696
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:32,500
Russ, wait'll ya
taste this stuff.

697
00:33:32,584 --> 00:33:34,168
There's nothin' else like it.

698
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,374
Tony, I want you to meet
a couple of our oldest friends,

699
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:38,959
Dr. Russ and Lena Fegoli.

700
00:33:39,042 --> 00:33:40,417
Nice to meet you, sir.

701
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,792
My son-in-law, well,
whatever, Tony Soprano.

702
00:33:43,876 --> 00:33:45,459
Hey.

703
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:47,001
A doctor in the house, huh?

704
00:33:47,084 --> 00:33:48,625
That's good, 'cause somebody
usually

705
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:49,834
goes down at these things.

706
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:51,542
He's just joking.

707
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:56,126
Unfortunately my doctorate
is in international affairs.

708
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:57,500
Oh.

709
00:33:57,584 --> 00:33:59,126
From Princeton.

710
00:33:59,209 --> 00:34:00,667
G.I. Bill.

711
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:03,834
So you're a doctor like,
uh, Kissinger's a doctor.

712
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,001
- Yes.
- Oh.

713
00:34:06,084 --> 00:34:09,292
Russ had an audience
with four popes.

714
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:10,584
Oh.

715
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:12,168
What section did you all sit in?

716
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,625
Aw, idiot.

717
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,042
T.B., make sure you
shoot the food tables

718
00:34:17,126 --> 00:34:19,792
before they're pillaged.

719
00:34:19,876 --> 00:34:21,292
Well, I'd, uh...

720
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:24,250
Love to stay and chat,
but I got a fire to start.

721
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:25,209
Nice to meet ya, Doc.

722
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:27,126
Nice to meet you.

723
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,375
Everybody!

724
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:39,750
Could you gather 'round please?

725
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:42,542
Everybody, everybody!

726
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,126
Come on over.

727
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:51,209
I would like to make a toast
to the man of the hour.

728
00:34:51,292 --> 00:34:53,959
A very special man.

729
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:55,417
A man who I love

730
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,250
more than words
could possibly say.

731
00:34:58,333 --> 00:34:59,917
My father.
- Here-here.

732
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:03,709
You are the best father
and grandfather in the world.

733
00:35:06,792 --> 00:35:08,001
<i>- Salut'.
- Salut'.</i>

734
00:35:08,084 --> 00:35:09,709
<i>Salut'.</i>

735
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:11,084
Speech! Speech!

736
00:35:11,168 --> 00:35:13,667
You are the greatest,
my little Melly.

737
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,084
Oh.

738
00:35:15,168 --> 00:35:16,876
- Thank you for everything.
- Mm-hmm.

739
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:20,792
Tony, thank you for
having us at your home.

740
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:28,209
Mar', my lovely bride.

741
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,876
Still the prettiest girl
in the world.

742
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:33,333
Thank you for puttin' up
with me all these years.

743
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:37,667
Aww.

744
00:35:42,042 --> 00:35:43,959
Thank all you freeloaders
for coming!

745
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,624
So why don't you
open up your gifts, Dad?

746
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:52,834
Not now, Carmela,

747
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,333
It's very, uh, mercenary.

748
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:57,917
Well, good, people
spent money on them.

749
00:35:58,001 --> 00:36:00,250
I'll break the ice.

750
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:02,168
Here.

751
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,375
Open this one.

752
00:36:03,459 --> 00:36:04,792
It's from him.

753
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:09,001
Aw, you're too much.

754
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:19,392
A Stratocaster?

755
00:36:21,876 --> 00:36:23,750
Aww.

756
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:25,126
A Beretta.

757
00:36:25,209 --> 00:36:27,876
Ooh, aww...

758
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:30,168
Shotgun, oh wow.

759
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,333
This is...

760
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:32,917
I don't know what to say.

761
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:35,709
It's a Giubileo 12-gauge.

762
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,209
28-inch barrel.

763
00:36:41,084 --> 00:36:43,584
Nice to have money.

764
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:45,717
Get me another
Rolling Rock, Jay.

765
00:36:47,001 --> 00:36:48,876
What time did you
start drinkin' today?

766
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:51,542
Probably right after you got up.

767
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:53,168
Oh, cuz!

768
00:36:54,459 --> 00:36:56,000
Tony, can you bring
the camera over here

769
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:57,750
and get a shot of this?

770
00:36:57,834 --> 00:36:59,917
Sure, I got nothin'
better to do.

771
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,250
Expect a freezer full
of venison this year.

772
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:12,001
You got it, kid.

773
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,750
Beautiful piece.

774
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:31,333
The over-under action,
the engraving,

775
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:32,876
they're artisans.

776
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:37,792
And you know, I've been to
the Beretta studio in Brescia.

777
00:37:37,876 --> 00:37:40,959
No kiddin'.
I'd love to see that.

778
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:43,876
You know that company
goes back to the 1500s.

779
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:46,084
<i>Madonn'.</i>

780
00:37:46,168 --> 00:37:48,584
Sure, the best pieces,

781
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,542
they never export, you see.

782
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:59,542
I want one and all here to know

783
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:02,792
what a wild man
Hugo was in his day.

784
00:38:02,876 --> 00:38:05,375
Remember what he did at the
bund meeting in Paterson, Russ?

785
00:38:05,459 --> 00:38:08,126
Threw that cherry bomb
on those Krauts?

786
00:38:08,209 --> 00:38:09,792
Yeah, tell that one.

787
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:16,459
You made my father's year
with that gun.

788
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:19,209
He deserves it.

789
00:38:22,168 --> 00:38:24,459
You look beat, Tony;
why don't you take a break?

790
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:27,209
Nah, I'm all right.

791
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:31,126
Could use a beer, though.

792
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,459
Well, you got it.

793
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:44,292
Thanks.

794
00:38:44,876 --> 00:38:46,001
<i>Salut</i>'.

795
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:03,042
How's that look? Done?

796
00:39:03,126 --> 00:39:05,209
You're the grillmeister.

797
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:14,667
I mean, don't get me wrong.

798
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,500
I still think we have the
greatest legal system in the world.

799
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:19,500
But it's becoming more
and more discriminatory.

800
00:39:19,584 --> 00:39:22,459
I mean, if you're
a minority, or worse,

801
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:24,500
an immigrant from
an Arab country,

802
00:39:24,584 --> 00:39:26,250
civil rights don't apply at all.

803
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:28,584
No place is the breach
of civil rights

804
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:30,500
more evident than
the penal system.

805
00:39:30,584 --> 00:39:32,250
Rehabilitation? Please.

806
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:33,834
Yeah.

807
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:36,077
The nature of the system
instills a convict mentality

808
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:39,126
to the point where prison
becomes the only venue

809
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,625
where the convict can function.

810
00:39:41,709 --> 00:39:43,542
My little bleedin' heart.

811
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:46,084
She is wise beyond her years.

812
00:39:46,168 --> 00:39:47,250
She better be.

813
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:48,667
All the money I'm spendin' over

814
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:52,625
at liberal university
in sunny Harlem.

815
00:39:52,709 --> 00:39:54,001
Come here.

816
00:39:57,209 --> 00:39:58,292
How you doin'?

817
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:00,001
- Good.
- Yeah?

818
00:40:00,084 --> 00:40:01,208
Remember when you
were a little girl

819
00:40:01,209 --> 00:40:02,375
what I used to call you?

820
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:03,833
What do you mean
you don't remember?

821
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,250
You were too young to remember?

822
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:07,625
- Don't!
- No!

823
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:10,709
How come you don't remember?

824
00:40:10,792 --> 00:40:12,917
Remember what I used
to call you, huh?

825
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:15,168
- Ooh.
- Hey, ow!

826
00:40:30,209 --> 00:40:32,084
You know Hugh built this house?

827
00:40:32,168 --> 00:40:35,917
Your friend's maxin' out the
situation down there at Puss's.

828
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:37,917
Sure.

829
00:40:38,001 --> 00:40:40,375
Factory seat. Two k.

830
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:42,325
I tried.

831
00:40:42,709 --> 00:40:45,542
Well, I'd hate to see Ang'
get stuck with that.

832
00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:49,834
Then again, her friend
over there is takin' me

833
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:52,876
to the cleaners
with this divorce shit.

834
00:40:52,959 --> 00:40:54,625
I gotta belt-tighten.

835
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,667
Can we get some able-bodied
seamen over here?

836
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,459
Tony B.?

837
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,876
What, am I a fuckin' slave?

838
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:12,001
Ho!

839
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,168
I didn't have a drop.

840
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,917
God damn it.

841
00:41:17,001 --> 00:41:19,126
Lester'll drive;
he's in the bathroom.

842
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:21,625
Watch your head.

843
00:41:21,709 --> 00:41:25,209
Hey! Virginia Mayo.

844
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:40,542
Thank you for coming.

845
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:43,834
I'm sorry for everything,
what can I say?

846
00:41:43,917 --> 00:41:45,792
Get my boy home safe.

847
00:41:49,168 --> 00:41:50,292
You're sorry for what?

848
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:52,834
- Aw...
- No-no I wanna hear.

849
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:54,375
Oh, please, Carmela.

850
00:41:54,459 --> 00:41:57,792
The off-color jokes,
the sausage twirling...

851
00:41:57,876 --> 00:41:59,500
Tony.

852
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:02,292
These are cultured Italians.

853
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:04,375
Russ is a success, a diplomat.

854
00:42:04,459 --> 00:42:05,834
This was a shock for them.

855
00:42:05,917 --> 00:42:08,375
And he's such a diplomat
he insults his host?

856
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:09,750
You heard what he said to Tony.

857
00:42:09,834 --> 00:42:12,542
He is a pompous man.
He always was.

858
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:14,417
Let's talk about this
another time.

859
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,333
That's why you
didn't want Tony here.

860
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:18,667
Had nothin' to do with
the marital situation.

861
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,292
All along, it was so that
your cultured Italian friends,

862
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:25,709
who were born and raised
on Arthur Avenue I might add,

863
00:42:25,792 --> 00:42:27,709
wouldn't meet your
<i>gavone</i> son-in-law.

864
00:42:27,792 --> 00:42:29,333
He made us all
look like <i>gavones.</i>

865
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:30,917
Whatever we are
I am proud of it,

866
00:42:31,001 --> 00:42:32,375
unlike you obviously.

867
00:42:32,459 --> 00:42:35,001
I have always been
proud of my heritage.

868
00:42:35,084 --> 00:42:36,459
Oh, bullshit.

869
00:42:36,542 --> 00:42:37,958
I remember you telling
aunt rose you were glad

870
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:39,542
DeAngelis didn't end in a vowel.

871
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:41,250
I never said that!

872
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:44,667
And when Meadow came out,
"Oh my God, she's so dark".

873
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,333
You're drunk. I'm going home.

874
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:48,000
You know, there are
Italians all around

875
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:49,792
with their closet self-loathing.

876
00:42:49,876 --> 00:42:52,168
I just never wanted to believe
my mother was one of 'em.

877
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,834
And now what the fuck
are you crying about?

878
00:42:55,917 --> 00:42:57,834
You're secret is out.

879
00:42:59,792 --> 00:43:00,834
Marco.

880
00:43:00,917 --> 00:43:03,333
Polo.

881
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:04,500
Marco.

882
00:43:04,584 --> 00:43:06,001
Polo.

883
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,001
Marco?

884
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,375
Polo.

885
00:43:10,459 --> 00:43:13,084
Marco. Polo.

886
00:43:15,834 --> 00:43:17,667
Fish outta water!
You're it, Ton'!

887
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,667
Takin' a T-O.

888
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:22,917
Marco. Polo.

889
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:24,792
Here let me-- let me get this.

890
00:43:24,876 --> 00:43:26,584
No, I'm fine. You have fun.

891
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:28,084
No, no, really. Let me...

892
00:43:28,168 --> 00:43:31,542
Forget it, I'll get it.

893
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:32,917
Tony, put me down!

894
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:34,291
You look like
you could use a dip!

895
00:43:34,292 --> 00:43:35,584
No, don't you, I'm serious!

896
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:37,209
One.

897
00:43:37,292 --> 00:43:39,042
- Two.
- Tony, don't!

898
00:43:39,126 --> 00:43:40,209
Three!

899
00:43:43,917 --> 00:43:48,042
- You bastards!
- You're it, Carm.

900
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,709
Whoo!

901
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:55,126
Idiots.

902
00:43:55,209 --> 00:43:57,959
Hey, don't let her get out.

903
00:43:58,042 --> 00:43:59,500
You--no!

904
00:44:01,042 --> 00:44:02,584
Ho!

905
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:04,242
You're still it!

906
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:07,126
Marco.

907
00:44:07,209 --> 00:44:09,584
Polo.

908
00:44:09,667 --> 00:44:11,584
All right.

909
00:44:11,667 --> 00:44:12,876
Pleasant dreams, hammers.

910
00:44:12,959 --> 00:44:13,876
Night, Dad.

911
00:44:13,959 --> 00:44:15,084
Good night, Grandma.

912
00:44:15,168 --> 00:44:16,750
Good night.

913
00:44:16,834 --> 00:44:18,084
Your grandma's not a maid.

914
00:44:18,168 --> 00:44:20,917
I'll put 'em in the hamper.

915
00:44:21,001 --> 00:44:23,250
- What's this?
- I don't know.

916
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:25,292
- Yes, you do.
- Shut up.

917
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:27,042
Am I talkin' to you, Justin?

918
00:44:30,792 --> 00:44:35,459
I asked you a question, Jason.

919
00:44:35,542 --> 00:44:37,001
Pins.

920
00:44:37,084 --> 00:44:41,625
From the '96 Olympics
in Atlanta it looks like.

921
00:44:43,459 --> 00:44:46,333
That's when you were
stationed in Saudi Arabia,

922
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:48,126
right, Dad?

923
00:44:48,209 --> 00:44:49,375
Yes, that's right.

924
00:44:49,459 --> 00:44:51,709
But I'm talkin' to your brother.

925
00:44:51,792 --> 00:44:53,584
You took this tonight,
didn't you?

926
00:44:53,667 --> 00:44:56,126
I borrowed it from AJ.

927
00:44:56,209 --> 00:44:57,374
You stole this from your cousin

928
00:44:57,375 --> 00:44:58,876
who opens his house to you?

929
00:44:58,959 --> 00:45:02,001
I found it on the floor
way in back of AJ's closet.

930
00:45:02,084 --> 00:45:03,750
He doesn't care.

931
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:05,333
With all the stuff he has?

932
00:45:05,417 --> 00:45:07,792
He got to go to the Olympics
and everything.

933
00:45:07,876 --> 00:45:09,375
I love where he lives.

934
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:11,209
I don't wanna come back here.

935
00:45:17,834 --> 00:45:22,042
My son steals
from his own family.

936
00:45:22,126 --> 00:45:25,375
You're gonna return it
tomorrow and apologize.

937
00:45:25,459 --> 00:45:28,126
Where are your Gameboys?

938
00:45:28,209 --> 00:45:29,209
That's mine.

939
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,250
Jason's is in the drawer.

940
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,670
I'm givin' both of these
to the Salvation Army.

941
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,417
I didn't do nothing!

942
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,209
You're just as bad as he is
'cause you didn't stop him!

943
00:45:46,876 --> 00:45:48,168
We should get going, AJ.

944
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,916
I don't wanna drop you off
at Patrick's too late.

945
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:51,834
Call me when you
get to Patrick's.

946
00:45:51,917 --> 00:45:53,126
Yeah, I'll try.

947
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,959
He's in a bad cell area.

948
00:45:59,292 --> 00:46:00,959
He'll try?

949
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:04,333
Just showin' her he's not a kid.

950
00:46:04,417 --> 00:46:05,667
Mm...

951
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,517
I think he's showin' her
more than that.

952
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,209
Well, that's inevitable.

953
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:13,250
It's scary is what that is.

954
00:46:13,333 --> 00:46:15,584
He'll be fine.

955
00:46:15,667 --> 00:46:17,375
He's in love.

956
00:46:17,459 --> 00:46:18,542
Oh, please.

957
00:46:23,042 --> 00:46:25,084
You know what
it's like at that age.

958
00:46:25,168 --> 00:46:26,959
Hmm?

959
00:46:28,584 --> 00:46:31,168
Can't wait to see each other.

960
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,625
Can't keep your
hands off each other.

961
00:46:36,542 --> 00:46:38,792
Tony, what are you doing?

962
00:46:40,375 --> 00:46:42,292
What am I doin'?

963
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:44,417
Tony, let's call it a night.

964
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,542
Why?

965
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:50,750
- You tired?
- Yes.

966
00:46:50,834 --> 00:46:52,084
Come on.

967
00:46:52,168 --> 00:46:55,250
Artie is right over there.

968
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:57,250
He's comatose.

969
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:12,042
Tony...

970
00:47:12,126 --> 00:47:13,842
This is nice, no?

971
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:17,675
Tony...

972
00:47:19,459 --> 00:47:21,917
Doesn't it feel nice?

973
00:47:22,001 --> 00:47:23,750
I didn't say that.

974
00:47:35,792 --> 00:47:36,792
No, Tony, don't.

975
00:47:36,876 --> 00:47:38,709
Shh...

976
00:48:25,792 --> 00:48:28,417
<i>So which type of,
uh, torture instrument</i>

977
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,417
<i>we going to use?</i>

978
00:48:37,667 --> 00:48:39,750
<i>That will wake up the neighbors
you know.</i>

979
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:40,900
<i>Yeah.</i>

980
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:43,567
<i>You have to go where you
have like a two-by-four...</i>

981
00:48:50,168 --> 00:48:51,625
Hello?

982
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:56,417
Blundetto.

983
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,609
How can I help you?

984
00:48:59,292 --> 00:49:00,834
I'm in.

985
00:49:08,709 --> 00:49:10,084
You asleep?

986
00:49:35,876 --> 00:49:37,459
Here you go, Joey.

987
00:49:37,542 --> 00:49:39,792
It's bigger than last week's.

988
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:41,209
Hey, Crystal.

989
00:49:41,292 --> 00:49:42,625
The room is empty.

990
00:49:42,709 --> 00:49:43,876
Come on, time is money.

991
00:49:43,959 --> 00:49:45,917
Thanks. Phil'll be very happy.

992
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:48,292
Yeah. Send him and John
my best, huh?

993
00:49:48,375 --> 00:49:49,417
Good night, Heather.

994
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,042
Good night, Muz.

995
00:49:51,126 --> 00:49:54,417
- You're off?
- Yeah.

996
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,001
I'm goin' downtown.

997
00:49:56,084 --> 00:49:57,417
Me too.

998
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,375
