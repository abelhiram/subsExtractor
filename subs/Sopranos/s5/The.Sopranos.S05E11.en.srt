33
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:22,750
Just saying,
don't trouble yourself.

00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:29,292
How about some Egg Beaters
and Tabasco?

35
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,918
That's fine.

36
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,251
Didn't I tell you I hate this
shouting-between-rooms shit?

37
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:39,834
So you even gonna
look at the brochure?

38
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:44,959
What is it,
Sneakers or something?

39
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:46,875
Sandals.

40
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,625
It's the jewel of Antigua.

41
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,292
Three sun-filled days
on white sand.

42
00:02:53,376 --> 00:02:55,251
I got A.J. on weekends.

43
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:56,750
So we'll go on Monday.

44
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:59,292
Get a great rate
on an ocean view.

45
00:02:59,376 --> 00:03:02,750
The air is the same
temperature as your body,

46
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:04,583
so you don't even
need to wear clothes.

47
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,625
I gotta watch my skin
in the sun.

48
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:08,167
You know, you're
getting a divorce,

49
00:03:08,251 --> 00:03:10,709
and I see you less than before.

50
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:12,709
I didn't say no.

51
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:15,167
I want your
undivided attention, for once.

52
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:18,750
Is it so much to fucking ask
for a little bit of atten...

53
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,334
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit!

54
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:28,459
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

55
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,917
I got you. All right, okay.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,418
All right. I got it.

57
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,126
It's out! It's out!

58
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:34,583
I got it.

59
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:37,376
You're okay. You're okay.

60
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:41,334
There he is.

61
00:03:41,418 --> 00:03:43,542
Hey, kid, it's good to see you.

62
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,559
So you finally made
the trip out here, huh?

63
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:49,209
Tony, this is my oldest,
Charlie.

64
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:50,792
Nice to meet you.

65
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:56,084
Walk with me.

66
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:09,000
Well?

67
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:10,625
You in that suit.

68
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,750
Long way, huh?

69
00:04:14,251 --> 00:04:16,500
He lucked out.
Got his mother's looks.

70
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,667
Takes after her too.

71
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,500
He's in architectural salvage.

72
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,834
Old fixtures, windows, toilets.

73
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:25,959
Like Sanford and Son?

74
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:27,667
Didn't I tell you he's quick?

75
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,818
- Good for you, Charlie. <i>Salute</i>.
<i>- Salute</i>.

76
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,126
Oh.

77
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:35,376
And this is some more,

78
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:36,667
for the Joey Peeps thing.

79
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,292
Not all of it.

80
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,792
Ah, he's okay.

81
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,667
Jesus, I did a clean job.

82
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,126
Fuck it, it's embarrassing.

83
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:47,126
But that's the way
Little Carmine and Rusty

84
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:49,042
are doing things over there now.

85
00:04:49,126 --> 00:04:53,292
I'm sorry, but Rusty, I think he
bangs his wife in installments.

86
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,084
This guy was my old man,

87
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:01,084
my rabbi and my priest
rolled into one.

88
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,958
And even though I don't miss
a fucking day of it,

89
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,834
the parts with this fireplug
were the best.

90
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:07,209
Get the fuck outta here.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,209
Oh, I almost forgot.

92
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:21,542
It spoke to me on account
of your sense of humor and all.

93
00:05:23,376 --> 00:05:25,834
I'm putting this
in a position of prominence.

94
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,875
Hey, how you doing?

95
00:05:56,126 --> 00:06:00,167
Are you gonna operate on me?

96
00:06:00,251 --> 00:06:02,625
No, it's-it's me, Tony.

97
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:05,792
They gotta fight infection.

98
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,959
My hair.

99
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:10,459
Well, the good news is
it'll grow back.

100
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:11,822
And the burns are second degree,

101
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,209
so you don't need a skin graft

102
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:15,500
or that hyperbolic chamber.

103
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,667
You're gonna look the same
as you always did.

104
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,834
Fuck you.

105
00:06:22,084 --> 00:06:23,750
All right, one second.

106
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:24,959
All right.

107
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:27,792
- It hurts.
- Okay, sit tight, rest.

108
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,375
They gotta keep you
in here a couple days

109
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:31,583
so we don't get
no bacteria in there.

110
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:34,750
Are you gonna operate on me?

111
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:37,651
All right, look, I'm gonna
take care of everything.

112
00:06:37,734 --> 00:06:41,450
The doctor bills, a wig.

113
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,459
Whatever.

114
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:46,000
And don't worry about nothing.

115
00:06:46,084 --> 00:06:47,292
- Okay?
- Okay.

116
00:06:47,376 --> 00:06:48,583
Okay.

117
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:50,834
I gotta go.

118
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:52,126
Oh.

119
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:04,292
Just put it in there.

120
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:12,251
I'm going to get some twine.

121
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:14,792
Forget it,
I'm not going that far.

00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,750
Ange, sorry about that.

134
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:58,000
We were on our way to your
place, and Billy sees you drive by.

135
00:07:58,084 --> 00:08:00,125
I tried to get your attention
for a couple of blocks.

136
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:01,709
Why didn't you use
a fucking phone?

137

I'm an old man.
I don't see so good in the dark.

138
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:06,000
Jesus, relax.

139
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:07,625
Johnny wants to see you.

140
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:10,000
This late?
Tell him I'll see him tomorrow.

141
00:08:10,084 --> 00:08:11,334
Apparently it's gotta be now.

142
00:08:11,418 --> 00:08:13,084
You know,
he's in one of his moods.

143
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:18,251
Fine.

144
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:19,667
I'll follow you over.

145
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,167
Whatever, let's go.

146
00:08:35,126 --> 00:08:36,500
Don't!

147
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,084
Hey! Jesus, don't!

148
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:47,376
Phil, please!

149
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,542
Philly! Philly, you know me.

150
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,376
You couldn't fucking retire?

151
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:53,292
Philly, for God's sake,
you know me!

152
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:01,625
Look at this shit.

153
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,042
You know the work I just had?

154
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,126
Give me the fucking keys.

155
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,959
Mirsa, you seen today's paper?

156
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:21,000
Everything in the kitchen,
Mr. Tony!

157
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:37,251
God-fucking-damn it.

158
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,917
You know this is today's paper?

159
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,667
Oh, no.

160
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,042
This is today's paper, Mirsa.

161
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:48,292
That's I'm thinking.

162
00:09:48,376 --> 00:09:50,209
Why'd you throw it away?

163
00:09:50,292 --> 00:09:51,542
Oh, no.

164
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,000
Jesus Christ, forget it.

165
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:57,517
I bake you some
enchiladas you like.

166
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,792
Thank you. That's nice of you.

167
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:22,542
These are for you. Enchiladas.

168
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,834
Okay.

169
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,625
I came for my money.

170
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:32,083
Don't worry, I'll talk
to Carlo and tell him why

171
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:35,042
you're kicking up
directly to me this week.

172
00:10:35,126 --> 00:10:36,375
I gotta be careful
getting my cash,

173
00:10:36,376 --> 00:10:38,792
on account of
the Carmela situation.

174
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,542
She's all over that.

175
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:44,376
- You buying that WaveRunner?
- Oh, I'm, uh, moving to the Plaza.

176
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:47,167
That fucking house
is falling down around my ears.

177
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:50,126
Well, we did good over
at the casino last night.

178
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:51,459
I seriously dread going home.

179
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:53,042
That fucking Guatemalan,

180
00:10:53,126 --> 00:10:55,250
she forgets her English
whenever it suits her purposes,

181
00:10:55,251 --> 00:10:57,251
and then she shows up
whenever she feels like

182
00:10:57,334 --> 00:10:59,167
with the fucking enchiladas.

183
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:01,334
So fire her ass, get a new one.

184
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,126
This is the new one.

185
00:11:11,376 --> 00:11:15,292
I been in the burn ward a
couple of nights with Valentina.

186
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:17,376
Poor thing caught
herself on fire.

187
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:21,667
No shit?

188
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,500
She's laying there
like a rag doll,

189
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,251
the poor kid.

190
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:29,625
That smell.
Fuck, that burning hair smell.

191
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:32,376
I can still smell it.

192
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:35,939
Jesus, you know,
that's the last thing

193
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:38,376
that Carmine said
before he had his stroke?

194
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,500
He smelled burning hair.

195
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:47,334
You got a Coke or something?

196
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,834
Ma, can you get Tony a Coke?

197
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:52,876
<i>I'm upstairs!</i>

198
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:55,667
Jason, Justin, get up here!

199
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:00,583
You all right?

200
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,500
I just got the kids up my ass,
that's all.

201
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,959
So you come
across any burn victims

202
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:11,334
at that hospital in the can?

203
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:15,218
Sure, Aryan guys are always
setting each other on fire.

204
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,042
So, what's she in for?

205
00:12:17,126 --> 00:12:19,376
You know, the future, I mean.

206
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:22,042
They said she don't need
no skin grafts.

207
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:26,359
Seriously, what the fuck
is with you?

208
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:28,583
I just told you.

209
00:12:33,376 --> 00:12:34,709
You know the tough part is,

210
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:37,959
this girl is a constant
pain in my ass.

211
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:40,418
I was gonna end it
right there, that night.

212
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,167
And now how the fuck
is it gonna look?

213
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:44,959
That is a tough one.

214
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:48,959
How the fuck does this shit
always happen to me?

215
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:56,583
You know what I been
thinking about lately?

216
00:12:57,025 --> 00:12:58,734
Charmaine Bucco.

217
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,251
Nice set on her.

218
00:13:01,334 --> 00:13:03,376
No, not like that.

219
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:06,583
Well, maybe like that.

220
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:10,792
But also,
she's a fantastic cook.

221
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,418
She's better than Artie
in some ways.

222
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,709
Plus, she's a licensed
notary public.

223
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:19,209
I mean, I'm thinking that this
is the kind of woman I need.

224
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:23,084
And it almost worked
between me and her, right?

225
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:30,667
Comic books, juice boxes,
robot crap all over the place.

226
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,417
Go get your uncle a Coke
and then your stuff.

227
00:13:32,418 --> 00:13:34,418
I'm taking you back
to your mom's early.

228
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:38,967
I should take off.

229
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,917
Yeah, you know, I really gotta
run them over there now.

230
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,167
All right, yeah.

231
00:13:43,251 --> 00:13:44,376
I'll see you later.

232
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:45,709
All right.

233
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,767
I'll come over to the hotel.

234
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:50,259
Yeah.

235
00:14:06,334 --> 00:14:07,542
Lawrence wedding?

236
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,000
- No.
- Long-term or short-term?

237
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:11,667
Can't you just park it?

238
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,042
Here.

239
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:26,834
Keep it out of the horse shit
over there, will you?

240
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,500
Oh, yeah. Beautiful, ladies.
Here we go.

241
00:14:42,242 --> 00:14:43,626
Although you'll be paying cash,

242
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:46,358
we'll need to see a credit card
to secure any incidental charges.

243
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:48,084
Minibar, parking, et cetera.

244
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:49,376
Right.

245
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:53,792
- Here.
- Thank you.

246
00:14:57,251 --> 00:14:59,251
Oh, Jill, that's so funny.

247
00:14:59,334 --> 00:15:01,750
Very good, Mr. Petraglia.

248
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:06,042
We have you in a deluxe suite
with a park view.

249
00:15:06,126 --> 00:15:07,459
My name is Sharice.

250
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:09,317
And along with our 24-hour
concierge service,

251
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,067
I'm here to see that you enjoy
your stay with us.

252
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:13,542
Great.

253
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,583
The bellman will show you
to your room.

254
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:17,959
Enjoy your stay, Mr. Petraglia.

255
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:28,625
Anything else I can do,
press nine, ask for Jesus.

256
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:32,500
For you.

257
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,917
Thank you, sir. Enjoy your stay.

258
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,583
Thanks.

259
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:30,667

00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:02,084
Hello?

280
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:04,042
- Who's this?
- It's Dot. Who's this?

281
00:19:04,126 --> 00:19:05,709
It's Tony, looking for Ton'.

282
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:07,167
Oh, he's not here.

283
00:19:07,251 --> 00:19:08,834
He didn't come in
tonight at all.

284
00:19:08,917 --> 00:19:10,167
He might be in later, though.

285
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:12,167
You wanna try
his portable phone?

286
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,583
I did.

287
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:16,667
You see him, you have him
call me, immediately.

288
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,292
Okay, will do.

289
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,583
Hello?

290
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:37,959
Yeah, Aunt Quin.

291
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:39,583
It's Tony, looking for Ton'.

292
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:42,459
Marone, I was hoping
he was with you.

293
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:43,834
You heard from him?

294
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:46,917
Not since he took the kids back
this morning.

295
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,583
Call me if you hear,
you understand?

296
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,209
- Yeah.
- You got my cell?

297
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:51,376
Yeah.

298
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:52,583
What's wrong?

299
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,667
Yeah?

300
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,042
- You seen my cousin?
- No.

301
00:20:02,126 --> 00:20:04,292
But I heard about
that thing last night.

302
00:20:04,376 --> 00:20:06,875
The old-timer
was a stand-up guy.

303
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:08,376
Yeah, well,
that's the least of it.

304
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,542
Hold on. Hold on.

305
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:19,126
Hey, you call for a date?

306
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:20,542
Yeah. Yeah.

307
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,000
Got company?

308
00:20:22,084 --> 00:20:23,334
Yeah.

309
00:20:23,418 --> 00:20:25,625
- Hold on a second.
- Can I get a drink?

310
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:27,126
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

311
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:32,292
I wanna know the minute
he surfaces.

312
00:20:32,376 --> 00:20:33,667
You got it.

313
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,916
I saw him this morning, and he
must have known something,

314
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:37,459
because he was acting
all squirrelly.

315
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:39,209
He's got a right to be upset

316
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:41,500
after what him and Ange
been through together.

317
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,917
They were cell mates
at Allenwood.

318
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,084
I don't know, I got
a bad feeling about this.

319
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:47,084
Don't worry about it.

320
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:48,583
He ain't that stupid.

321
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,292
Yeah, you're probably right.

322
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,917
We'll let you know
if we see him.

323
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:07,126
You want me to suck
your dick now, baby?

324
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,459
Is that what you want, baby?

325
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:23,459
What the fuck?

326
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,717
Tony, I'm so lonely.

327
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:32,126
I miss my Violet.

328
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:33,959
What violin?

329
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,750
Violet, my wife.

330
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:38,334
She was everything to me.

331
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:42,459
I'm all alone on the other side.

332
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:44,167
It ain't right.

333
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:54,984
Answer the fucking thing.

334
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:02,667
If it's him,
tell him you ain't seen me.

335
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,500
Tell who?

336
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,418
The Man Upstairs.

337
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:16,084
Hello?

338
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:18,292
<i>We need you to do somethin'.</i>

339
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,084
Like what?

340
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:27,750
<i>Our friend.</i>

341
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:29,167
<i>He's gotta go.</i>

342
00:22:31,251 --> 00:22:33,126
No problem.

343
00:22:33,209 --> 00:22:34,875
<i>Don't fuck it up.
It's important.</i>

344
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:36,667
I know it's important.

345
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,834
He was staring straight at me.

346
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:49,917
And he didn't look dead.

347
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,750
Any deader than he ever did,
anyways.

348
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,459
And he says, uh,

349
00:22:59,542 --> 00:23:02,251
"I miss my wife."

350
00:23:02,334 --> 00:23:05,042
Then the phone rings, and...

351
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:08,084
there was this voice.

352
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:11,959
They wanted me to do something.

353
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:13,459
What?

354
00:23:16,376 --> 00:23:18,583
They wanted me to kill a guy.

355
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:20,875
It was just a dream, all right?

356
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:27,126
He must be in heaven.
He said "the other side."

357
00:23:27,209 --> 00:23:29,251
But he was so fucking sad.

358
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,084
Doesn't sound like heaven to me.

359
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:35,917
Well, you would know
more about it than I do.

360
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:42,167
What'd you see in me, anyways?

361
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:45,084
The object is to learn
what you saw in me,

362
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:46,750
not what I saw in you.

363
00:23:46,834 --> 00:23:50,251
One of these days, Alice.
One of these days.

364
00:23:50,334 --> 00:23:52,500
Pow! Right in the kisser?

365
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,042
"To the moon, Alice!"

366
00:23:54,126 --> 00:23:58,000
I remember when you hit me.
It was like, "Pow! To the moon."

367
00:23:58,084 --> 00:23:59,834
"Don't get me steamed, Alice!"

368
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:01,834
And then you choked
the shit out of me!

369
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:05,376
Yeah, but that's after you were
tryin' to put a fork in my eye.

370
00:24:05,459 --> 00:24:07,583
No! That was your mother!

371
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:19,292
Sometimes what happens here
is like taking a shit.

372
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:22,418
I prefer to think of it
as more like childbirth.

373
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:25,259
Maybe it is more
like childbirth.

374
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:27,418
You tell me.

375
00:24:29,084 --> 00:24:31,792
I don't have any children.

376
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:35,625
I died too young.

377
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,625
My cousin does a mean Gleason.

378
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:57,209
Are you ready for what
you have to do?

379
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:58,667
No sweat.

380
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,334
I did my homework.

381
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:26,917
You wanna ride up front?

382
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
No, Dad, I'm fine.

383
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:32,583
Kid gets sick in the back seat.

384
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:43,026
You know, douchebag, I
realize I'm dreaming.

385
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:47,292
I got no opinion,
one way or the other.

386
00:25:48,792 --> 00:25:50,418
Anybody mind?

387
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:55,583
What?

388
00:25:59,376 --> 00:26:01,542
Where we goin'?

389
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:05,942
Driving you to the job.

390
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,875
Oh, Jesus, you scared me.

391
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,875
And you're not even ready.

392
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,709
We gotta meet Finn's parents.

393
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:37,500
Why didn't you wake me up?

394
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:39,084
Is that how you're gonna dress?

395
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:41,376
Well, my stuff isn't here.

396
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:43,583
You left your brown suit.

397
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,376
I did?

398
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:49,251
And we're late.

399
00:26:49,334 --> 00:26:50,967
I had the worst fucking dream.

400
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,659
Tony, we're late.

401
00:26:52,742 --> 00:26:54,334
And we should take
separate cars.

402
00:26:54,418 --> 00:26:55,917
Oh, yeah.

403
00:26:57,334 --> 00:26:58,959
<i>Howdy.</i>

404
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:01,376
<i>You, uh, were riding out here</i>

405
00:27:01,459 --> 00:27:02,917
<i>the other day, weren't you?</i>

406
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,875
<i>You speak English?</i>

407
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,500
<i>¿Habla inglés?</i>

408
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:08,834
<i>Sí.</i>

409
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:12,542
- Tony...
- What? Give me a minute.

410
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,709
Can you pull yourself away for once?

411
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:16,459
Your head is filled
with this stuff.

412
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:21,500
It's just that it's so much
more interesting.

413
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:23,000
Than what?

414
00:27:23,084 --> 00:27:24,234
Than life.

415
00:27:24,317 --> 00:27:26,409
What, are you kidding me?
It is your life.

416
00:27:31,126 --> 00:27:32,667
<i>Good morning, señor.</i>

417
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:36,376
<i>Tell me, what day is it?</i>

418
00:27:36,459 --> 00:27:37,875
<i>What day?</i>

419
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:39,542
<i>Why, it's Christmas Day,
of course, sir.</i>

420
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,000
<i>Christmas Day! Christmas Day!</i>

421
00:27:41,084 --> 00:27:43,042
<i>Christmas Day.
Then I haven't missed it.</i>

422
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,959
<i>The spirits must've done
everything in one night.</i>

423
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:50,084
Will you please get dressed?

424
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:51,583
<i>Of course they can.</i>

425
00:28:05,418 --> 00:28:06,792
<i>God, look at you.</i>

426
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:10,709
<i>All right, let's go.</i>

427
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:16,667
I'll wait in the car.

428
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:22,167
<i>I'll wait in the car.</i>

429
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:26,959
<i>Now what's the matter?</i>

430
00:28:27,042 --> 00:28:28,459
<i>Nothing.</i>

431
00:28:35,209 --> 00:28:36,667
Are you coming?

432
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,959
Yeah.

433
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:41,709
Hi.

434
00:28:41,792 --> 00:28:43,334
How are you both?

435
00:29:01,251 --> 00:29:04,000
There you are.
I was getting so nervous.

436
00:29:04,084 --> 00:29:05,418
Hiya, babe.

437
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,959
We were about to start
calling the hospitals.

438
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:09,917
Somebody forgot.

439
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,542
I'd like you to meet
Finn's parents.

440
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,418
Mr. DeTrolio and Mrs. DeTrolio.

441
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:15,251
Oh, how do you do?

442
00:29:15,334 --> 00:29:17,459
- Hi, how are you?
- Nice to meet you.

443
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:23,667
We've been enjoying getting to know
your daughter while we were waiting.

444
00:29:28,418 --> 00:29:30,209
So how's the food here?

445
00:29:30,292 --> 00:29:31,509
It's pretty goodl, uh,

446
00:29:31,592 --> 00:29:34,067
we went to high school
with the owner and his wife.

447
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:37,351
Oh, you two were
high school sweethearts?

448
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:45,542
So how long can you stay?

449
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:47,667
Something I have
to take care of.

450
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,792
Oh.

451
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:51,292
Show them what you have
in your pocket.

452
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:00,242
With a husband in dental school,

453
00:30:00,325 --> 00:30:02,875
he'll be able to fix
your mouth, honey.

454
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:04,292
Then for the capper...

455
00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:12,034
Oh, son of a bitch.

456
00:30:12,418 --> 00:30:16,884
We know all about you,
and I think it's great.

457
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:18,917
Well, that's a relief,
huh, Tony?

458
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:20,333
Speaking of dental school,

459
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:23,126
people always told us Finn would
never amount to much.

460
00:30:23,209 --> 00:30:25,417
He won't.
I think the die is cast.

461
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,876
Yeah, if it wasn't for his Tooth
Fairy money, he'd have nothing.

462
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:31,250
Let's not get into it in front
of other people, okay?

463
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:32,834
Well, you're the one that said--

464
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:35,209
Never mind.
Please, just drop it.

465
00:30:37,876 --> 00:30:39,959
So, Meadow,

466
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:41,209
do you play an instrument?

467
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:43,250
I was in chamber singers.

468
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:44,834

use a nice tinkle.

00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:27,584
I'll go with you.

501
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:29,125
I don't want my husband
coming out of there

502
00:32:29,126 --> 00:32:30,667
with just his cock in his hand.

503
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,876
Mine either. Believe me.

504
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:55,959
Oh, that feels good.

505
00:32:57,417 --> 00:32:59,209
You don't do this no more, huh?

506
00:32:59,292 --> 00:33:00,709
No.

507
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:04,168
Oh.

508
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,750
You got a good boy out there.

509
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:09,250
Are you gonna be able
to come through on the thing?

510
00:33:10,459 --> 00:33:12,333
I did my homework.

511
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:16,625
Yeah?

512
00:33:17,834 --> 00:33:21,001
Well, the piece wasn't
behind the toilet.

513
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:23,500
- Well, this is real life.
- No, it's not.

514
00:33:26,042 --> 00:33:27,250
This is it.

515
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:33,292
Stop! Stop!

516
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:42,667
I knew this was gonna happen.

517
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,126
Why didn't you stop him?

518
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,292
Please.

519
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:13,250
You have any idea
what you just did?

520
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:15,750
Why don't you tell them
what happened 20 years ago.

521
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:18,084
I can't go into that right now.

522
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:24,792
What do I gotta count to
before I can get up?

523
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:26,168
Tony?

524
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,792
You're really dead.

525
00:34:27,876 --> 00:34:31,500
But I got kids. They got kids.

526
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:40,625
Yo, wasn't that Tony there
the guy you were supposed to cap

527
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:42,084
to prevent this from happening?

528
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:44,375
I don't know.

529
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,375
I guess not.

530
00:34:48,542 --> 00:34:50,209
I don't have a piece.

531
00:34:52,917 --> 00:34:54,333
Annette Bening?

532
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:56,917
There's something "Bugsy"
about him.

533
00:35:17,059 --> 00:35:18,476
Get him!

534
00:35:33,584 --> 00:35:34,834
Over here!

535
00:35:48,542 --> 00:35:49,750
I'm wiped out.

536
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:00,834
The fuck you doing
to yourself?

537
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:01,959
Huh?

538
00:36:04,168 --> 00:36:05,500
What's that noise?

539
00:36:05,584 --> 00:36:07,709
It's those micks
outside the hotel

540
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:09,542
with those carriage rides.

541
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,834
Tell them to go away.

542
00:36:10,917 --> 00:36:12,292
Oh, God, Tony.

543
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:14,333
It's so much better
than when we were kids.

544
00:36:14,417 --> 00:36:16,168
See? What'd I tell you?
The best, huh?

545
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,834
Oh, she likes it when
you rub her muzzle.

546
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:30,667
I think I wanna come home.

547
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,792
There are some
non-negotiable conditions.

548
00:36:32,876 --> 00:36:34,001
Like what?

549
00:36:34,084 --> 00:36:35,667
You can't have
your horse in here.

550
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,625
- Why not?
- Are you kidding me?

551
00:36:37,709 --> 00:36:40,126
The smell, and shit
all over the place?

552
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:41,625
I'll clean up after her.

553
00:36:41,709 --> 00:36:43,250
You always say that.

554
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,084
I'll have to think about it.

555
00:36:48,168 --> 00:36:50,250
You're the one brought it up.

556
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,176
I should go.

557
00:36:54,959 --> 00:36:57,359
You didn't take care of that?

558
00:36:58,625 --> 00:36:59,959
But...

559
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:02,750
check this out.

560
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:05,542
Be careful.

561
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,126
I know you're there, Soprano.

562
00:39:05,001 --> 00:39:07,667
Well, come on.
You're gonna do it, do it.

563
00:39:18,542 --> 00:39:19,917
Well, look at you.

564
00:39:20,001 --> 00:39:22,459
How you doing, Coach Molinaro?

565
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:24,126
Me? I'm fine.

566
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:26,126
What's that you got there?

567
00:39:26,209 --> 00:39:28,209
A bigger dingus
than the one God gave you?

568
00:39:30,917 --> 00:39:32,626
Dumbass.

569
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:36,001
You know, you ought to show
some respect.

570
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:37,959
Why?

571
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,292
'Cause I'm not some kid anymore.

572
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:41,750
No?

573
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:47,542
What did I tell you?

574
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:50,316
Cleave yourself away from
them bums you hang with, I said.

575
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:52,667
Well, I'm in therapy now.

576
00:39:54,126 --> 00:39:56,126
That's a damn shame.

577
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:59,667
You all listened to that
pismire, Arthur Bucco.

578
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:02,209
He was the worst of the bunch.
I told you that.

579
00:40:02,292 --> 00:40:04,959
Artie owns a restaurant.
He's doing great.

580
00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:07,417
- Bucco?
- Yeah.

581
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,333
So what? The exception
that proves the rule.

582
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:11,168
Oh, you know everything,
don't you?

583
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,690
I suppose you blame it
on your father

584
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,500
when you're crying
to that shrink of yours.

585
00:40:15,584 --> 00:40:16,876
No, more my mother.

586
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:20,834
Of course, even better.

587
00:40:20,917 --> 00:40:24,209
Well, my family was different
than other kids' families.

588
00:40:24,292 --> 00:40:25,875
You know, I bet you got
that psychologist

589
00:40:25,876 --> 00:40:27,584
wrapped around your finger.

590
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:30,375
Well, that's what you always
told me I was good at, right?

591
00:40:30,459 --> 00:40:33,126
I also told you, most likely,

592
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:35,168
you'd take the easy way out.

593
00:40:38,042 --> 00:40:40,292
It hasn't been easy!

594
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:42,876
I see you on TV.

595
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:44,375
Oh, yeah?

596
00:40:44,459 --> 00:40:46,209
Some show you put on.

597
00:40:47,292 --> 00:40:48,667
The Five O'Clock News.

598
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,667
Then you realize I got nothing
to apologize to you for.

599
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,375
I am a leader.

600
00:40:55,459 --> 00:40:57,917
Got a house worth a million-two.

601
00:40:58,001 --> 00:40:59,834
Two kids. Wife.

602
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:01,042
Do you?

603
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,084
- Do I what?
- Have a wife?

604
00:41:03,168 --> 00:41:06,792
Yeah. She's got the big house
'cause I'm successful.

605
00:41:06,876 --> 00:41:09,459
You and I know
your little secret.

606
00:41:09,542 --> 00:41:11,792
You know, I only told you
I wanted to be a coach

607
00:41:11,876 --> 00:41:14,042
'cause I liked playing ball,
but I was shining you on,

608
00:41:14,126 --> 00:41:15,584
'cause that's
what I do with people.

609
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:17,292
I told you many times, Anthony,

610
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:19,084
you were special.

611
00:41:19,168 --> 00:41:22,625
You had smarts, personality,
leadership potential,

612
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:24,542
all the "perquisites"
to lead young men

613
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:26,042
onto the field of sport.

614
00:41:26,126 --> 00:41:28,250
And now look at the stress
you live with.

615
00:41:38,459 --> 00:41:39,792
You're not prepared!

616
00:41:49,417 --> 00:41:50,750
You'll never shut me up!

617
00:42:34,584 --> 00:42:35,834
Yeah?

618
00:42:35,917 --> 00:42:39,084
<i>We're sorry to disturb you at
this hour, Mr. Petraglia,</i>

619
00:42:39,168 --> 00:42:41,084
<i>but there's a
Mr. Montevani to see you.</i>

620
00:42:41,168 --> 00:42:42,959
<i>He says it's urgent.</i>

621
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:44,292
Send him up.

622
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:24,209
Hey.

623
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,834
Sorry to get you up,

624
00:43:28,917 --> 00:43:30,876
but I knew you'd
wanna know right away.

625
00:43:32,126 --> 00:43:33,250
Know what?

626
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:36,625
Tony B. took out Billy Leotardo.

627
00:43:38,459 --> 00:43:39,667
Yeah.

628
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,001
Wait a minute, you mean Philly?

629
00:43:41,084 --> 00:43:43,250
Billy. Phil got winged.

630
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:45,209
- He's in the hospital.
- Ah.

631
00:43:45,292 --> 00:43:47,084
TB went ape over Angelo.

632
00:43:47,168 --> 00:43:48,667
Phil, he's holding
his little brother

633
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,084
as the kid's dying in his arms.

634
00:43:50,168 --> 00:43:52,792
There's blood all over Phil.

635
00:43:52,876 --> 00:43:54,084
Jesus.

636
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,834
So he knew.

637
00:43:59,292 --> 00:44:00,792
Goddamn him.

638
00:44:02,959 --> 00:44:04,583
He knew what he was gonna do
when he sat there

639
00:44:04,584 --> 00:44:06,500
right in his mother's house
and pretended.

640
00:44:07,709 --> 00:44:09,292
Lied right to my face.

641
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,917
I don't know what to say.

642
00:44:13,001 --> 00:44:15,168
Guess TB's fucked, poor guy.

643
00:44:17,168 --> 00:44:18,917
Poor guy?

644
00:44:19,001 --> 00:44:21,001
We're all fucked.

645
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:26,042
I'm here for you, whatever.

646
00:44:26,126 --> 00:44:27,459
I know that.

647
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,609
It's a nice suite, T.

648
00:44:36,834 --> 00:44:39,750
Anyway, thought you
needed to know right away.

649
00:44:42,709 --> 00:44:45,168
You gonna eat that?

650
00:44:46,876 --> 00:44:48,333
No, take it.

651
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:49,792
Thanks.

652
00:44:49,876 --> 00:44:51,001
All right.

653
00:44:51,084 --> 00:44:52,500
See you later.

654
00:45:55,667 --> 00:45:56,917
<i>Hello?</i>

655
00:45:57,001 --> 00:45:58,126
Yeah, don't get alarmed.

656
00:45:58,209 --> 00:46:00,467
I'm sorry to call you
so early, but, uh,

657
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,417
<i>I gotta cancel
the fishing trip.</i>

658
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,168
<i>Tell A.J.</i>

659
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:05,292
You all right?

660
00:46:05,375 --> 00:46:07,209
Yeah, yeah.

661
00:46:12,667 --> 00:46:15,750
I had one of my
Coach Molinaro dreams.

662
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:19,084
Oh, yeah?

663
00:46:19,168 --> 00:46:21,375
<i>Were you unprepared, as usual?</i>

664
00:46:21,459 --> 00:46:22,917
<i>Yeah.</i>

665
00:46:23,959 --> 00:46:25,250
<i>As usual.</i>

666
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:26,750
Yeah, Mr. Mol.

667
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:29,084
I wonder where he is now.

668
00:46:29,168 --> 00:46:31,042
He wasn't such a bad guy.

669
00:46:31,126 --> 00:46:32,209
A bad guy, no.

670
00:46:32,292 --> 00:46:33,866
He actually took
an interest in you.

671
00:46:33,867 --> 00:46:35,375
<i>A lot of that was bullshit.</i>

672
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:38,333
It was just his way of keeping
me from causing trouble.

673
00:46:38,417 --> 00:46:40,792
Make his life easier.

674
00:46:40,876 --> 00:46:42,333
<i>I don't know about that.</i>

675
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:50,050
I told him in the dream,
I am sort of a coach now.

676
00:46:50,634 --> 00:46:53,668
That's a way of
looking at it, I guess.

677
00:46:59,876 --> 00:47:02,042
Is it daylight where you are?

678
00:47:03,876 --> 00:47:06,001
Nope. Where are you?

679
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:08,001
Looking out at Central Park.

680
00:47:12,001 --> 00:47:13,792
All the lights are on.

681
00:47:18,417 --> 00:47:19,917
You were in the dream too.

682
00:47:20,001 --> 00:47:21,834
Oh, yeah?

683
00:47:21,917 --> 00:47:24,667
<i>I was on this horse.</i>

684
00:47:28,717 --> 00:47:29,660
<i>Anyway, is-</i>

685
00:47:29,684 --> 00:47:30,684
is Artie all right?

686
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,667
'Cause in the dream,
he was the only alive guy

687
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:35,584
in this car full of dead guys.

688
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:38,084
I had dinner over there
last night.

689
00:47:38,168 --> 00:47:40,001
Who'd you eat with?

690
00:47:42,001 --> 00:47:43,959
Gab and Ro.

691
00:47:44,042 --> 00:47:45,667
That's nice.

692
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:46,959
<i>It was all right.</i>

693
00:47:47,042 --> 00:47:48,417
<i>The veal was very dry.</i>

694
00:47:52,625 --> 00:47:55,292
<i>Is that Esterhaz
next door barking?</i>

695
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:56,959
<i>Can you hear him?</i>

696
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:59,001
Absolutely.

697
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,876
5:30 in the morning.

698
00:48:02,584 --> 00:48:06,459
Someone ought to serve him
some veal... à la strychnine.

699
00:48:07,834 --> 00:48:08,917
Stop it.

700
00:48:09,001 --> 00:48:10,876
I'm serious.

701
00:48:10,959 --> 00:48:12,834
