Walter, hey, you looking for me?

32
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:50,292
Yeah, the Crazy Horse.
That's you, right?

33
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:51,792
Yeah, you got something?

34
00:01:51,876 --> 00:01:53,792
Yeah, pole camera,
three days ago.

35
00:01:57,876 --> 00:01:59,876
She locks up the club
for the night.

36
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:05,292
She's throwing away the garbage.

37
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,834
Yeah?

38
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,917
But then she changes her mind.

39
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,709
<i>Finis.</i>

40
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:30,209
Interesting.

41
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:32,168
The good news is, no polyps.

42
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,417
The bad news is, as you can see,

43
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,917
you've got a fairly severe case
of ulcerative colitis.

44
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:39,209
- Jesus Christ.
- She was getting better.

45
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,500
Then last week,
another flare-up.

46
00:02:44,084 --> 00:02:46,459
How are you doing
with the Prozac? Is it helping?

47
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:47,667
She can't even sleep.

48
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,250
- Ma.
- Well, look at her.

49
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,250
I'd like to start you
on a regime of Prednisone.

50
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,500
It's a steroid.

51
00:02:52,584 --> 00:02:54,168
Like for weightlifters?

52
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,834
I've had great success with it
treating this type of condition.

53
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:58,375
I do need to warn you, however,

54
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:00,168
there are certain side effects.

55
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,625
Now mind you,
these are temporary,

56
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:03,333
but there's a good chance
of weight gain,

57
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,168
accompanied by
Cushing's Syndrome.

58
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,959
That's a swelling
of the facial features,

59
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:08,834
a sort of a moon face.

60
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:10,009
What?

61
00:03:10,092 --> 00:03:11,791
You've seen Jerry Lewis
in the last year or two.

62
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,598
- Oh my god.
- She's planning a wedding,

63
00:03:13,622 --> 00:03:15,375
for Christ's sake!

64
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,625
It was fine one day,

65
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:19,417
then suddenly I get
audio and no picture.

66
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,792
Somebody been
fooling around with this?

67
00:03:21,876 --> 00:03:23,168
A.J. had his friends over.

68
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,459
Huh. How'd he do over there
with your dad?

69
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:27,917
- You know, raking the driveway?
- Fine.

70
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:29,361
Except my mother
kept hounding him,

71
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,333
asking him if we were
getting back together.

72
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:36,084
You know, I had a dream
I moved back in here.

73
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,050
You know, just for the record...

74
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,209
I realize what I did was wrong.

75
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:49,084
My...

76
00:03:49,168 --> 00:03:51,709
activities while I lived here.

77
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:54,375
Knowing you were wrong
isn't the half of it, Tony.

78
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:55,667
Oh, really?

79
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,992
What's the other half?

80
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:59,834
Well, suppose something
did happen. Where, theoretically,

81
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:01,667
we did get back together.

82
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,750
Any marriage
would need fidelity.

83
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:06,667
Like Popeye says,
"I yam what I yam."

84
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,417
Well, I didn't marry a cartoon.

85
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,292
Well, it wouldn't be a cartoon.

86
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,168
You had your own
indiscretions yourself.

87
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:19,250
The thing with Furio?

88
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,834
I did not sleep with him, Tony.

89
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:24,917
I'm just saying that, you know,
we're all human, that's all.

90
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:33,375
You know, the truth is,
I got myself where I am.

91
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:36,733
But your open indiscretion,
your total disregard...

92
00:04:37,017 --> 00:04:39,168
You're right, it was--
it was horrible.

93
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,834
To have a knot in your stomach
every time the phone rings.

94
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:43,709
Like you were saying, you know.

95
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:46,750
Theoretically, though,
if we do reconcile,

96
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:49,109
that stuff will never
happen again.

97
00:05:06,276 --> 00:05:07,659
Come on, you gonna go or what?

98
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:09,750
I'm coming.
I was finishing my drink.

99
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:11,267
Fuck!

100
00:05:28,876 --> 00:05:30,333
You can't stay holed up here.

101
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:32,209
That's not healthy, Carmine.

102
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:34,250
How'd it get to this?

103
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,500
Retaliation, counterattacks.

104
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:40,001
We're at a fucking "stagmire."

105
00:05:40,084 --> 00:05:43,459
We back down now, bunker down,

106
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:46,542
what kind of a message
does that send?

107
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,500
Not just to Johnny's people,
either.

108
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:50,333
Billy Leotardo.

109
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,834
What the hell was that?

110
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:55,001
This Blundetto asshole
went off the reservation.

111
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,834
All due respect, Carmine,

112
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:02,584
that's why you need
to get out there,

113
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:04,126
put your ear to the street,

114
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:06,284
let the guys see you
take the reins.

115
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:09,367
That's not how
I wanna handle it.

116
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:25,584
Hey, don't get me wrong.
I always liked your cousin.

117
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:29,333
But whacking Phil's brother
was a major poke in the ass.

118
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:32,209
You know, my cousin almost cried

119
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,259
when I put him in charge
of the casino?

120
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:36,709
After all I did
for that blue-eyed prick,

121
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:38,250
then he completely
fucks me over.

122
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,292
Now I practically gotta get
down on my knees to Johnny Sack.

123
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,500
Where the fuck you been?
You're late.

124
00:06:47,584 --> 00:06:49,500
Highway was jammed
with broken heroes

125
00:06:49,584 --> 00:06:51,601
on a last-chance power drive.

126
00:06:52,384 --> 00:06:55,342
Oh, you're gonna get
fucking cute now.

127
00:06:56,168 --> 00:06:57,333
Anything on Tony B.?

128
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,792
Nah, he's still
on a milk carton.

129
00:07:01,576 --> 00:07:03,292
There she is.

130
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,292
My smelly Valentine.

131
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,250
Christopher, that's not funny.

132
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:14,000
The fuck are you doing?

133
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,542
I can handle a cocktail
once in a while, right?

134
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:21,209
You guys okay?
You need anything else?

135
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:22,626
You still feeling sick, hon?

136
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,083
Please.

137
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:28,125
They gotta replace
her colon with a semicolon.

138
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:29,834
Maybe you should be a vegan.

139
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:31,918
The doctor says I gotta relax.

140
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,125
From what?

141
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:34,709
She's got the world at her feet,

142
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:37,500
she walks around
like impending doom.

143
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:39,584
Come on, we gotta go.

144
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:47,667
Take it easy, now.

145
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,417
Listen, don't listen to him.

146
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,834
People got their health,
they take it for granted.

147
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:56,792
How's your thing, the...?

148
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,542
Just gotta keep
an eye on it, that's all.

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,792
So Carm and me are getting
back together, maybe.

150
00:08:03,876 --> 00:08:05,042
That's great.

151
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,834
The kids'll be thrilled.

152
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:08,375
Yeah.

153
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:10,542
When we get settled,
we'll have you guys over.

154
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:12,459
You know, family dinner.

155
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:15,584
Feel better, huh?

156
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:26,500
John.

157
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:40,459
First off,

158
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:43,084
let me just say how sorry
I am for your loss.

159
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:44,542
We all are.

160
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,584
Take your fucking sorries
and stick them in your ass.

161
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:49,292
I could say nothing.

162
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,917
Be a heartless prick.

163
00:08:51,001 --> 00:08:54,250
He tried to talk, he couldn't
even say his last words.

164
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:58,292
Anybody ever die in your arms,
you cocksucker?

165
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,750
A family member?
Somebody you love?

166
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:02,459
No.

167
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,917
Well, give it time.

168
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,042
See if I can't
make that happen for you.

169
00:09:06,126 --> 00:09:07,833
- All right, that's enough.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

170
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:09,333
Philly, why don't you
go have a drink?

171
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:12,042
Don't tell me what to do, Jimmy.

172
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:14,459
Jimmy's right.

173
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:15,625
<i>Aspetta.</i>

174
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:18,168
Fuck 'em, John.
Fuck all of them.

175
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:28,001
Was that fucking necessary?

176
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:30,001
He shouldn't even
have been here.

177
00:09:30,084 --> 00:09:31,709
He's got a right to be here.

178
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:35,292
He's got a right to
a lot of things right now.

179
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,834
My cousin acted alone.
I did not sanction this.

180
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:39,667
The lone-gunman theory.

181
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,959
You know how close
he and Angelo were in the can.

182
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:43,500
He flipped the fuck out!

183
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:46,250
When he whacked Joey Peeps,
what flipped him out that time?

184
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,834
What do you want, John?
What do you want me to say?

185
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:52,625
I want your cousin
on a fucking spit!

186
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,709
I don't know where he is.

187
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:59,168
- Nobody does.
- Fine.

188
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:03,542
Maybe one of your
other relatives then.

189
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,500
What, I gotta stand here
being threatened now?

190
00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:07,001
All right, Chrissy...

191
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:09,542
All right, all right,
nobody's making threats.

192
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:14,709
Look, Tony's in hiding, John.

193
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:17,375
You either deliver
that prick to my door,

194
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,792
or I will rain a shit storm
down on you and your family

195
00:10:20,876 --> 00:10:23,500
like you have never
fucking seen.

196
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,250
We're done here.

197
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:52,001
There are over 200,000
species of mollusks,

198
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:55,084
and right there is
a good example of a conch,

199
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:58,709
which is also known
as a knobbed whelk.

200
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,084
See, these raised spines on it

201
00:11:00,168 --> 00:11:01,768
help keep it settled
wherever it lands...

202
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:04,959
That's what I call my dick.

203
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,667
I heard that.

204
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,292
That's just nasty.

205
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:12,042
Oh, fuck! Yo, check it!

206
00:11:12,126 --> 00:11:13,667
Oh, shit!

207
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,417
Hurry up!

208
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:21,584
Don't touch it!

209
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:24,500
Apprentice Delaney,
get back here!

210
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,250
Little Meadow in a bridal gown.

211
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:39,792
<i>Marone.</i> Couple more years,
Grandma and Grandpa.

212
00:11:39,876 --> 00:11:41,584
Bite your tongue.

213
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:49,250
So, the other day,
what you said.

214
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,042
I processed it.

215
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:52,667
Mm-hm.

216
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,292
You know, your feelings.

217
00:11:57,001 --> 00:12:00,417
It really hit home with me,
finally.

218
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:06,817
You know,
with you out of the house,

219
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:08,625
I've had a chance to do
a lot of thinking.

220
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:11,792
I mean, it's partly my fault,

221
00:12:11,876 --> 00:12:15,001
but I need something else
in my life.

222
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:18,500
You know, with Meadow
getting engaged, A.J. almost...

223
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:19,834
You want another kid.

224
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:22,709
No.

225
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:26,292
Mm.

226
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:39,584
It turns out there is a lot
for sale over on Crestview.

227
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:40,959
A little over an acre.

228
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:44,834
I was thinking
I could build a spec house

229
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:47,417
and take my dad in as a partner.

230
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,250
I mean, my allowance
is what it is, but...

231
00:12:54,084 --> 00:12:55,876
How much is the lot?

232
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,168
600,000.

233
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,500
Anyway, he would oversee
the construction.

234
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:10,584
Well, I'll call Ginsberg

235
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:14,625
and have him free up
a down payment.

236
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:16,042
And then?

237
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:19,417
I'll move back in.

238
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,417
Supposing that happened,

239
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,168
what about the other issues
that were on the table?

240
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,500
Well...

241
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:34,126
I swear to you, on our children,

242
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:37,584
that my midlife crisis problems

243
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:41,667
will no longer intrude
on you anymore.

244
00:13:49,084 --> 00:13:50,333
Okay.

245
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:02,834
- Hey.
- Hi.

246
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:04,209
What, are you having dinner?

247
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:06,876
Hey, you, have you settled
on a caterer yet?

248
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:09,500
Can I talk to you?

249
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,250
What's up? You hear from Tony?

250
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,541
I just talked to Kelvin, or Calvin,
whatever the fuck his name,

251
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:26,062
that redneck prick
from North Carolina.

252
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:28,206
He got a call from the Bureau
of Alcohol and Tobacco.

253
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:29,584
Some fucking bodega in Newark's

254
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,747
been selling cigarettes
without the tax stamps on it.

255
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:34,876
Stupid spics, they were supposed
to stamp them themselves.

256
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,959
The feds are all over it now.

257
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,168
I don't got enough
on my fucking mind?

258
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,709
Any idea how
you're gonna handle that?

259
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:48,126
Handle what?

260
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:51,459
Our cousin, you know,
Phil and John.

261
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:54,126
I don't know.
I gotta think about it.

262
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:58,459
From now on, Paulie supervises
the entire cigarette run.

263
00:14:58,542 --> 00:15:00,291
You split everything
down the middle with him.

264
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:02,042
- What?
- You fucking heard me.

265
00:15:02,126 --> 00:15:04,292
I got a fucking wedding
to pay for.

266
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,834
Well, if I were you,
I'd cut out the open bar.

267
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,876
Fuck this piece of shit.
I'm done! You hear me?

268
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,209
Put my life on the line!
My fucking life!

269
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:25,333
Baby, I hate
seeing you like this.

270
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:26,667
Fuck family, fuck loyalty.

271
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,417
You cost him a dime,
you're a fucking pariah.

272
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,876
I gave that fuck pieces
of my soul, Adriana.

273
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,375
You know what he said to me?

274
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,168
He said I should have
a fucking drink!

275
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,542
When?

276
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,959
Up there, when we were up
at Uncle Pat's farm.

277
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:42,667
Well, you don't need
to listen to him.

278
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,417
Isn't that why
you have a sponsor?

279
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,417
Him and Tony B.,
breaking my balls,

280
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,209
teasing me like
when I was little.

281
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:51,250
I mean, what kind of fucked-up,

282
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,084
undermining shit is that

283
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:55,834
to tell someone
who's got the disease?

284
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,876
You know I could take him out
in a second, that fat fuck.

285
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:03,625
Bang!

286
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:05,709
His kids wouldn't even
give a shit.

287
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:07,500
Don't talk like that.

288
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:10,042
You're a better man than he is.
A better person.

289
00:16:10,126 --> 00:16:11,646
Fuck all this shit
with Paulie and all.

290
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:15,001
You know what hurts me worse,
right to my heart?

291
00:16:15,084 --> 00:16:19,667
Him and our ass-wipe cousin,
that two-faced cocksucker.

292
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,667
He could get us all killed
with New York, and him,

293
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,292
Tony has to think about
what to do with him now,

294
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,834
after all this shit!

295
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:29,959
Me, he don't need
to fucking think!

296
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:34,459
Well, maybe I need to think!

297
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:38,001
Ever thought of that,
you fat fucking scumbag?

298
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:50,584
That's the guy, Adriana.

299
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:53,168
My Uncle Tony.

300
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:57,250
The guy I'm going to hell for.

301
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,500
Long Branch cops.

302
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:05,876
What do you think?

303
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,792
Not your average bulls.
Detectives.

304
00:17:09,876 --> 00:17:12,876
Call the Long Branch PD,
find out what's up.

305
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,459
So, you all set?

306
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:26,084
Don't look at me.

307
00:17:26,168 --> 00:17:27,917
Ah, you look good.

308
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:31,209
And you're gonna look nice
with the short hair.

309
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:34,042
Like what's-her-name.

310
00:17:34,126 --> 00:17:35,792
That actress.

311
00:17:35,876 --> 00:17:37,709
Just take me home.

312
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:40,126
I can drop you off,
but I really can't stay.

313
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:41,209
Why not?

314
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,500
All right, look, first off,
like I said before,

315
00:17:52,584 --> 00:17:55,333
as far as all the medical bills
and the prescriptions,

316
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:57,834
that's covered, ad nauseam.

317
00:17:57,917 --> 00:18:00,625
- You motherfucker.
- Hey, take it easy.

318
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:03,001
This is how you leave me?

319
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:05,792
When I'm almost burned to death
cooking you a fucking snack?

320
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,584
Come on, honey,
you could've just as easily

321
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:09,375
been making yourself
something to eat.

322
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:10,699
Am I that fucking horrible now?

323
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,542
No. You're not horrible at all.

324
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:19,959
- I'm going back to my wife.
- You selfish fuck.

325
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:24,459
I hate you.

326
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:29,084
Look, there's no future with us.
I told you that right from the get-go.

327
00:18:29,168 --> 00:18:32,917
That's why I didn't want you
hitching your wagon to my star.

328
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:35,126
No.

329
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:36,292
You'll heal up.

330
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,584
You'll meet somebody else.

331
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:38,834
Fuck you!

332
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:43,564
You know, I didn't
come here to fight.

333
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:47,959
I came here to pick you up
and end this like a gentleman.

334
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,500
I'm gonna fucking kill myself.

335
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:53,917
I gotta take this.

336
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,109
Hello?

337
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,500
<i>Is that you?</i>

338
00:19:05,184 --> 00:19:06,917
I know you're there, just
say something.

339
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:08,459
<i>Where the fuck are--?</i>

340
00:19:15,168 --> 00:19:17,417
Your call cannot be com...

341
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,709
Yeah.

342
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,667
- Bing.
<i>- Yeah, it's me.</i>

343
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,168
Your friend at the phone
company, have him call me.

344
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,292
- Who, Gerard?
- I want to put traps on all my lines.

345
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,625
Adriana.

346
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:44,001
Oh, Jesus. What?

347
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:45,209
We need to talk.

348
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:46,709
I was buying medicine.

349
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:48,126
- This way, please.
- Let's go.

350
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:49,709
But my car!

351
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,834
Hello?

352
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,792
- Hey.
- Hey.

353
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:14,292
Give me a hand, will you? Uh...

354
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:17,417
I got more stuff in the car, so...

355
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,001
Where should I put it?

356
00:20:20,126 --> 00:20:21,375
The bedroom.

357
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:24,084
Oh, you made it. Hey.

358
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:25,750
I was just starting dinner.

359
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:27,542
Yeah, smells good.

360
00:20:32,576 --> 00:20:33,750
What is this?

361
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:36,417
I got you something,
you know, small.

362
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,333
Oh, this is beautiful.

363
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:44,001
Tony! With my black coat.

364
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:47,292
It's a Hermès.

365
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,542
Supposed to be the best.

366
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:07,542
There's the whipped butter too,
if you like.

367
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,792
Oh, no, this is all right.

368
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:17,409
This is fucking weird.

369
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:20,233
A.J.

370
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:22,417
No, he's right.

371
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,709
It is fucking weird.

372
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,333
You know what?

373
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:30,042
We should celebrate.

374
00:21:31,209 --> 00:21:32,584
Oh!

375
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,542
Here, give me your glass.

376
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:40,709
The trick is,
you gotta hold the cork.

377
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:42,001
Don't let it fly out.

378
00:21:42,084 --> 00:21:43,876
Gab's uncle got
a detached retina

379
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:45,292
at his own retirement party.

380
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,084
He never saw out
of that eye again.

381
00:21:47,168 --> 00:21:49,168
That's festive.

382
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,459
I, uh...

383
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:53,500
I wanna make a toast.

384
00:21:58,001 --> 00:21:59,667
To the people I love.

385
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:03,792
Nothing else matters.

386
00:22:04,876 --> 00:22:06,584
- Hear, hear.
<i>- Salute</i>.

387
00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:14,750
Whoa, slow down, slow down.

388
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:17,792
You're supposed to savor it.

389
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:19,792
It's important in life.

390
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:30,519
<i>Open the door for Mr. Muckle!</i>

391
00:22:30,584 --> 00:22:31,601
<i>- What?
- Open the door</i>

392
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,759
<i>- for Mr. Muckle, the blind man.
- How about my kumquats?</i>

393
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:35,959
<i>What'd you say?</i>

394
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:37,542
<i>- Kumquats!
- Wait!</i>

395
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:45,625
<i>Wait a minute. Wait a minute.</i>

396
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:48,126
<i>It's all right. It's all right.</i>

397
00:22:48,209 --> 00:22:50,126
<i>All right.</i>

398
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:12,959
So?

399
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:16,250
I was throwing the
garbage out. So what?

400
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,500
Isn't that illegal anyway,

401
00:23:18,584 --> 00:23:20,042
to film people
without telling them?

402
00:23:20,126 --> 00:23:21,625
And the reason
you didn't just leave

403
00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:23,584
the garbage in the dumpster?

404
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:24,834
Bills and stuff.

405
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:27,042
Our account numbers were on it.

406
00:23:28,084 --> 00:23:29,667
Friend of yours?

407
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,625
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- His name is Gilbert Nieves.

408
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:35,168
There were partial traces
of an infrared stamp

409
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,709
on his hand
from the Crazy Horse.

410
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:38,001
I don't know him.

411
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,500
But you told
the Long Branch police

412
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,042
that he was at the club
that night.

413
00:23:41,126 --> 00:23:43,384
Let me ask you a question,
Miss La Cerva.

414
00:23:43,467 --> 00:23:45,417
Do you really think
we have you in here

415
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
because we don't know
what's in that garbage bag?

416
00:23:47,584 --> 00:23:48,959
He was stabbed in the club.

417
00:23:49,042 --> 00:23:51,084
You tried to dispose
of the evidence.

418
00:23:51,168 --> 00:23:53,375
- I didn't do nothin'.
- Miss La Cerva...

419
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:56,792
I suggest in the strongest
possible terms

420
00:23:56,876 --> 00:23:59,001
that you start telling us
what you know.

421
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:12,042
There's this guy.
His name's Matush.

422
00:24:12,126 --> 00:24:15,042
He's a drug dealer. He did it.

423
00:24:15,126 --> 00:24:16,625
I swear, not me.

424
00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:19,217
What's Matush's last name?

425
00:24:19,401 --> 00:24:20,709
I don't know.

426
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,042
He's foreign,
the Mideast or something.

427
00:24:23,126 --> 00:24:24,834
Pakistan.

428
00:24:24,917 --> 00:24:27,876
Anyway, Christopher don't
let him deal in the club,

429
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:32,168
but once in a while he'd sell
me some X or whatever.

430
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,917
Adriana. Hey.

431
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:36,126
Hey.

432
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:38,375
This is my friend Kamal.

433
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:40,333
Listen, I need a favor.

434
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:41,792
We're trying to get
an apartment.

435
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:44,042
I gotta fax the guy
a copy of my passport.

436
00:24:44,126 --> 00:24:45,459
You can't go to Kinko's?

437
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:46,667
The guy's waiting for it.

438
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,750
It will take two seconds,
I swear.

439
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,917
It's in the office, but hurry.

440
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:53,709
Christopher sees you in there, he'll shit.

441
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:54,917
Thanks.

442
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:56,876
That's for you.

443
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,625
This guy was at the club,
the dead guy.

444
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:16,168
But I never saw him before.

445
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,667
Matush said
he sold him coke once,

446
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,084
but the guy said Matush
ripped him off.

447
00:25:20,168 --> 00:25:21,750
Like, it was all laxative.

448
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:23,168
Oh, boy.

449
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:26,292
What's the number again?

450
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:28,042
Oh, it's...

451
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,375
Hey, yo, you can't
be back here, man.

452
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:32,459
Oh. Cool out, yo!
What are you doing?

453
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:33,959
- Give me my money.
- What?

454
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:35,749
- Give it to me!
- Don't get stupid in here.

455
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,001
- I'm serious.
- Fuck off.

456
00:25:37,084 --> 00:25:38,292
I got no beef with you.

457
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,834
You still sell
that beat shit, huh?

458
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:42,126
Fucking baby powder?

459
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:43,625
- Look, I don't know...
- Get him!

460
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,959
I'll kill you motherfuckers!

461
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:47,459
I'll kill you!

462
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,709
Oh, my God!

463
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:34,250
We had to wait till later
to get out the mops and stuff,

464
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:36,417
after we closed up.

465
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,584
What if Christopher--?

466
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:39,084
Nobody has to know anything.

467
00:26:39,168 --> 00:26:40,625
But you don't
fucking understand!

468
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:42,834
It's cool, okay?

469
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:45,001
We'll take him out
through the basement.

470
00:26:45,084 --> 00:26:46,542
Dump him in the ocean.

471
00:27:00,942 --> 00:27:02,917
Why'd you help this Matush?

472
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:05,876
I wasn't helping him.
I was afraid for myself.

473
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,417
Besides, he's nice.
I don't know.

474
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,292
I didn't wanna see him
get into trouble.

475
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:11,917
Sounds like a real sweetheart.

476
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:13,709
The guy was gonna stab him.

477
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,292
He's not a bad person.

478
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:17,292
He's very religious.

479
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:18,459
Religious?

480
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:20,584
He prays, like, all the time.

481
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:22,126
He went through this period

482
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:23,625
where he rediscovered
his religion.

483
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:26,292
He don't even do drugs anymore.
He just deals.

484
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:29,168
And every month, he sends all
his money home to his family.

485
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,917
In Pakistan?

486
00:27:32,168 --> 00:27:33,459
His brother runs a prep school.

487
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:35,917
Some place for young boys.

488
00:27:37,209 --> 00:27:39,042
I was very impressed with that.

489
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:45,500
He's buckled down. He's gotten
much more serious as a person.

490
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:47,084
Does Christopher know what
happened that night?

491
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:49,209
No! You crazy?

492
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,417
Right now, you're
guilty of obstructing

493
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,333
an ongoing investigation
into a drug-related homicide.

494
00:27:54,417 --> 00:27:56,709
You are looking down the barrel
at 25 years.

495
00:27:56,792 --> 00:27:58,333
But I didn't do nothing.

496
00:27:58,417 --> 00:27:59,916
Take your head
out of your ass, Adriana.

497
00:27:59,917 --> 00:28:01,291
You knew exactly
what you were doing.

498
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:02,876
We can arrest you right now,

499
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:04,500
have you formally charged,

500
00:28:04,584 --> 00:28:06,917
send you right over to
the Women's House of Detention.

501
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:10,250
Or, in the alternative,
you can cooperate.

502
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:12,709
But I've been fucking
cooperating!

503
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:15,709
You've been giving us shit,
and I've had it!

504
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:19,542
I want you wired up!
I want Tony Soprano on tape!

505
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:21,042
Your boyfriend too.

506
00:28:21,126 --> 00:28:23,333
No, I'm not doing it!

507
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:25,126
Then you're all out of options!

508
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:31,375
I wanna talk to my lawyer.

509
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:34,375
Fine, who's your lawyer?

510
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:36,834
I don't have an official one.

511
00:28:36,917 --> 00:28:39,001
Maybe Christopher
knows a good lawyer.

512
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,584
Oh, you fucking piece of shit.

513
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:44,750
I'll call the Public Defender.
They'll send someone down.

514
00:28:44,834 --> 00:28:47,709
Might take awhile, though,
this hour of the night.

515
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,500
Think I left
some shoes over there.

516
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,959
I can iron these tomorrow.

517
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,834
What for?
Send 'em to the cleaners.

518
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:12,709
I kind of miss it, actually.
My wrist is getting weak.

519
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,042
I could help you there.

520
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:20,084
Get out of here.

521
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:24,459
No, let's give it some exercise.

522
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:25,584
Tony...

523
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:27,209
- What?
- Stop.

524
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,792
<i>Hi, it's Ade.</i>

525
00:29:40,876 --> 00:29:42,876
<i>Ma, if this is you,
another gift for the registry</i>

526
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:44,168
<i>could be a decanter.</i>

527
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:48,001
Yeah, it's me. Where are you?

528
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:58,542
May be doing it at our house.

529
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:01,126
We've only got the one leaf
for 16 people.

530
00:30:01,209 --> 00:30:03,126
Could you do a buffet?

531
00:30:03,209 --> 00:30:05,292
Maybe set a card table up
for the kids?

532
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:06,625
It's our first holiday.

533
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:08,168
Ronnie wants us all together.

534
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:21,876
Ade? It's been 40 minutes.

535
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:23,417
How long you
gonna stay in there?

536
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,584
How long are you gonna
let me go without a lawyer?

537
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:27,168
I told you, they're backed up.

538
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,667
We left four messages.

539
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,625
Eight fucking hours
I been here already.

540
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:49,750
Oh, Jesus Christ, look at me.

541
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:52,042
You want some coffee?

542
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,084
I can't. My stomach.

543
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,542
I wish you'd think
about our offer.

544
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:00,209
It's not a bad deal.

545
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,459
I won't wear a wire, I told you.

546
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:06,209
It's bad enough
how I betrayed him already.

547
00:31:06,292 --> 00:31:08,084
It's not too late
to have a future, Ade.

548
00:31:08,168 --> 00:31:09,584
There are other options.

549
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:12,792
Don't start with
the Witness Protection again.

550
00:31:12,876 --> 00:31:14,196
You're young.
You love each other.

551
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,500
You both have your health.

552
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:17,542
Yeah, right.

553
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,584
I mean, living like this is
what's costing you your insides.

554
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:25,084
I really need a cigarette.

555
00:31:25,168 --> 00:31:27,250
Okay. Come on.

556
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:08,750
There's no way
she'll wear a wire,

557
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:11,115
but she think she might be able
to get Moltisanti to flip.

558
00:32:11,168 --> 00:32:13,375
- Why now?
- Problems with Tony.

559
00:32:13,459 --> 00:32:14,779
Christopher hates him,
apparently.

560
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:16,126
That's confirmed by wiretaps.

561
00:32:16,209 --> 00:32:17,667
And, uh, CI-12 mentioned it too.

562
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,709
Something to do
with Tony Blundetto, the cousin.

563
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:23,459
- What would Moltisanti want?
- I'm not sure.

564
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,333
He's got some interest
in screenwriting.

565
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:27,500
I'll put in a call
to Sam Goldwyn.

566
00:32:27,584 --> 00:32:29,208
- You promise her anything?
- No guarantees,

567
00:32:29,209 --> 00:32:30,709
but depending on
what he's offering,

568
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:34,126
maybe immunity and relocation
for the two of them.

569
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:41,876
She's got to understand
that if she won't wear a wire,

570
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:44,584
we can't offer her protection
or keep her surveilled.

571
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:46,709
- I explained all that.
- Tell her she's got

572
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:48,834
till 9:00 a.m. Monday
to bring him in,

573
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:51,292
or we turn her over
to Long Branch PD.

574
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,126
Ton', you got a call.

575
00:32:59,284 --> 00:33:01,800
Jimmy Petrille, uh, Brooklyn.

576
00:33:04,042 --> 00:33:05,750
- Hello.
<i>- It's me.</i>

577
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:07,500
That tennis match
with those guys?

578
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,876
My guy won.

579
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:10,917
- Oh, yeah?
<i>- The other one, the son.</i>

580
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:12,584
- He dropped out.
- What, he got hurt?

581
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:14,001
Nothing like that.

582
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:16,209
- It's settled, that's all.
- All right.

583
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:21,917
Little Carmine's out.

584
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:23,709
He's dead?

585
00:33:23,792 --> 00:33:26,792
Seems like him and Johnny
worked out a deal.

586
00:33:26,876 --> 00:33:30,001
I knew he'd cave.
He's a fucking pussy, that kid.

587
00:33:30,084 --> 00:33:33,168
Johnny Sack, boss of a family.

588
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,168
Time was it would've been great
for us to have John as the boss.

589
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,001
Smart as a fucking whip.

590
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:40,126
He used to be a pragmatist.

591
00:33:40,209 --> 00:33:42,667
Some people are better
at being number twos.

592
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,584
You thought John
had an ego before?

593
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:45,876
Forget it now.

594
00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:50,792
Hey.

595
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:04,168
You sleep?

596
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,625
A little.

597
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:07,500
So where the fuck you been?

598
00:34:07,584 --> 00:34:09,959
Christopher, we need to talk.

599
00:34:10,042 --> 00:34:12,542
I asked you a question, Adriana.

600
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:14,042
I know.

601
00:34:14,126 --> 00:34:15,566
There's something
I need to tell you.

602
00:34:15,584 --> 00:34:17,625
It's that fucking Bobby DeMarco?

603
00:34:17,709 --> 00:34:18,876
No.

604
00:34:18,959 --> 00:34:20,500
Please, Christopher.

605
00:34:23,292 --> 00:34:25,375
I gotta get through this.

606
00:34:30,084 --> 00:34:31,750
About a year ago...

607
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:34,001
more maybe,
I-I-I-I don't know...

608
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,126
I was arrested.

609
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:39,500
For what?
What are you talking about?

610
00:34:39,584 --> 00:34:41,001
For drugs.

611
00:34:41,084 --> 00:34:43,792
Where, at the club?

612
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,500
Remember my friend Danielle?

613
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,733
She set you up?

614
00:34:47,817 --> 00:34:50,692
She was an FBI agent,
Christopher.

615
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:05,375
She lied to me.

616
00:35:05,459 --> 00:35:07,500
They wanted to arrest you too,
Christopher.

617
00:35:07,584 --> 00:35:10,292
I was just trying
to protect you.

618
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,215
They said all they wanted
was some information,

619
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,209
and they would leave us alone.

620
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:17,333
I didn't tell them nothing,
I swear to God.

621
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:20,959
Just license plates,
some other stupid shit.

622
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:24,250
They wanted me to wear a wire,
but I wouldn't do it.

623
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:27,792
But now there was a murder,
Christopher,

624
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,625
and they know about it.

625
00:35:30,709 --> 00:35:34,959
At the club,
Matush and some other guy.

626
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:37,709
I tried to cover it up,

627
00:35:37,792 --> 00:35:40,126
but I had no choice.

628
00:35:40,209 --> 00:35:43,126
They've been filming us
in the parking lot.

629
00:35:56,126 --> 00:35:57,917
We're dead! you know that?

630
00:35:58,001 --> 00:36:00,667
What did you do, huh?

631
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,876
How could you
fucking do this to us?

632
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,750
I fucking loved you.

633
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,500
I'm sorry.

634
00:36:20,584 --> 00:36:23,084
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

635
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,792
I'm sorry.

636
00:36:24,876 --> 00:36:26,168
Oh...

637
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:29,667
Oh!

638
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,375
Oh, my God!

639
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:43,168
Oh, my God!
What are we gonna do?

640
00:36:54,459 --> 00:36:56,209
<i>Careful here, my son.</i>

641
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:59,292
<i>What I do for friendship.</i>

642
00:37:10,384 --> 00:37:11,401
Hello.

643
00:37:11,684 --> 00:37:13,084
T, it's me.

644
00:37:13,168 --> 00:37:14,375
<i>You awake?</i>

645
00:37:17,876 --> 00:37:19,168
Look, I know you're mad, okay?

646
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:22,333
Ton', I'm sorry.

647
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:23,834
When I heard about
Angelo, I just--

648
00:37:23,917 --> 00:37:26,001
Don't fucking say it.
Not on the phone.

649
00:37:26,084 --> 00:37:27,542
I know. I won't.

650
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:32,750
What should I do, Ton'?

651
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,375
I'll tell you what not to do.

652
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:36,001
That's come back around here.

653
00:37:36,584 --> 00:37:37,950
I know.

654
00:37:38,234 --> 00:37:39,250
I know, but...

655
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:40,792
my kids, my boys.

656
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:42,792
Don't worry about that.
I'll look after them.

657
00:37:42,876 --> 00:37:44,750
Yeah, well, that's why
I'm calling, you know,

658
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:46,042
to ask if you'd--

659
00:37:46,126 --> 00:37:47,792
Sure. Why not?

660
00:37:49,042 --> 00:37:51,042
Anything else I can do for you?

661
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:53,876
I don't know what to say, cos.

662
00:37:54,759 --> 00:37:57,709
I'm leaving you with a real pile
of shit in your lap.

663
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:05,917
<i>Hello?</i>

664
00:38:06,001 --> 00:38:07,584
The night you went away,

665
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:09,584
<i>you know, 17 years ago,</i>

666
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:14,042
I told you that I got jumped
by a couple of shines.

667
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:17,834
<i>That's why I didn't show.</i>

668
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:19,834
That was all bullshit.

669
00:38:22,001 --> 00:38:24,292
I got in a fight with my mother,
and I passed out.

670
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:26,401
What do you mean?

671
00:38:26,425 --> 00:38:28,876
I don't know. It...
it was like a panic attack.

672
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:30,292
I went down
like a house of cards,

673
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:32,042
and I cracked my fucking
skull open.

674
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:34,750
Why are you telling me all this?

675
00:38:35,334 --> 00:38:37,250
Because I felt guilty
about it all these years,

676
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:39,667
like it was my fault
you went away.

677
00:38:43,959 --> 00:38:45,750
Anyway, now we're even.

678
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:47,250
So the casino,

679
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:50,050
all that shit you did for me
is 'cause of that?

680
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:56,667
You just take care
of yourself, all right?

681
00:38:58,333 --> 00:38:59,625
You too.

682
00:39:16,834 --> 00:39:18,500
<i>Hello?</i>

683
00:39:18,584 --> 00:39:20,709
Gerard, it's me.

684
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,126
He just called.

685
00:39:23,209 --> 00:39:25,126
<i>Give me a sec,
I'll dump the line.</i>

686
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:28,792
<i>You got a pen?</i>

687
00:39:28,876 --> 00:39:30,333
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go ahead.

688
00:39:30,417 --> 00:39:31,876
<i>He's at Roy's.</i>

689
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:34,292
<i>It's a business.
Kinderhook, New York.</i>

690
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:35,625
<i>That's upstate.</i>

691
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,917
Yeah, I know where it is.

692
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,250
Thanks.

693
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:55,625
Hello?

694
00:39:55,709 --> 00:39:57,209
<i>Oh! Uncle Pat.</i>

695
00:39:57,292 --> 00:39:59,209
So how's life
at the old folks' home?

696
00:39:59,292 --> 00:40:01,042
I don't like the people here.

697
00:40:01,126 --> 00:40:02,333
<i>Do you know what time it is?</i>

698
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:04,834
Come on, I thought
you were a night owl.

699
00:40:05,717 --> 00:40:07,018
<i>Did I hear a rumor</i>

700
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:08,793
there was a problem
up there at the farm?

701
00:40:08,876 --> 00:40:10,834
<i>Ah, the goddamn developer.</i>

702
00:40:10,917 --> 00:40:12,042
Some environmental crap.

703
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:14,001
They can't start the demolition

704
00:40:14,084 --> 00:40:16,001
without some special permit.

705
00:40:16,084 --> 00:40:18,135
And the house is sitting
there empty,

706
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:18,834
<i>damn it.</i>

707
00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:23,542
Remember that...
that time at Lake George,

708
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:24,959
how you loved it?

709
00:40:25,042 --> 00:40:27,417
We could live someplace
like that, maybe.

710
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,500
You could start writing again.

711
00:40:29,584 --> 00:40:32,084
I could do my memoirs, finally.

712
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:36,959
And we'd have a fireplace
like you like too.

713
00:40:38,168 --> 00:40:40,375
We could never come
back here, Adriana.

714
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:42,126
I don't wanna come back.

715
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:43,417
I just want you.

716
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,417
You couldn't even see
your mother again.

717
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:54,417
You want some eggs?

718
00:40:55,417 --> 00:40:56,917
I need to clear my head.

719
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:00,667
You didn't even sleep.

720
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,625
This is a lot to process,
Adriana.

721
00:41:02,709 --> 00:41:04,959
I gotta think.

722
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:06,667
I'll be back in a little while.

723
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:07,959
Stay, wait.

724
00:41:08,042 --> 00:41:09,292
I'm just gonna get cigarettes.

725
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:11,168
- I'll be right back.
- Smoke mine.

726
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,542
Don't smoke.

727
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:14,001
Next you're gonna want a vodka.

728
00:41:14,084 --> 00:41:15,250
What?

729
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:16,792
Come on.

730
00:41:18,834 --> 00:41:20,917
I love you, baby.

731
00:41:21,001 --> 00:41:22,500
I love you.

Hello.

734
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,168
- He wants to do it.
- Great. When are you coming in?

735
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,876
A couple of more hours. We're
just getting some things together.

736

That's not what we said, Ade.

737
00:41:50,834 --> 00:41:52,667
Please, if I push him
he'll say no.

Jesus, I don't even know
how to say this.

745
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:19,333
It's Christopher.

746
00:43:19,417 --> 00:43:21,084
He tried to commit suicide.

747
00:43:21,168 --> 00:43:22,750
Oh, my God, is he all right?

748
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:23,917
He's fine.

749
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:25,126
He was up by Ramapo.

750
00:43:25,209 --> 00:43:27,126
He apparently took some pills.

751
00:43:27,209 --> 00:43:29,417
And this trooper found him in
a bathroom of this diner,

752
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,834
and they brought him
to the hospital.

753

<i>His mom's on her way
up there now.</i>

754
00:43:34,417 --> 00:43:36,192
Did he say anything to you?

755
00:43:36,476 --> 00:43:38,876
I mean, did he appear suicidal?

756
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:41,317
- No.
<i>- Are you sure?</i>

757
00:43:41,801 --> 00:43:45,325
Because his mom said he's
very upset about something.

758
00:43:46,001 --> 00:43:47,750
Anyway, I'm on my way
up there now,

760
00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:53,292
- Jesus Christ.
- You know he's been drinking,

761
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:55,625
so he's probably fighting
that heroin urge again.

762

And?

817
00:49:23,667 --> 00:49:26,292
I know this has to be done, John,

818
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:29,333

as a friend.

00:49:30,917 --> 00:49:32,542
Let me handle this myself.

00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,667
You're the fucking boss.

823
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,126

it'll be quick.

I don't have to.

You think you're alone in this?

847
00:52:09,917 --> 00:52:12,750
It was a judgment call.
She sounded okay.

848
00:52:12,834 --> 00:52:14,417
What's the status on Moltisanti?

849
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,499
Last seen yesterday, he was
leaving the Bing with Tony.

850
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,375
- Should we bring him in?
- That'll get us nothing.

851
00:52:19,459 --> 00:52:21,834
She really could have fled.
She could be in China by now.

852

thing, the Nieves murder?

00:53:35,959 --> 00:53:38,709
Yeah, it's a gorgeous
piece of land.

857
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:40,959

858
00:53:41,042 --> 00:53:43,459
