You were right.
Forensics has signed off on him.

32
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:51,876
The body can be released.

33
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:54,709
Phil, why don't you wait until
they fix him up over there?

34
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:58,542
I promised our mother I'd see
him like we knew him, Jimmy,

35
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:01,250
before they put on
all that pancake and shit.

36
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:24,333
Your funeral
director's car is here.

37
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:26,417
I'll go down and meet them.

38
00:02:33,042 --> 00:02:35,584
John, how long I gotta wait?

39
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:37,750
Tony Soprano
left to his own device

40
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:41,084
is never gonna give up
that fucking animal Blundetto.

41
00:02:41,168 --> 00:02:42,584
Philly...

42
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,459
An eye for an eye?

43
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:59,625
This is kind of fun.

44
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:04,042
But if I was you,
I'd dump this job.

45
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:06,375
I'd go to Italy.

46
00:03:10,042 --> 00:03:12,709
This is no way
for a caretaker to live.

47
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:16,667
Well, a few things have
to settle down first.

48
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,084
My cousin'll send me
the funds to go through Canada.

49
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,542
Italy. Wow.

50
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,168
Nice cousin.

51
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:35,250
Oh, hey,
thanks for that massage!

52
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,709
My toe doesn't hurt
hardly at all now.

53
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:45,292
Watch the windows.

54
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,500
Ho!

55
00:03:48,584 --> 00:03:50,209
Excuse me.

56
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:51,375
How you doing?

57
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:53,750
- You're Joanne, right?
- Who are you?

58
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,584
Well, we're friends
of your son's.

59
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:58,292
My son doesn't live with me.

60
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:01,625
We're from Alcoholics Anonymous.

61
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,168
What's your name?

62
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,542
Well, we're anonymous.

63
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,209
I see his car's out front.

64
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:08,917
He went to California or Vegas.

65
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:10,084
I don't know.

66
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:11,417
California or Vegas.

67
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,709
When did he leave?

68
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:14,126
Sorry, I have to go to work.

69
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:16,250
- Where the fuck is he?
- Phil...

70
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,250
Leave me alone.

71
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,917
I had a brother your son's age.

72
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:22,084
Please let go of my hand.

73
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:24,209
Where the fuck is he,
you fuckin' cunt?

74
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:27,709
I'll take that Discman,
and I'll ram it up your box.

75
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:29,459
Philly, Philly, please.

76
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:30,917
Please.

77
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:32,292
It's the guy's mother, Phil.

78
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,750
It's the guy's mother.

79
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:42,292
Oh, man.
Those jocks are juicers.

80
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,834
They'll do it
just for the free brew.

81
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,459
You're still here?

82
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:47,709
I'm driving to school.
I don't have to leave as early.

83
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:49,876
He'll bring some cool people.

84
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:52,375
- Hey, what are you doing up?
- Snowblower.

85
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:57,168
It seems to me you are not
sleeping that well, period.

86
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,292
- And look at you.
- I told A.J. to fix this leak

87
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,375
while I was still
living at my mother's.

88
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:07,704
What's going on with him?
Every time I go by the room,

89
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:09,959
he's flopped down on the bed,
on the phone.

90
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:11,792
I am so sick of nagging him.

91
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:14,250
And if he thinks he's gonna get
into East Stroudsburg State,

92
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,500
he is sadly mistaken.

93
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:25,084
Look at this kid out there,
the gardener's son.

94
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:27,126
Can't ask this one
to take out the trash.

95
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:28,959
Poverty is a great motivator.

96
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,667
You think we gave A.J. too much?

97
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,168
Then you look at Meadow.
Same house, same everything.

98
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,001
- She's doing great.
- She takes after you, maybe.

99
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:44,001
Don't do that. He's my son too.

100
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,084
Well, I got that appointment
with his coach today.

101
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:50,542
Maybe he's got a clue.

102
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,542
- Hello?
- In here, Dad.

103
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:58,333
Hey, there's my little
amaretto cookie.

104
00:05:58,417 --> 00:06:00,959
Clear a place so we can
take a look at these.

105
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:03,126
They're only
preliminary drawings.

106
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:05,292
I've got scones
if anybody wants.

107
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,895
Hey, Meadow, take a look at the
house your mother's gonna build.

108
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,667
Well, and Grandpa, of course.

109
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,959
Tony, Ignatz is responsible
for those Normandy chateaux

110
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:14,292
up on Tisch Drive.

111
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,459
Oh.

112
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,709
Wow, look at that entry.

113
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:18,625
What is that,
like three stories high?

114
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:42,126
T?

115
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:43,876
Christopher, hi, it's Carmela.

116
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,417
<i>- Is Adriana there?</i>
- No.

117
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,333
<i>I was just wondering
what was going on.</i>

118
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:49,126
I stopped by Fortunoff's.

119
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,834
She was supposed to
get back to them

120
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:52,834
with a final decision
about her china pattern,

121
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:54,500
<i>and she hasn't
returned their calls.</i>

122
00:06:54,584 --> 00:06:56,500
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

123
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,667
We broke up.

124
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,168
What?

125
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,709
Why? What happened?

126
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:05,250
Nothing. She left.

127
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,750
Broke my heart.

128
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:08,834
Moved out a couple of days ago,
I haven't seen her.

129
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:09,868
<i>Oh, no,</i>

130
00:07:09,892 --> 00:07:10,542
that's terrible.

131
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,625
<i>- Are you all right?</i>
- She stiffed me on the club.

132
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:15,375
Never showed up for work.
Place is rudderless.

133
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:16,584
Oh, my God!

134
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:17,917
Is there anything I can do?

135
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:19,542
Nah.

136
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,375
Well, look, I gotta go.

137
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:22,834
Somebody's waiting for me.

138
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:24,168
<i>I am devastated.</i>

139
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,500
I wish I could reach her.
Is there a number?

140
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:28,250
Not that I know of.

141
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,055
<i>Chris, listen,</i>

142
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,667
there's other fish in the sea.

143
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:35,459
I know. Thanks.

144
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,209
Tony Soprano and Vito Spatafore

145
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:03,772
talking about
the bus station project.

146
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:06,750
Adriana La Cerva.
The way we make it,

147
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:08,874
she's either taken off
or maybe even gotten clipped.

148
00:08:08,876 --> 00:08:10,667
- You hear anything?
- Clipped? Why?

149
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:14,333
Stepping out on her boyfriend.

150
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,750
I heard she took off.

151
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:18,126
Any idea where?

152
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:19,917
How should I know?
He's a dope addict.

153
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:22,126
Did I already give you that?

154
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,959
If you hear anything,
let me know.

155
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:27,625
Say hello to Ike and the guys.

156
00:08:32,584 --> 00:08:34,542
T's held up.

157
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,126
He said to start without him.

158
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:38,959
- All right?
- Yeah. All right.

159
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:42,001
What can we say about this guy?

160
00:08:42,084 --> 00:08:44,084
The ancient Romans
had a word for it:

161
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:47,000
"Asshole."

162
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:51,292
In all candor, though,
we love you, Raymond.

163
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,292
<i>Buon natale. Cento anni.</i>

164
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,126
Cento anni. <i><i>Salute</i></i>.

165
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:56,459
Thank you.

166
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,168
Take that setup away.
He ain't coming.

167
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,209
- Who, Chris?
- South with the geese.

168
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,792
Christopher is the logical
sacrifice bunt.

169
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:08,542
- To make up for the dead brother.
- I'm his brother-in-law.

170
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,459
You think New York is really
gonna come after you, Bobby?

171
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:12,917
Fuck do I know?

172
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:14,417
If you're them,
you want somebody

173
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,042
close to Tony as possible.

174
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:18,001
And who knows him
better and longer?

175
00:09:18,784 --> 00:09:21,625
Don't think Johnny's not gonna
put a financial squeeze on all of us.

176
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:25,250
Tell me about it. I'm already getting
fucked with by Johnny's people.

177
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,126
- It's not good.
- All due respect,

178
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:30,834
I'm willing to die
for a good cause.

179
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:32,126
But this is bullshit.

180
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:34,042
There he is!

181
00:09:34,126 --> 00:09:36,042
- Hey!
- Sit down. Sit down.

182
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,459
What's going on?

183
00:09:42,109 --> 00:09:44,126
Vito misto, how are you?

184
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,417
Happy birthday, Ray.

185
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,084
Thanks for coming, Ton'.

186
00:09:48,168 --> 00:09:49,750
I brought these plus...

187
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:51,126
that's a good one.

188
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:52,959
<i>Acuto di Soprano.</i>

189
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:55,417
I serve it at my house.
It's from Avellino.

190
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,584
My grandfather said that some
of my ancestors were winemakers,

191
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,333
but what the fuck do I know?

192
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:02,001
Thanks, Ton'.

193
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:03,333
That's gonna be a treasure.

194
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:06,168
Yeah, well, whatever.

195
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:08,876
Larry!

196
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,292
The fuck are you doing here?

197
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,042
I though you were
under house arrest.

198
00:10:12,126 --> 00:10:14,584
Fuck them. I ever see that
prison doctor, God forbid,

199
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,667
I'm gonna say, "Hey, fuck stick",

200
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,624
"did they ever show you these
in medical school?

201
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,126
They're called balls."

202
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:21,500
Good for you!

203
00:10:23,584 --> 00:10:24,959
Listen, I can't stay.

204
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,542
Oh, oh, oh!

205
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,959
I got a meeting I gotta go to.

206
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:30,292
Got something I wanna say.

207
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:37,001
My cousin Anthony
went into business for himself,

208
00:10:37,084 --> 00:10:38,625
we all know this,

209
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:41,417
in a way for which
there is no excuse.

210
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:44,042
He's got a problem with rage.

211
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:46,667
He disappointed me, Anthony,

212
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,625
in ways that I can't
even begin to tell you.

213
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:53,417
And he put us all at risk.

214
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,250
Irregardless,

215
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:57,675
it's been made clear to me

216
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:00,417
that if they put
their hands on him,

217
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,584
he will not be dealt with quick.

218
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,333
We're talking torture.

219
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:08,917
For that reason, even if
I knew where my cousin was,

220
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,500
and I do not,

221
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:13,500
I would not deliver him
up to them.

222
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,333
I am offering him
the same protection

223
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:21,084
that I would offer any of you
in similar circumstances.

224
00:11:21,168 --> 00:11:22,349
Now, I know what you're
gonna say. You're gonna say,

225
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,417
"Hey, Ton', I would
never do what he did."

226
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,292
God bless, I hope not.

227
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,126
But we are a family.

228
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:31,959
And even in this fucked-up day
and age, that means something.

229
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:35,500
So we are gonna deal with this
as a family, together.

230
00:11:35,584 --> 00:11:38,876
No matter how it affects
anybody personal safety-wise,

231
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,667
financially-wise, whatever.

232
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:49,168
I see that my nephew isn't here,

233
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,959
and it's important
he lam it now.

234
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:55,667
It's my desire that you circle
the wagons, you support him.

235
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,625
Until and as such...

236
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:11,209
Raymond.

237
00:12:11,292 --> 00:12:13,459
I'm sorry I can't stay.

238
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,333
Happy birthday, huh?

239
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:17,500
Thanks.

240
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:19,333
Gentlemen, enjoy your dinner.

241
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:21,042
See you, T.

242
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:28,542
Thank you.

243
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:29,834
That was great.

244
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:35,182
Thought you had Raymond's
birthday dinner.

245
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:37,084
I left early.

246
00:12:37,168 --> 00:12:38,542
It's nice you're home.

247
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,542
There's chicken parm.

248
00:12:44,834 --> 00:12:46,417
Was Christopher there?

249
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,459
Uh... no.

250
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:52,584
Did you know that him
and Adriana broke up?

251
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:54,375
No.

252
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:56,417
This kid, that's his trouble.

253
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,084
He keeps it all bottled up.

254
00:12:58,168 --> 00:13:01,376
Then they wonder why they get
chemical dependencies.

255
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:08,625
Oh, man!

256
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,792
Do you think there was
somebody else?

257
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:17,792
Because there was
this one night,

258
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:20,250
it was way back, it was
movie night with the girls.

259
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,834
Adriana was very upset,

260
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,541
and she wanted to get
something off her chest.

261
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:25,417
Then she just ran
out of there, crying.

262
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,459
You know, I'll bet
she was seeing somebody.

263
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:31,333
You never know about people.

264
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,292
<i>His plans were often startling,</i>

265
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:39,375
<i>instinctive, spontaneous,
and not infrequently, obscure.</i>

266
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:44,001
<i>His men idolized him
and had boundless faith in him.</i>

267
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:48,126
<i>After being promoted in 1916,</i>

268
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:50,084
<i>he joyfully returned
home on leave</i>

269
00:13:50,168 --> 00:13:53,333
<i>to marry his sweetheart,
Lucie Maria Mollin.</i>

270
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:58,625
<i>She would be the love
of his life to its end.</i>

271
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:01,876
<i>Rommel saw the huge
assault on France forming,</i>

272
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:05,500
<i>and he saw that the new
armored weapon would be...</i>

273
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:07,792
I still love
this old house so much.

274
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:10,250
I should do half so good

275
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,250
with my stupid project.

276
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,749
<i>...Panzer division was almost</i>

277
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,084
<i>precisely what he had done</i>

278
00:14:15,168 --> 00:14:18,042
<i>as a lieutenant
during World War I.</i>

279
00:14:18,126 --> 00:14:20,417
<i>He was directing the efforts
of a single tank...</i>

280
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,333
I'm sorry, did you
want to be alone?

281
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,917
No. No.

282
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:28,126
<i>...but it was blitzkrieg
in its truest form.</i>

283
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:29,917
<i>It was Rommel...</i>

284
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:57,126
<i>He had what the
Germans call Fingerspitzengefühl,</i>

285
00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:00,042
<i>which is a sixth sense</i>

286
00:15:00,126 --> 00:15:03,292
<i>of sizing up a situation.</i>

287
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:07,500
<i>♪ They'll lay you down low ♪</i>

288
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:09,375
<i>♪ In the easy ♪</i>

289
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,168
<i>♪ And the lips that you kiss ♪</i>

290
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,667
<i>♪ Will say Christmas ♪</i>

291
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:24,292
Hey.

292
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,250
Claude Rains.

293
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,917
Thanks for doing this.

294
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:31,375
About 1,500 there.
Should tide you over.

295
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:33,250
Hey, Sil. Hey, kid.

296
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,333
You want something? Fries?

297
00:15:36,117 --> 00:15:39,042
- Fucking something, this situation, huh?
- Right.

298
00:15:39,126 --> 00:15:42,333
I can't even get down to Milt's,
fence some jewelry.

299
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:44,792
Everybody with eyes
in the back of their head.

300
00:15:44,876 --> 00:15:46,126
Shit, I was Tony's driver.

301
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:47,709
It's amazing.

302
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:49,209
You want me to be honest?

303
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:52,375
The favoritism Tony still
shows for our fucking cousin,

304
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:54,042
after what he's done?

305
00:15:54,126 --> 00:15:56,333
What does Tony B.
have on this guy?

306
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:58,458
And I'm supposed to maybe
take a bullet for the skeeve.

307
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:01,250
After all your uncle's
done for you,

308
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,292
I need to get into specifics?

309
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:20,209
Said you went home.

310
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,750
Ah, Trisha.

311
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:26,001
Just heard her old man died.

312
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:27,459
I'll give her a call.

313
00:16:37,417 --> 00:16:40,584
Actually, I've been hanging
around on purpose.

314
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,168
I gotta talk to you, Ton'.

315
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,584
About what?

316
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:49,375
Ton', look, I've been your
consigliere for a lot of years--

317
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:51,333
Don't go into
a fucking preamble.

318
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:53,084
Just tell me
what's on your mind.

319
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:55,333
You got some unhappy
people out there.

320
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:56,584
No shit.

321
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:58,542
Not just the young guys.

322
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,025
Talking about guys that've been
with you since the beginning.

323
00:17:01,084 --> 00:17:02,709
Since before the beginning.

324
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:05,459
- Guys who worked for your father.
- Fucking Paulie, right?

325
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:06,709
I'm not saying nothing.

326
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,126
Yeah, well, goddamn him.

327
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:11,333
These guys, Ton',
would do whatever you ordered.

328
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:15,959
Except in this case.

329
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:17,292
Don't say it like that.

330
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,001
Forget that Tony Blundetto's
my cousin.

331
00:17:19,884 --> 00:17:22,500
I give him up, we can give
the whole fucking thing up.

332
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:25,667
Here's where the conversation
gets difficult.

333
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,209
Go.

334
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:28,500
All due respect.

335
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:31,877
You were ready to hand him
your cousin a week ago.

336
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,375
So it's not about
standing with the guys

337
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:36,417
or upholding some rules.

338
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,584
Not really.

339
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,126
Then what's it all about?

340
00:17:39,209 --> 00:17:40,709
Why don't you illuminate me?

341
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:43,250
It's about you don't wanna
eat shit from John.

342
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:46,292
You don't wanna bow down.

343
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,667
You told him to go fuck himself.

344
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,750
Which, to be honest,

345
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:53,001
wasn't exactly appropriate,
considering.

346
00:17:53,084 --> 00:17:55,250
- Oh, is that right?
- All due respect.

347
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,001
What the fuck do you know
what goes on in my head?

348
00:17:58,084 --> 00:18:00,375
I've known you since
you were a kid, Ton'.

349
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:04,500
Frankly, you got a problem
with authority.

350
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:10,126
This attitude of yours,

351
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:13,209
it's a lot of what's made you
an effective leader.

352
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,792
But we all got flaws.

353
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:16,584
Even you.

354
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,126
Seven deadly sins,

355
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:20,375
and yours is pride.

356
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:28,375
All due respect.

357
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:30,500
You got no fucking idea

358
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:32,084
what it's like to be number one.

359
00:18:32,168 --> 00:18:35,126
Every decision you make
affects every facet

360
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:36,959
of every other fucking thing.

361
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:38,792
It's too much
to deal with, almost.

362
00:18:38,876 --> 00:18:40,417
And in the end,

363
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,409
you're completely alone
with it all.

364
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:50,250
I'm sorry you feel that way.

365
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,917
This is the course I've chosen,

366
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:54,750
and those of you
that are not with me on it,

367
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,792
well, that makes me sad.

368
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:58,750
And it'll be dealt with in time.

369
00:19:15,876 --> 00:19:17,709
You need me for anything else?

370
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,667
Benny, right?

371
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,209
How you doing, Mr. Leotardo?

372
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:15,500
I'm sitting listening
to WFAN and I go,

373
00:20:15,584 --> 00:20:17,424
isn't that the kid
that used to drive for Tony?

374
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:18,876
I'm on my way to the hospital.

375
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:20,417
Well, that's up to you.

376
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,584
No, no, I mean my mom, she...

377
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:25,387
- Where's your boss's friend?
- What friend?

378
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:27,084
Don't fuck with me, kid!

379
00:20:27,168 --> 00:20:28,584
Don't fuck with me!

380
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:43,209
Where's Blundetto?

381
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:45,459
I don't know! Ah!

382
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,126
It's a start.

383
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:01,417
Hey, Ton'.

384
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,959
Hey, Ton'.

385
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:15,042
Jesus.

386
00:21:16,126 --> 00:21:17,584
He has a fractured skull.

387
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,375
Is he talking at all?

388
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:25,126
A little.

389
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,084
Listen, Ben,
I want you to know that...

390
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,490
it's all gonna be taken care of

391
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:39,126
through the plumber's
union health plan.

392
00:21:39,209 --> 00:21:40,625
I'm gonna see to that.

393
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:46,709
You know what?
We were talking here,

394
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:49,667
and I think it's time for you
to get your own customers.

395
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,084
You're getting a little too old
to be beating people up.

396
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:01,250
- Where's Larry?
- He's staying home.

397
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,917
He's the boy's godfather.

398
00:22:03,001 --> 00:22:05,417
It was him who called, said
he was gonna be with the kid.

399
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,500
House arrest.

400
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:13,459
All right.

401
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:22,667
This is fucked up.

402
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,916
What do you wanna do about it?

403
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:26,333
What do I wanna do about it?

404
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:28,125
I want that man there
to do something about it.

405
00:22:28,126 --> 00:22:30,667
I want him to give us the okay
to drive over to Brooklyn,

406
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,834
clean some fucking
timepieces over there.

407
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:36,333
Tony Blundetto whacked
the brother of a captain.

408
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:38,126
If Tony tried to strike
at them again,

409
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:39,417
we should take him out.

410
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:47,917
Look, just give me
that first one.

411
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:49,500
The Oregonian.

412
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:51,084
$39.95.

413
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:56,126
You're sending a fruit basket
to the kid.

414
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,542
He'll appreciate it.

415
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:00,168
It's for Mel.
The poor guy had a stroke.

416
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,209
You believe it?
He's younger than me.

417
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:04,126
Melvoin?

418
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:05,876
Jesus Christ, that's terrible.

419
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,709
That's why I asked you
to come over.

420
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:09,459
His speech.

421
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:12,709
He'll sound a little <i>stunad,</i>
probably forever.

422
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:14,417
But get this:

423
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,126
nine months, maybe a year,

424
00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:19,209
till he can work
a full schedule.

425
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:22,625
They'll have to postpone
my retrial.

426
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:24,667
No shit?

427
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,625
The question is,
should I use the stall,

428
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:29,667
but then get a lawyer
who's more with it?

429
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:34,333
So, you heard about
this thing with Phil and John?

430
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:38,749
Bobby said something about this.

431
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,042
That you're
losing money, probably.

432
00:23:41,126 --> 00:23:42,709
I am? How much?

433
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:44,542
I don't know,
you gotta talk to him.

434
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,168
- John?
- Bobby.

435
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,333
Does John do your collections?

436
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:56,459
Look, Uncle Jun',

437
00:23:56,542 --> 00:23:57,959
what do you think?

438
00:23:58,042 --> 00:23:59,417
Phil just beat one of my guys

439
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,709
to within an inch of his life.

440
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:02,542
Next time he's gonna
kill somebody.

441
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,375
What can I do?

442
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:05,792
It's my cousin.

443
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:11,667
Did I give them
the office address or the home?

444
00:24:15,292 --> 00:24:16,375
I'm talking to you.

445
00:24:16,459 --> 00:24:17,709
The man had a stroke.

446
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:19,232
You want it to go
to the wrong place?

447
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,500
It's fruit, it'll rot.

448
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:24,168
Hey. I pinned myself
into a corner here,

449
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,750
and I don't see a way out.

450
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:27,126
But he wasn't made, right?

451
00:24:28,876 --> 00:24:30,959
The kid. Phil's son.

452
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:37,959
It's okay, forget it.

453
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:40,834
I'm sorry, Anthony,

454
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:42,792
but I'm fucking nonplussed
with all this news.

455
00:24:42,876 --> 00:24:44,750
Frankly, I don't know.

456
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:47,667
You're going a little
squirrelly in this house.

457
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,584
Tell Phil.

458
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:50,917
Tell Phil what?

459
00:24:56,459 --> 00:24:57,584
Where you going?

460
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:00,959
You wanted to confer with me?

461
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,042
Nah, it's not important.

462
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:09,001
Make sure you eat a lunch today.

463
00:25:25,584 --> 00:25:26,876
Poor fucking Feech La Manna.

464
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:29,542
Tony sent the wrong ex-con
back to jail.

465
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:31,834
You realize I had
an entire container

466
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:34,459
of imported provolone
coming into that port Saturday?

467
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:37,042
And fucking Phil and them
put it on a truck,

468
00:25:37,126 --> 00:25:38,959
took it to Westchester
instead of Rahway,

469
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:40,322
where we always split the loads.

470
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:42,917
Oh, Jesus.
That shit is liquid gold.

471
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,500
Tony knows what has to be done.

472
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:47,209
Tell John where to find
Tony Blundetto.

473
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:48,542
He just won't do it.

474
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:50,333
As if he even knows
where Tony B. is.

475
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:53,292
Give me a fuckin' break.
Of course he knows.

476
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:54,625
It's Christopher I feel for.

477
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:56,250
Please, huh? Let me
tell you something.

478
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:57,917
Anthony Soprano is very adroit

479
00:25:58,001 --> 00:26:00,667
at keeping his family
out of the fuckin' frying pan.

480
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,876
Both cousins.

481
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:03,542
The rest of us...

482
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:06,834
How's life now
that you're back home?

483
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:14,750
Carmela?

484
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:17,625
I had a dream
a couple of weeks ago.

485
00:26:19,168 --> 00:26:23,168
Before I moved back.
A recurring dream.

486
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,292
I see my old coach
from high school.

487
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,709
What happens?

488
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:29,625
Well, uh...

489
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:35,168
See, he told me back then,
this guy, he said...

490
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:39,250
he said that I was special.

491
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:41,292
You never told me this.

492
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:42,834
Why now?

493
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:45,157
What, does everything I drag
in here gotta be a dead dog?

494
00:26:48,001 --> 00:26:51,292
I went to see my son's
football coach.

495
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:53,792
See, he was starting
my boy and now...

496
00:26:56,084 --> 00:26:57,876
the coach is going
to this other kid more.

497
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:59,917
What's the reason?

498
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:02,584
Well, A.J.'s just devoting
more energy to academics.

499
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:05,325
He's determined
to get into a good school.

500
00:27:09,417 --> 00:27:11,333
How's things on other fronts?

501
00:27:12,876 --> 00:27:14,084
Your cousin?

502
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:21,333
Well, you touched on something
there that's, uh, not so good.

503
00:27:21,417 --> 00:27:22,667
What's the problem?

504
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,459
I really can't talk
to you about it.

505
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,709
This is very difficult for me,
treating you,

506
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:30,750
when so much of your life
is closed off.

507
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:32,625
How many times can I say this?

508
00:27:32,709 --> 00:27:35,168
Look, I'm not trying
to be difficult here.

509
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,917
It's just that it
affects me tremendously,

510
00:27:37,001 --> 00:27:40,168
this trouble he's gotten
himself into, so I'm upset!

511
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:42,625
Well...

512
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:45,250
And I care about him so much.

513
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,417
You care about him so much?

514
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,500
We spent hours
getting to the realization

515
00:27:50,584 --> 00:27:52,459
that your feelings
for your cousin

516
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:54,834
stem from guilt and shame.

517
00:27:54,917 --> 00:27:57,750
Do you remember that?
Do you care?

518
00:27:57,834 --> 00:27:59,959
Yeah, it's just that
it doesn't matter now...

519
00:28:00,042 --> 00:28:02,168
It's just that here we are,

520
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,250
as always, back at square one,

521
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:08,126
with you going into
high-sentimentality mode.

522
00:28:08,209 --> 00:28:09,500
Sentimentality mode?

523
00:28:09,584 --> 00:28:10,917
We were children together!

524
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:14,625
Look, it's a lot like
with your son.

525
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:17,292
Here's what I bet
the coach didn't tell you.

526
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:23,375
What you wanted to hear most
is that your son is special too.

527
00:28:25,876 --> 00:28:28,126
What I'm saying is,

528
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:29,667
whatever you wanna do,

529
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:33,917
vis-à-vis your cousin,
your son, whoever,

530
00:28:34,001 --> 00:28:35,292
own your feelings.

531
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,709
I'm very confused.

532
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:42,001
But...

533
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:44,250
we can't talk about it.

534
00:28:46,209 --> 00:28:47,417
It's my mess.

535
00:28:51,292 --> 00:28:53,250
All my choices were wrong.

536
00:28:57,542 --> 00:28:59,333
- How much?
- It's five bucks.

537
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:04,459
It's five bucks.

538
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:07,084
Your cup's your admission pass.

539
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,959
Where they from?

540
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:16,917
Uh... Montville.

541
00:29:17,001 --> 00:29:18,168
They gotta go.

542
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,417
Totally.

543
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
- Hello?
- Chiara!

544
00:29:22,584 --> 00:29:25,709
No, you gotta come up
Greenbrook Road.

545
00:29:27,417 --> 00:29:30,375
Patrick said to tell you guys,
some people have bogus cups.

546
00:29:30,459 --> 00:29:32,459
They brought them with them
to get out of paying.

547
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:39,168
Hey, man, let me see your cup.

548
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,666
It's back in
the Athletic Department.

549
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:41,959
We're getting ripped off.

550
00:29:42,042 --> 00:29:43,624
You think this is like
downloading music?

551
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:46,168
That beer is our property
unless you pay for it.

552
00:29:48,292 --> 00:29:50,584
Fucking manners!

553
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:04,792
Yeah!

554
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:08,333
Oh, come on.

555
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:35,459
Speak.

556
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:39,834
<i>Hello?</i>

557
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:45,126
<i>Hello?</i>

558
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:48,750
<i>Hello?</i>

559
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:06,292
Who is it?

560
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:07,750
Open this door!

561
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:14,084
Wanna talk to you.

562
00:31:14,168 --> 00:31:16,417
I hear you got some beefs.

563
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,292
You wanna phone everybody?

564
00:31:27,459 --> 00:31:29,084
What the fuck?

565
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:33,001
I know you said
you wanted it burnt, T,

566
00:31:33,084 --> 00:31:35,500
but the picture moved me.

567
00:31:35,584 --> 00:31:38,709
That's 'cause you knew it
cost me a fuckin' arm and a leg.

568
00:31:38,792 --> 00:31:41,209
It's museum-quality work,
I admit that.

569
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:43,417
But I told the guys,
a chance to hang

570
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,792
a picture of you on my wall?

571
00:31:44,876 --> 00:31:46,500
I rescued it from the flames.

572
00:31:46,584 --> 00:31:48,168
What's with the hat and shit?

573
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,500
- Huh?
- Don't give me "huh."

574
00:31:49,584 --> 00:31:51,126
You know what it does to me?

575
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,500
To be reminded
of that fucking horse?

576
00:31:53,584 --> 00:31:55,625
I'm sorry, T.

577
00:31:55,709 --> 00:31:58,126
But you never come here no more.

578
00:31:58,209 --> 00:32:00,001
I didn't figure
there'd be a problem.

579
00:32:04,834 --> 00:32:06,375
I never come here no more

580
00:32:06,459 --> 00:32:09,333
'cause they're watching
all our houses.

581
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:11,250
It's no good for us to visit.

582
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:12,542
I know.

583
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:20,074
What, do you and your whores
get a big laugh out of that?

584
00:32:20,126 --> 00:32:22,250
- That's no joke, T.
- Then what the fuck is it?

585
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:24,500
That's no joke!
That cost me a lot of money

586
00:32:24,584 --> 00:32:25,917
to get the retouching done.

587
00:32:26,001 --> 00:32:27,542
What the fuck you do it for?

588
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:29,417
And don't bullshit me, Paulie.

589
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,001
Part of it, all right, was to fix
some fire damage on the guy's feet.

590
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,750
But while I was at it,
I also thought,

591
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:37,917
I don't have
a modern look in here,

592
00:32:38,001 --> 00:32:41,542
so go with something
more traditional.

593
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:44,126
Something that catches more
of what you're really all about.

594
00:32:44,209 --> 00:32:45,792
A goddamn lawn jockey?

595
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:47,876
That's not a lawn jockey.

596
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:49,792
That's a general.

597
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:53,292
What general? Who?

598
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:55,959
It's not a real general
from history.

599
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:57,792
It's you.

600
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:12,667

Speak.

619
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:11,584
He's at 146, Route 9A,
Kinderhook.

620
00:36:57,209 --> 00:36:58,542
Skip.

621
00:36:58,625 --> 00:36:59,876
How's it going?

622
00:37:01,168 --> 00:37:02,667
- Hey.
- Hey, Ton'.

623
00:37:11,459 --> 00:37:13,709
We got you your bialys
and coffee.

624
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:20,667
Johnny Sack called for you.

625
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,625
Called a couple of times.

626
00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:24,876
He seemed to be upset
about something.

627
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:38,375
Good bialy.

628
00:37:38,459 --> 00:37:40,542
Any time, boss.

629
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:03,917
Catch you later.

630
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,459
Take it easy, Ton'.

631
00:38:24,209 --> 00:38:25,292
What?

632
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:26,709
It didn't solve a thing.

633
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:28,792
- It's over, John.
- The fuck it is!

634
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:30,876
He's beside himself now.

635
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:34,292
The best thing for him,
for you, for all of us,

636
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:37,500
is to put this thing behind us
and get back to business.

637
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:40,584
How the fuck is that
supposed to happen?

638
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:42,584
<i>It's something
we gotta talk about.</i>

639
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:45,126
As a first step,
I'd consider giving Phil

640
00:38:45,209 --> 00:38:47,792
a quarter of my points
in the Bloomfield operation,

641
00:38:47,876 --> 00:38:49,584
which my cousin was running.

642
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:54,375
I'm at Columbia Pres all day,
my yearly physical.

643
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:56,750
<i>An hour already, I'm waiting
for this fuckin' doctor.</i>

644
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,250
<i>Then I got bone density
tests, lipids.</i>

645
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:01,084
Come into the city tonight.
We'll sit down.

646
00:39:01,168 --> 00:39:03,667
No offense, John,
but I got an IQ of 136.

647
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,959
It's been tested.

648
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:09,667
All right.

649
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,625
Tomorrow morning, then.
My house, 6:30.

650
00:39:11,709 --> 00:39:14,084
- What?
<i>- I'm on a 9:00 a.m. flight to Miami.</i>

651
00:39:14,168 --> 00:39:16,667
- I have to get things in line down there.
- John...

652
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,333
You think I'm gonna
give you <i>ammazz'</i>

653
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:19,750
<i>with Ginny upstairs?</i>

654
00:39:24,084 --> 00:39:25,916
All right, if you don't hear
from me, I'll be there.

655
00:39:25,917 --> 00:39:28,084
Tony, you and you alone.

656
00:39:28,168 --> 00:39:31,001
I'm not having Phil, nobody.

657
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:38,542
Who is it?

658
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:40,084
It's me.

659
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:03,001
You need to go up to the farm
and pick up your cousin.

660
00:40:06,584 --> 00:40:09,333
I need you to go up there now,
this morning.

661
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:12,250
It may be over,
but watch your back.

662
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,042
Take him off the premises,
obviously.

663
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:20,042
He should be buried.

664
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:23,500
It should be you
that does it.

665
00:40:24,876 --> 00:40:26,084
You got it.

666
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:36,333
We never got a chance to talk
in detail about Adriana.

667
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:38,959
I know.

668
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:54,084
If you let something slip...

669
00:40:55,834 --> 00:40:57,292
if she saw anything...

670
00:40:58,459 --> 00:40:59,917
There was a couple of times

671
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:02,500
I had her with me
picking up collections.

672
00:41:02,584 --> 00:41:03,876
Esplanade.

673
00:41:07,209 --> 00:41:08,292
The cigarettes.

674
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:10,042
She was always nosing around.

675
00:41:13,292 --> 00:41:15,959
Did you ever say anything about
Ralph or the Bevelaqua kid?

676
00:41:16,042 --> 00:41:17,250
No.

677
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:20,084
- Would you remember?
- I swear on my life.

678
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:38,168
You won't find any of that.

679
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,959
I'm reading,
I'm lifting weights.

680
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,375
I know what you think,
Ton', but you'll see.

681
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:47,209
I'm gonna prove myself to you.

682
00:41:47,292 --> 00:41:50,375
I only chipped that once,
on the day with her.

683
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:00,667
She was willing to rat me out

684
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:03,584
because she couldn't do
five fuckin' years?

685
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:06,168
- I thought she loved me.
- She's a cunt.

686
00:42:07,876 --> 00:42:09,917
Does no good to think
about that now.

687
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:17,667
All right, so...

688
00:42:20,084 --> 00:42:21,292
Come on.

689
00:42:37,917 --> 00:42:39,876
He does like her.

690
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:41,250
Because he told me.

691
00:42:44,709 --> 00:42:47,168
I have heard you talking
in here all night.

692
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,624
- Could you knock?
- You said you would be

693
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:50,745
finishing your application
for East Stroudsburg State.

694
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,292
You're gonna stroke
out if you can't find

695
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:54,499
a way to control yourself about all this.

696
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,834
I know.

697
00:42:55,917 --> 00:42:57,126
Hang that phone up.

698
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:00,333
Call me back later?

699
00:43:02,584 --> 00:43:05,001
I don't know what to say,
you know?

700
00:43:05,084 --> 00:43:07,001
If those applications are late,
you are cooked.

701
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,959
It's that simple.
And I do know this,

702
00:43:09,042 --> 00:43:11,126
because I have raised you
from day one,

703
00:43:11,209 --> 00:43:13,250
you are not gonna like
working at McDonald's.

704
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:14,750
Could you amp up
the drama a little?

705
00:43:14,834 --> 00:43:17,126
You know what?
I don't like the sarcasm.

706
00:43:17,209 --> 00:43:19,126
And I don't want you around here

707
00:43:19,209 --> 00:43:21,375
next year sponging
off of us, so fine.

708
00:43:21,459 --> 00:43:22,750
I am withholding all allowance

709
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:24,250
until those applications
are done.

710
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:26,917
That's not even practical
and you know it.

711
00:43:27,001 --> 00:43:28,417
What's the matter?

712
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,333
He hasn't done his applications.

713
00:43:30,417 --> 00:43:31,917
He isn't getting allowance.

714
00:43:32,001 --> 00:43:33,084
No allowance.

715
00:43:33,168 --> 00:43:34,959
Well, I have $300
of my own money.

716
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:36,375
How?

717
00:43:36,459 --> 00:43:38,209
Me and Matt put on a party.

718
00:43:38,292 --> 00:43:39,834
Five dollars a person.

719
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:42,168
We made 600 bucks
after expenses.

720
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,959
- What expenses?
- The band.

721
00:43:44,042 --> 00:43:46,323
Is that what you've been on
the phone about for two weeks?

722
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:49,042
It may interest you to know

723
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,459
people said it was
the best party all year.

724
00:43:51,542 --> 00:43:52,942
Well, there was drinking,
I suppose?

725
00:43:53,001 --> 00:43:54,625
We just let people
into Matt's house.

726
00:43:54,709 --> 00:43:57,126
What they brought with them
was not under our control.

727
00:43:58,709 --> 00:44:00,333
Do your applications.

728
00:44:00,417 --> 00:44:01,584
Now.

729
00:44:13,834 --> 00:44:15,168
What?

730
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:17,168
You know, it's interesting.

731
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:20,001
I was talking
to his college advisor.

732
00:44:20,084 --> 00:44:21,459
Who, Wegman?

733
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:23,126
No. A.J. got switched around.

734
00:44:23,209 --> 00:44:24,292
Miss Merrow.

735
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:27,917
She mentioned that A.J.
talked to her once

736
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:31,959
about what might be good schools
to study event planning.

737
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:34,750
Event planning?

738
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,250
What the hell is it?

739
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:44,584
I am not really sure.

740
00:44:48,542 --> 00:44:49,750
Gay, isn't it?

741
00:44:50,876 --> 00:44:52,209
I don't know.

742
00:44:52,292 --> 00:44:54,667
I know you're around
a lot of wealthy people.

743
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,042
Well...

744
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:58,542
And then he watches that DVD
over and over again.

745
00:44:58,625 --> 00:45:00,459
The one with Mike Myers about...

746
00:45:00,542 --> 00:45:03,709
What's his name?
Steve Rubell, the Studio 54 guy?

747
00:45:03,792 --> 00:45:05,834
Oh, Jesus.

748
00:45:12,542 --> 00:45:14,834
Yeah, but I mean,
you know, it...

749
00:45:19,792 --> 00:45:21,792
Well, I guess, you know...

750
00:45:22,917 --> 00:45:24,126
I don't know.

751
00:45:25,876 --> 00:45:28,250
He's fired up
about something, at least.

752
00:46:05,168 --> 00:46:07,084
So? Go ahead.

753
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:10,917
Phil has to know that
punishment has been meted out,

754
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:12,584
and that's all there is.

755
00:46:12,667 --> 00:46:15,168
And that what
we are here for, in the end,

756
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:18,709
is to put food
on the table for our families,

757
00:46:18,792 --> 00:46:22,084
our sons, the future.

758
00:46:22,168 --> 00:46:23,917
That's what's important.

759
00:46:24,001 --> 00:46:27,459
He doesn't accept that.
His family's smaller by one.

760
00:46:27,542 --> 00:46:28,917
Well, then, my friend,

761
00:46:29,001 --> 00:46:30,667
it's up to you
to make him accept it.

762
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,417
- Me?
- Let's talk, John,

763
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,834
about the 500-pound elephant in the room,

764
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,459
which is that you started
this cycle of bloodshed

765
00:46:37,542 --> 00:46:40,042
when you whacked the girl
Carmine used to fuck.

766
00:46:40,126 --> 00:46:42,500
Lorraine Calluzzo
was not a girl,

767
00:46:42,584 --> 00:46:45,001
and what kind of a man
bangs his second cousin?

768
00:46:45,084 --> 00:46:46,834
What are you,
the frigging cardinal?

769
00:46:48,209 --> 00:46:51,959
Look, you wanna shut down
our joint construction jobs?

770
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:53,792
Eat K-rations? Fine.

771
00:46:53,876 --> 00:46:55,709
You want Phil to put one
in one of my guys?

772
00:46:55,792 --> 00:46:57,952
That's gonna go a long way
to making you the rich prick

773
00:46:57,959 --> 00:47:00,084
that you always wanted to be.

774
00:47:00,168 --> 00:47:01,250
What do you suggest?

775
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:03,500
Whatever his legitimate sorrow,

776
00:47:03,584 --> 00:47:04,750
he's got a price.

777
00:47:04,834 --> 00:47:06,959
He wants to provide
for his family.

778
00:47:07,042 --> 00:47:09,917
- And?
- And what?

779
00:47:10,001 --> 00:47:12,084
Meet his price, and that's it.

780
00:47:12,168 --> 00:47:13,448
I don't wanna hear nothing else.

781
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,834
Oh, you don't?

782
00:47:14,917 --> 00:47:16,584
I've paid enough, John.

783
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:18,959
I've paid a lot.

784
00:47:30,209 --> 00:47:31,750
Maybe I could sell it.

785
00:47:33,001 --> 00:47:34,667
Truth is, we've had discussions.

786
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,209
I gave him the sports book.

787
00:47:36,292 --> 00:47:38,834
Why didn't you say that
right off, you cheap fuck?

788
00:47:38,917 --> 00:47:40,292
Because I don't like it.

789
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:42,041
He's gonna want consigliere,
or who knows what?

790
00:47:42,042 --> 00:47:43,625
All right,
let's not go backwards now.

791
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:52,959
These people you run
into who wanna be boss, huh?

792
00:47:53,042 --> 00:47:54,250
They should know.

793
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:57,126
I told you.
You don't listen, you nut.

794
00:48:01,584 --> 00:48:02,876
It's good...

795
00:48:02,959 --> 00:48:04,250
seeing you again.

796
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:06,876
I still look forward
to working with you, John.

797
00:48:06,959 --> 00:48:09,333
- I mean that.
- You want a coffee?

798
00:48:09,417 --> 00:48:11,168
Oh, I don't know.

799
00:48:16,917 --> 00:48:19,126
Oh, my fucking Christ!

800
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,668
FBI! Open up!

801
00:48:41,876 --> 00:48:44,625
Oh, my God!

802
00:48:54,209 --> 00:48:56,917
I'm the gardener. I'm the--ah!

803
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,625
Absolutely, put him on.

804
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:07,792
Anthony?

805
00:50:07,876 --> 00:50:10,459
The feds just hit Johnny Sack.

806
00:50:10,542 --> 00:50:11,917
You heard anything?

807
00:50:12,001 --> 00:50:14,834
I had Gendler on my cell phone
all the way over here.

808
00:50:14,917 --> 00:50:16,959
<i>Jimmy Petrille was a cooperator.</i>

809
00:50:17,042 --> 00:50:18,084
Brooklyn AUSA took down

810
00:50:18,168 --> 00:50:20,001
the whole Petrille crew,
plus Johnny.

811
00:50:20,084 --> 00:50:21,917
<i>Would've reached all the way
to Carmine Senior</i>

812
00:50:22,001 --> 00:50:23,250
<i>if he hadn't died.</i>

813
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:24,876
Jimmy Petrille?

814
00:50:24,959 --> 00:50:26,333
He's a sweet old guy.

815
00:50:26,417 --> 00:50:29,042
<i>He gave them gambling,
homicides, trafficking.</i>

816
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:30,500
Eighteen fucking years' worth.

817
00:50:30,584 --> 00:50:32,959
It's a major <i>kreplach,</i>
my friend.

818
00:50:33,042 --> 00:50:34,459
I was fucking there.

819
00:50:34,542 --> 00:50:36,625
- What? Where?
<i>- Johnny's house.</i>

820
00:50:36,709 --> 00:50:38,126
My car's still in the driveway.

821
00:50:38,209 --> 00:50:39,959
<i>I'm walking three miles
towards my house.</i>

822
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:41,625
No law against parking your car,

823
00:50:41,709 --> 00:50:43,442
unless it's
in front of a hydrant.

824
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,292
I'm not laughing, Neil.

825
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:48,750
No, of course not.

826
00:50:48,834 --> 00:50:51,541
Anyway, you weren't named in
the indictment,

827
00:50:51,565 --> 00:50:55,542
<i>obviously. It's Brooklyn.
They weren't coming for you.</i>

828
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:57,375
So, frankly, were I you,

829
00:50:57,459 --> 00:50:59,876
<i>I might actually
consider laughing.</i>

830
00:50:59,959 --> 00:51:02,709
Or rub a hunchback's hump.
Or something.

831
00:51:05,209 --> 00:51:06,459
Yeah.

832
00:51:06,542 --> 00:51:08,333
Be of good cheer.

833
00:51:08,417 --> 00:51:10,168
