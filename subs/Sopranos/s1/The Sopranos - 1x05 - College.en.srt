1
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:56,749
How'd it go?
They got a 48- to- 52
male- female ratio,

2
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,751
which is great,

3
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,754
strong liberal arts program
and this cool
olin arts center for music.

4
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:04,257
Usual programs abroad
are china, india--

5
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,759
you're just applyin' here.
Already you're leavin'?

6
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,762
It's an option, dad.
Junior year.

7
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:13,766
What do you study
in india? How not
to get diarrhea?

8
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:17,270
They don't require sat scores,
but mine will help
'cause they're high.

9
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,272
Socially, i don't know.

10
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,274
This one girl told me
there's a saying:

11
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:24,277
"Bates is the world's
most expensive form
of contraception."
Hey.

12
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:28,781
What kind of talk is that?
The girls at the other colleges
we been to, they just put out?

13
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,668
Oh, my god.

14
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,172
It's pretty, huh?

15
00:02:36,673 --> 00:02:38,675
Yeah.

16
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:41,044
Two to go.
Colby up.

17
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:45,048
Dad, how come
you didn't finish college?

18
00:02:45,048 --> 00:02:48,551
Well, i had that
semester and a half
at seton hall.

19
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:50,553
Yeah, and?

20
00:02:51,554 --> 00:02:54,057
Your grandma and grandpa
didn't stress college.

21
00:02:54,057 --> 00:02:56,192
They were
working- class people.

22
00:02:56,192 --> 00:02:58,695
How come your parents
were anti- education?

23
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:02,815
They weren't anti.
You can't lay it
all off on them.

24
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,819
I got into
a little trouble
when i was a kid.

25
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,821
I heard.
Mm- hmm.
You did?

26
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,457
While in waterville,
dine at the stone house,

27
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:14,460
serving the freshest
maine lobster since 1840.

28
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,963
Come see our new salad bar,
featuring a wonderful--

29
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,979
are you
in the mafia?

30
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,232
- Am i in the what?
- Whatever you wanna call it.
Organized crime.

31
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:40,853
That's total crap.
Who told you that?

32
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,855
Dad, i've lived in the house
all my life.

33
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,359
I've seen police come with
warrants. I've seen you going
out at 3:00 in the morning.

34
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:50,363
You never seen doc cusamano
go out at 3:00 in the morning
on a call?

35
00:03:50,613 --> 00:03:53,116
Did the cusamano kids ever find
$50, 000 in krugerrands...

36
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:56,119
and a. 45 automatic while they
were hunting for easter eggs?

37
00:03:56,119 --> 00:04:00,123
I'm in the waste management
business. Everybody immediately
assumes you're mobbed- up.

38
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:02,625
It's a stereotype,
and it's offensive.

39
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,128
And you're the last person
i would want to perpetuate it.

40
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:08,131
Fine.

41
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:11,634
There is no mafia.

42
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:23,279
All right, look.

43
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,282
Med, you're a grown woman,
almost.

44
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:31,287
Some of my money...

45
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:34,290
comes from illegal gambling
and wha-- and whatnot.

46
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,549
How does that make you feel?

47
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:47,053
At least you don't keep
denying it, like mom.

48
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,555
Kids in school think
it's actually kind of neat.

49
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:52,175
- They seen
the godfather, right?
- Not really. Casinowe like.

50
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:54,177
Sharon stone,
'70s clothes, pills.

51
00:04:54,677 --> 00:04:57,814
I'm not askin' about those bums.
I'm askin' about you.

52
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:01,067
Sometimes i wish
you were like other dads.

53
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,570
Then, like mr. Scangarelo,
for example.

54
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,573
An advertising executive
for big tobacco.

55
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,827
Or lawyers? Ugh.
So many dads are full of shit.

56
00:05:10,827 --> 00:05:13,830
- And i'm not?
- You finally told
the truth about this.

57
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:24,590
Look, med,
part of my income comes
from legitimate businesses.

58
00:05:24,707 --> 00:05:26,959
- Stock market, i--
- look, dad, please. Okay?

59
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,462
Don't start
mealy- mouthing.

60
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,970
How's my sweetheart?

61
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,973
I'm so pissed
i can hardly see.

62
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:45,111
- Why? You gettin' the flu?
- No, it's my cousin, svetlana.

63
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:48,231
- The amputee?
- Two months
she's only in america,

64
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:50,233
and she's already
getting married.

65
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,986
You knew the deal. I got
two kids high school age.
We talked about this.

66
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,622
Yes, and a wife
whenever you want.

67
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,624
What do i have in my life?

68
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:03,246
- Boy, am i glad i called.
- Fuck you, then! Hang up!

69
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:05,381
How are the whirlpool jets?
They get'em in right?

70
00:06:05,381 --> 00:06:09,001
Don't throw up in my face
things you buy me, okay?

71
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:12,388
Her prosthetic leg
fell off in a gap store,

72
00:06:12,388 --> 00:06:15,391
and he carries her out
like a knight...

73
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:17,894
in white satin armor.

74
00:06:18,394 --> 00:06:21,397
I gotta go.
Uh, my daughter's comin'.

75
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:25,768
Jesus.

76
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,911
Yeah. How ya feelin'?

77
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:37,914
Oh, better, actually.
Fever just broke.

78
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:39,916
I miss you two.

79
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,418
How's the interviews
going?
Good.

80
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:45,037
Real good.
Oh, yeah?
Did she like bates?

81
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,541
Anything to get her
off of this berkeley kick.

82
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,543
What the fuck?

83
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,680
Tony?

84
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,683
Yeah, yeah.
Look, i'll call you back
from the motel.

85
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:16,319
Meadow! Come on!

86
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,214
Come on.
Get in.
Okay, okay!
What's the rush?

87
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,219
Geez, dad!

88
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:43,095
- What's going on?
- I think i saw
an old friend, that's all.

89
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:47,099
- You know that guy
at the gas station?
- Maybe not.

90
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,485
- Probably not.
- Then what?

91
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,104
Dad, slow down!

92
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,995
Dad, jesus,
what's with you?

93
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,746
- It's all right.
-
fucking maniac!

94
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,749
- What's going on? -

95
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,868
just foolin' around.

96
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:12,875
Dad-- colby. Turn.

97
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:15,378
Colby. Turn left.
It's to the left!

98
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:17,513
Left!

99
00:08:17,513 --> 00:08:20,016
Dad!

100
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:22,018
See? That's'cause you're
talkin' to me so much.

101
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:31,894
Hey, this gets us
toward colby anyhow.

102
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,034
Dad, that's our motel.

103
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:40,653
Hello. Our motel's
right there.

104
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:49,045
- Do you know that guy?
- Nah. It wasn't him.

105
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:02,425
Bada- bing.

106
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:05,928
- Take this number down
and call me back.
- Now? It's pourin' down here.

107
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:08,431
207- 555- 0185.

108
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:13,569
Mmm. Bonjour.

109
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:16,072
Room service
et arrivee.

110
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:18,074
Oop.

111
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:23,079
Why, thank you,
kind sir.

112
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,586
- What? You said
poached eggs. -

113
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:34,590
you're not gonna eat'em now,
after all that work.

114
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:38,094
I guess my eyes
were bigger
than my stomach.

115
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:48,604
Anthony, why don't you
go over to jason's,
play nintendo?

116
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:53,859
Nope. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No kisses. Cooties.

117
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,861
I'll be back
in, like, an hour.

118
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:57,980
Okay.

119
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:12,628
Oh, motherfucker.

120
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,632
A real fuckin' shit.

121
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:23,506
Hey. I'm not sure,
but i think i just saw
fabian petrulio.

122
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:26,008
Refresh my memory.
Was he before your time?

123
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:30,012
Made guy. Flipped about
ten years ago when he
got busted for peddlin' "h."

124
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:33,649
Rat fuck
took out a lot of people,
a lot of people from our outfit.

125
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:36,652
My old man was sick.
He never recovered
when he heard the news.

126
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:39,655
- You saw this guy?
- That's what i'm sayin'.

127
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:43,159
- I think i did,
but i'm not sure.
- Up in maine? What the fuck?

128
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,661
He went into
the witness protection program.
Then they kicked him out.

129
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:48,664
Now he goes to colleges and
gets paid all kinds of money...

130
00:10:48,664 --> 00:10:50,666
to talk about what
a big, bad mafioso he was.

131
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,169
- Piece of shit.
- Febbie and me partied
a couple of times,

132
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:55,171
but jackie aprile
knew him good.

133
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:57,173
They did a couple of counts
together up in lewisburg.

134
00:10:57,173 --> 00:11:00,176
You know that bust that was
in his rec room of sinatra?

135
00:11:00,176 --> 00:11:02,678
Febbie made it for him
in a prison workshop.

136
00:11:02,678 --> 00:11:06,048
That was frank, that bust?
I always thought
it was shaquille.

137
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:09,051
Fucker needs to practice
a little on lips.

138
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:12,304
Yeah, i know. Anyway,
run these plates for me.

139
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,308
Go ahead.
Maine,

140
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:19,945
d- x- 6- 6- 9- 2- 0.
Call you back tonight
at 10:00. all right?

141
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,951
Hey.
What's wrong
with the phone in your room?

142
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,955
Nothin'. Takin' a walk,
saw the phone. Figured i'd
give christopher a call.

143
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:32,458
Oh, yeah?
Everything okay?
Yeah.

144
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,461
Yeah. They got a leak
in the roof, though.
Is that all right?

145
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,963
Uh- huh.
Huh?

146
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,303
Who is it?
Father phil.

147
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,305
Just a second.

148
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,808
Oh, jesus.

149
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:14,450
Oh, my god.
Look at you!

150
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,952
Oy!
I hope i'm not
barging in.

151
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:18,954
Oh, no, i was,
uh, watching tv.

152
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:20,956
Oh. I was over
at the clothing drive,

153
00:12:20,956 --> 00:12:22,958
and i thought
you were up in maine.

154
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,461
Oh.
By the way,
your marchino
pedal pusher suit,

155
00:12:25,461 --> 00:12:27,463
it just
flew out of there.

156
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:29,465
Oh, good, good, good.

157
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:31,467
So anyway, jean cusamano
said you were ill.

158
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:34,470
Yes, i was. The flu
that was going around?

159
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,474
Yipes.
Yeah. I still have
a little fever, but, uh--

160
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:40,976
i also have
a confession
to make, carm.

161
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:43,479
Uh--

162
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:47,983
i- i have a jones
for your baked ziti.

163
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:50,986
Oh.
Sure. Any time.

164
00:12:50,986 --> 00:12:52,988
I have some in the freezer.
I can reheat it.

165
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:56,492
It's so much better that way,
isn't it? The mozzarella
gets all nice and chewy.

166
00:12:56,492 --> 00:12:58,994
I like that too.
I was having
a little fernet.
Yeah.

167
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:02,998
- Settles the system.
Would you like something?
- Some wine, if it's open.

168
00:13:02,998 --> 00:13:06,502
Mm- hmm.
So, how's med and
tony's trip going?

169
00:13:06,502 --> 00:13:11,390
I should know? He doesn't have
time to talk to me for two
lousy minutes.
Oh, geez.

170
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,398
Dad, stop staring.
Why are you doing that?

171
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,902
It's an exciting time.

172
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:27,907
I can't tell you
how proud i am of you.
A real student at casa soprano.

173
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,910
And she looks like
one of the models right out
of italianvogue.

174
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,413
Italian, italian, italian.
Thank you.

175
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,917
You're definitely
up to something.

176
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,419
Oof! How'd you get
so cynical?

177
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:49,178
That stuff
we talked about before.

178
00:13:49,178 --> 00:13:53,182
- How's that sittin' with you?
- Like i wasn't 90% sure
already.

179
00:13:53,182 --> 00:13:56,685
- What about your brother?
Does he know?
- I think so.

180
00:13:58,187 --> 00:14:00,189
There was a time
when the italian people...

181
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:03,192
didn't have
a lot of options.

182
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:06,195
You mean like mario cuomo?

183
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:09,198
Sorry.

184
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,202
You know, i put food
on the table.

185
00:14:13,202 --> 00:14:16,205
My father was in it.
My uncle was in it.

186
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:19,208
Maybe i was too lazy
to think for myself--

187
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:23,212
consider myself a...rebel.

188
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:26,715
Maybe being a rebel in my family
would have been sellin'
patio furniture on route 22.

189
00:14:29,718 --> 00:14:32,221
In college,
nothing interested you?

190
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:35,224
Nah, i barely got in.

191
00:14:35,224 --> 00:14:38,227
Well,
kind of liked history.

192
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:40,229
Yeah?
Yeah.

193
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:42,731
Napoleon,
the roman empire.

194
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:45,234
The potsdam conference--
that kind of thing.

195
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:48,737
- What's the potsdam conference?
- Pots- damned if i know now.

196
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:50,739
Oh, my god.

197
00:14:55,744 --> 00:14:58,747
Dad, i have something
to tell you.

198
00:14:58,747 --> 00:15:00,749
Yeah?

199
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:06,755
- You're not--
- no! Jesus!

200
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:15,264
A couple of weeks ago,
me and some friends,
we were doing speed.

201
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:18,267
- We did kind of a lot
of it for a while.
- You what?

202
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:20,769
It was just between
homework and sats...

203
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,772
and just general
pressure of life.

204
00:15:23,772 --> 00:15:26,275
- We needed something
to keep going.
- That crap'll kill you.

205
00:15:26,275 --> 00:15:29,278
- I know.
- I oughta slap the shit outta
you. Where did you get it?

206
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:32,781
If i thought
this was gonna be a lecture,
i never would have told you.

207
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:36,785
Take a reality check. What do
you think i'm gonna say?
Where did you get it?

208
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:40,289
No way i'm telling you,
especially after this reaction.

209
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:43,292
Why did you tell me?

210
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:48,297
You were honest with me today.
I won't be doing it again.
It got too scary.

211
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:51,300
Jesus, right under my nose.

212
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:54,803
You think you'd know.

213
00:15:54,803 --> 00:15:56,805
No, dad, you won't.

214
00:16:03,812 --> 00:16:06,815
I'm glad you told me,
in spite of everything.

215
00:16:07,816 --> 00:16:09,818
I'm glad i did too.

216
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:11,820
I'm glad we have
that kind of relationship.

217
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:22,197
Tony hates
building fires.

218
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:24,199
We have
this beautiful fireplace,
and those same three logs...

219
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,201
have been in there
since lincoln split them.

220
00:16:26,702 --> 00:16:29,705
Fear of fire.
Good deterrent
to keep out of hell.

221
00:16:29,705 --> 00:16:33,208
Maybe there is hope for him.

222
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:36,095
Oh. I got something for you.

223
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,097
That's what
we were talking about.

224
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,599
The chapter on buddhism
is spectacular,

225
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,102
but i don't want you going
over to those zany zennies.

226
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:47,606
Fat chance. It's funny.
I could never just sit on
the floor and think of nothing.

227
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,109
- Thank you.
- Sure.

228
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:54,613
You'll see how islam
has gotten a bad rap
in current culture, and--

229
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,984
boy, this chianti, though,
is beyond reproach.

230
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,236
- Word up.
-

231
00:17:05,874 --> 00:17:08,744
dad.
Thought you fell in.

232
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:13,248
This is carrie
and lucinda.
How ya doin'?

233
00:17:13,248 --> 00:17:16,251
- They go to colby.
- Yeah? Why don't you
hang out with them?

234
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:19,755
- Dad.
- What better way to learn
about the college?

235
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:22,257
Yeah, maybe, but--

236
00:17:22,257 --> 00:17:25,260
no, no,
that'd be cool.
Please excuse him.

237
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,763
No, really.
We love to dish
the school.

238
00:17:28,263 --> 00:17:30,265
- Well--
- go ahead.

239
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:32,768
Okay.
Now, med,
no drinkin'.

240
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:35,771
Girls, you see
that she sticks
to cokes.

241
00:17:35,771 --> 00:17:39,274
I'll come back for you
in an hour and a half.
Be good.

242
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,783
Yo.
What do you got?

243
00:17:47,783 --> 00:17:49,785
- Wet shoes.
- You chose this life.

244
00:17:50,285 --> 00:17:52,287
You don't want
to work in the rain,
try out for the yankees.

245
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:54,790
The car is registered
to fredrick peters,

246
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,793
38 washington street,
waterville, maine.

247
00:17:57,793 --> 00:18:00,796
It's off route 201.
I looked it up.

248
00:18:00,796 --> 00:18:04,800
Fredrick peters.
Fabian petrulio.
Good match, huh?

249
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,687
I guess. I don't know.
T, what are you gonna do?

250
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,190
I don't know.

251
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,193
I got meadow here.
Jesus.

252
00:18:14,443 --> 00:18:17,696
Fuckin' nightmare. You want,
i'll fly up and take care of it.

253
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,699
You're a good kid.
You stay put.

254
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:23,702
- Maybe call pussy or paulie.
- What, they can do it,
but i can't?

255
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:27,206
Don't be sensitive. They had
a friend, jimmy, die in prison
on account of this scumbag.

256
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:31,710
- All right, i'll let'em know.
- Fuck, i gotta do my homework
and positively i. D. This guy.

257
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,714
- I thought you said it was him.
- I haven't seen him in
12 years. I gotta make sure.

258
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:38,717
All right, i'll call you
around midnight. Sit tight.

259
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,727
You think
i'm a schnorrer,
don't you?

260
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:51,730
A who?
Yiddish.

261
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,234
It means somebody
who always shows up
in time for free grub.

262
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,736
Well, you're here a lot.

263
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,239
And you're a man.
You like to eat.

264
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,743
I can't get over you
with that yiddish.

265
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:07,746
Oh, that's, uh--
my neighborhood
in yonkers was mixed.

266
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,748
Jewish and italian,
you know?

267
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,750
Eh, a heady brew.

268
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,752
What does that mean,
"heady"?

269
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,255
Mmm. Melting pot.

270
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,757
Some vigor.
Oh.

271
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:26,765
Hello.
Hello.
I'm calling for tony soprano.

272
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,768
Cajun stuffed olives?
Who can i say
is calling?

273
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,272
- This is dr. Melfi.
- His nurse?

274
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,275
No. Is--
is this mrs. Soprano?

275
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,277
Uh, that's right.
And you are again?

276
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,279
Jennifer melfi.
Dr. Melfi?

277
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,282
Jennifer.
Lovely name.

278
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:48,787
No, he's not home.
Could i impose
on you to, uh,

279
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:51,790
to tell him that
i need to reschedule
monday's appointment.

280
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,793
- I'm down with the flu.
- Does he have your number?

281
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:59,298
- Let me give it to you in case.
- I lost my pencil, up his ass.

282
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,300
I'll tell him
you called.

283
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,810
Why does he have to lie?

284
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,314
Why couldn't he tell me
his therapist is a woman?
What is he hiding?

285
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,817
- Maybe he did tell you, and you
didn't hear him clearly.
- Oh, please.

286
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:22,321
Here's your fernet.
Why wouldn't he tell me,
unless he's screwing her.

287
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,823
Carmela, please.

288
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,326
And i thought
he was changing.

289
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:31,330
I thought therapy was gonna
clear up the fuckin' freak show
in his head.

290
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,334
Carmela. I'm sure
you're wrong about them.

291
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,836
Therapy is a start.

292
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:41,340
It's a good start,
but, yes, it doesn't
fix the soul.

293
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,843
He's gonna need help
from other sources
to repair that.

294
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,346
Well, then you
talk to him.
You help him.

295
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,348
But, well,
there you go.

296
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,850
W- will he listen?

297
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,973
He must be
a very unhappy man.
He's unhappy!

298
00:20:57,973 --> 00:21:00,475
Sleep is my number one--
aw, shit.

299
00:21:02,477 --> 00:21:04,980
Why go into it?

300
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:25,417
Good thing
it's full of air bubbles.

301
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,421
- Mommy?
- Yes, bear?

302
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,424
Would you put me to bed?
I'm scared.

303
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:35,427
- Sure, honey. Hold on.
- I thought
she was sleeping.

304
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,930
Yeah, well, she woke up.
Daddy's gonna come too,
sweetie.

305
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,316
We'll both
put you to bed.

306
00:21:41,316 --> 00:21:44,936
Hurry, daddy.
Yeah, yeah.

307
00:22:18,053 --> 00:22:21,056
These red pepper flakes
really make all the difference.

308
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:23,058
Mm. Spicy.

309
00:22:23,058 --> 00:22:25,060
Good as willem dafoe was,

310
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,063
i cannot picture
that jesus looked like him.

311
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:30,949
Could you
pass the cheese?

312
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,951
Not that he didn't do
a good job, willem dafoe,

313
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,953
but the story's
confusing.

314
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,456
So he gets down
offthe cross?

315
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,958
Mm.

316
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,461
You know, originally,
bobby d. Was supposed
to have that role?

317
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,963
Really?
Oof.
Mm- hmm.

318
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,466
- Different picture.
- Oh, totally.

319
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,970
You talkin' to me, pilate?

320
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:57,342
You must be talkin' to me,
'cause i don't see nobody else
here, except barabbas here.

321
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,344
You know
what's remarkable?

322
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,347
If you take everything
jesus ever said,

323
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:04,850
add it up, it only amounts
to two hours of talk.

324
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,352
No.
Mm- hmm.

325
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:10,355
No, but wait.
I heard the same thing
about the beatles.

326
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:13,859
Except it was
if you add up all their songs,
it only comes to ten hours.

327
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,864
Yes.

328
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,369
Of course, it wasn't
just what christ said.
It was his deeds.

329
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,872
See, that's my question.

330
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:30,876
I understand what he did,
but a lot of what he said,
i don't get.

331
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:34,379
Like,"the sun rises on the just
and the unjust alike"?

332
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:38,884
Why?
Because. Christ was
saying that we're all--

333
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:41,636
that whores will go to heaven
before a lot of the righteous?

334
00:23:41,636 --> 00:23:43,638
Uh- huh.
That's
not right.

335
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:47,142
Let's face it, father.
We got some major
contradictions here.

336
00:23:49,144 --> 00:23:52,647
- It's about love.
Think about it like that.
- What does that mean?

337
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:57,152
It means,
hopefully, someday,

338
00:23:57,152 --> 00:23:59,654
we will learn to tolerate,

339
00:24:00,155 --> 00:24:03,158
accept and forgive
those that are different.

340
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,047
Change through love.

341
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,057
Well.

342
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,676
Well-- oh, man,
i better get going.

343
00:24:21,676 --> 00:24:23,812
Where you going?
You just got here.

344
00:24:24,312 --> 00:24:25,814
It's getting late.

345
00:24:26,314 --> 00:24:28,316
But it's pourin' rain out.

346
00:24:28,316 --> 00:24:31,820
And i know
you love that dvd player.
I gotremains of the day.

347
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:34,940
Hmm.
See?
Do i know you?

348
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,443
Anything with
emma thompson, i'm there.

349
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,579
Father phil,
i didn't know you looked.

350
00:24:40,695 --> 00:24:42,697
What?

351
00:24:42,697 --> 00:24:46,201
To take in through the eyes
a beautiful woman?

352
00:24:46,201 --> 00:24:50,705
Is that so different
than a sunset, a douglas fir,

353
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:53,458
or any of god's
handiwork?

354
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,645
Hey, fred.
Hey, tanky.
What do you say?

355
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,147
You gonna give away
any homemade cheese
this year?

356
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:52,150
For what they get
for cream, i don't know.

357
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,152
Listen, tank,
anybody been lookin'
for me...

358
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,154
or askin'
any questions
about me?

359
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:59,157
Big guy.
New york sounding?
Is there a problem?

360
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:04,663
No, no. Nah, dipshit
hit me with his boat while
i was tubin' on caribou lake.

361
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,666
Claims it was
my fault.

362
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:10,168
If he shows up,
you want me
to give you a call?

363
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,671
Yeah, i wouldn't mind.
Do that. Thanks.

364
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,181
You ready?
Yeah. Let's go.

365
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,104
No one was asking
for you, fred.

366
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,106
All right, vitus.
Thanks.

367
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,620
Hello, rat.

368
00:28:44,906 --> 00:28:47,409
Please leave me alone,
miss kenton.

369
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:49,911
Why won't you
show me your book?

370
00:28:49,911 --> 00:28:52,914
This is my private time.
You're invading it.

371
00:28:52,914 --> 00:28:54,916
Oh, is that so?
Yes.

372
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:58,420
I'm invading
your private time, am i?
Yes.

373
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:02,791
What's in that book?
Come on. Let me see.

374
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:06,795
Or are you protecting me?
Is that what you're doing?

375
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,048
Would i be shocked?

376
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,552
Would it ruin
my character?

377
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,056
Let me see it.

378
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:41,463
Father, turn it off.
I can't handle it.

379
00:29:42,464 --> 00:29:44,466
What?

380
00:29:44,966 --> 00:29:47,469
What is it?
Oh, father,
i'm a terrible person.

381
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:49,471
Oh, no.

382
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:53,475
You're a wonderful woman.

383
00:29:53,475 --> 00:29:56,978
Oh, it's been
building in me.
I need to get it out.

384
00:29:56,978 --> 00:29:59,981
There's so much in me,
i wanna-- i wanna--

385
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:02,484
carmela,
if i can help.

386
00:30:02,484 --> 00:30:04,486
Please.

387
00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:09,491
How?

388
00:30:15,497 --> 00:30:17,999
How long has it been
since you last confessed?

389
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,003
Uh-- uh--
i, uh--

390
00:30:23,004 --> 00:30:25,006
if you like,
i can do this with you.

391
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:29,511
You mean right here,
father? Now?

392
00:30:29,511 --> 00:30:32,514
The whole world
is god's house.

393
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,516
He hears and sees
everything.

394
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:02,544
Forgive me, father,
for i have sinned.

395
00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:06,548
It has been four weeks
since my last confess--

396
00:31:06,548 --> 00:31:10,552
what am i
talkin' about?
That's a lie.

397
00:31:10,552 --> 00:31:13,555
I haven't
truly confessed
in tw- twenty years.

398
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:19,310
Go on.

399
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,313
I have forsaken...

400
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:28,319
what is right...
for what is easy,

401
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:35,326
allowing what
i know is evil
in my house;

402
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,831
allowing my children--

403
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:42,834
oh, my god,
my sweet children--
to be a part of it...

404
00:31:43,785 --> 00:31:45,787
because i
wanted things
for them.

405
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,173
Wanted a better life,
good schools.

406
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:52,176
I wanted this house.

407
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:56,180
Wanted money in my hands--
money to buy anything
i ever wanted.

408
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,300
I'm so ashamed.

409
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:09,811
My husband.

410
00:32:11,312 --> 00:32:14,816
I think he has committed
hor- horrible acts.

411
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,705
I think he has-- you know
all about him, father phil.

412
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:23,708
I'm the same.
I've said nothing.
I've done nothing about it.

413
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,712
I got a bad feeling.

414
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:32,717
It's just a matter of time
before god compensates me...

415
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,720
with outrage
for my sins.

416
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,105
All right, come on.

417
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:59,110
Oh, tequila breath.

418
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,112
Whew!
Sorry, dad.

419
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,614
It's all right, kiddo.
Just hang onto me.

420
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,616
Don't throw up
on that dress,

421
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,618
or i'll have to tell
your mother everything.

422
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:10,121
This guy was giving me
tequila shooters.

423
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:16,627
Oh-- oh, god,
everything is spinning.

424
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,597
You're not mad,
are you, daddy?

425
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:21,599
Little bit.
Where are the keys?

426
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,469
- I gave them to you.
-

427
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:27,221
i love you, dad.
- I know.

428
00:33:38,232 --> 00:33:40,651
You must
truly repent,

429
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:43,021
genuinely
and honestly.

430
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,742
And in the future,
you must renounce
all these actions,

431
00:33:47,742 --> 00:33:49,627
and then god
will absolve you.

432
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,633
I don't know, father.
I'll try.

433
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,637
But i still love him.

434
00:34:01,089 --> 00:34:03,091
I still believe
he can be a good man.

435
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:06,978
Then you help change him
into a better man,

436
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,981
and then you will have
done good in god's eyes.

437
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,154
I think you should
take communion.

438
00:34:17,405 --> 00:34:19,657
Yeah.

439
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,674
Why do you
have that with you?

440
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:39,677
Unfortunately i had
to say mass for someone
in intensive care.

441
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:49,937
Lord, i am not worthy
to receive thee.

442
00:34:49,937 --> 00:34:51,939
But just say the word,

443
00:34:51,939 --> 00:34:54,442
and i will be healed.
And i will
be healed.

444
00:35:14,462 --> 00:35:16,831
This is
the body of christ.

445
00:35:16,831 --> 00:35:18,833
It was broken
for you.

446
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:34,599
This is
the blood of christ.

447
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,567
It was shed for you.

448
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:03,461
Accept the spirit of christ,
our lord and savior.

449
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,463
Amen.

450
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:08,466
In the name of the father,
the son and the holy spirit.

451
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,470
Amen.

452
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:33,241
Dad?

453
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:36,244
I booked a seat on
a boston flight, tomorrow, 4:00.

454
00:36:36,244 --> 00:36:39,247
- Best i could get.
- Don't come.

455
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:42,250
I'll make sure you
and meadow clear the state
before anything happens.

456
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,752
We don't ever meet
face to face.
This is my thing.

457
00:36:44,752 --> 00:36:49,390
I am your soldier, antonio.
This is my duty, like we're
always talkin' about.

458
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:52,894
The way this went down,
this is my call.

459
00:36:52,894 --> 00:36:54,896
I gotta vouch
for this myself.

460
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:58,399
Clippin' a famous rat
would put me a cunt hair away
from bein' made.

461
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:00,902
He might have recognized me
at the gas station.
He could lam anytime.

462
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:06,908
You stay put.
End of discussion.

463
00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:11,913
Why are you using
the pay phone again?

464
00:37:12,413 --> 00:37:14,415
These walls are
like paper. I didn't
want to wake you up.

465
00:37:14,415 --> 00:37:17,418
Dad, please don't lie
to me.
Let's go back
to bed.

466
00:37:17,418 --> 00:37:19,420
Lying down
made me throw up.

467
00:37:48,816 --> 00:37:50,818
Hello.

468
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:53,821
Oh, hi, honey.

469
00:37:55,323 --> 00:37:57,325
Oh, yeah.
Was it fun?

470
00:37:58,826 --> 00:38:00,828
Oh, good.

471
00:38:03,831 --> 00:38:06,334
Oh, you-- you wanna
sleep over there?

472
00:38:09,837 --> 00:38:12,340
Okay. Love you.

473
00:38:35,863 --> 00:38:38,366
That was a. J.

474
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:41,369
He's sleepin' over.
Oh, i see.

475
00:38:44,872 --> 00:38:47,375
He's at
a friend's house.

476
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:49,877
Oh.

477
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,882
The pucillos.
I don't know
if you know them.

478
00:38:56,884 --> 00:38:58,886
No, i--

479
00:39:00,888 --> 00:39:03,391
oh.

480
00:39:04,392 --> 00:39:07,395
Oh-- oh, i--
what?

481
00:39:07,395 --> 00:39:10,031
Oh!
Are you all right?

482
00:39:22,543 --> 00:39:24,045
Father phil?

483
00:39:24,545 --> 00:39:26,547
Are you
all right?

484
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,656
Hello.

485
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,159
Hello?

486
00:40:32,613 --> 00:40:34,615
Ow! Don't!

487
00:40:36,617 --> 00:40:39,620
Wanna stop and get
a beer? Huh?

488
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,489
No?

489
00:41:28,035 --> 00:41:30,671
I'll pick you up
in a little while.
You knock'em dead.

490
00:41:30,671 --> 00:41:33,874
- Aren't you coming in?
- No, i left my watch
at the motel.

491
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:36,377
I'll catch up
to you later.

492
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:39,513
Grab me a student paper.

493
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,562
You should have
some coffee.

494
00:42:32,566 --> 00:42:34,568
Last night--
yep.

495
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:39,073
We didn't
do anything
out of line?

496
00:42:39,073 --> 00:42:41,575
There's nothing
to apologize about.

497
00:42:43,577 --> 00:42:45,579
Right.
That's right.

498
00:42:48,082 --> 00:42:52,086
I should
get dressed,
get goin'.

499
00:42:52,086 --> 00:42:54,088
Anthony junior
will be home soon.

500
00:42:54,088 --> 00:42:58,592
Oh, my god. My car's
been out there all night
in plain sight.

501
00:42:58,592 --> 00:43:01,095
If we didn't do anything wrong,
we didn't do anything wrong.

502
00:43:01,595 --> 00:43:03,597
Is there a commandment
against eating ziti?

503
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,102
It's okay.
Take a shower,
get dressed.

504
00:43:08,102 --> 00:43:11,105
Don't forget
your sacrament kit,
whatever.

505
00:43:12,606 --> 00:43:15,609
I'm home!

506
00:43:20,614 --> 00:43:22,866
Carmela.

507
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,870
I don't know
where to begin.

508
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:34,878
It's-- it's not
that i don't have desire
for you in my heart.

509
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:37,381
Marrone, father, please.
But last night...

510
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:40,384
was one of
the most difficult tests
from god ever for me.

511
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:42,886
What are you
talkin' about?
We're friends.

512
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:48,392
What's that look about?
What, i look some way?

513
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:57,267
I was just thinkin'
about when we watched
casablancalast week.

514
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:00,270
That new print
is great, huh?

515
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:03,273
You know when bogie says,

516
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:06,777
"of all the lousy gin joints
in the world, why'd she
have to pick mine?"

517
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,781
Of all thefinukpriests
in the world,

518
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:13,283
why did i have to get
the one who's straight?

519
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:17,421
Carmela--

520
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:19,923
come on. It's a joke.

521
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:44,448
I would have done it
myself last night,
but some people came along.

522
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:47,951
But anyway,
it's a gray town car, new model.

523
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:50,454
You pick'em up
on the colby campus.
Stay on'em.

524
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,456
Where on
the colby campus?

525
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:55,459
What'd i just say?
His kid's applyin'.
The fuckin' admissions office.

526
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:57,961
Oh. Okay.
You follow'em.

527
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:00,330
An hour outta town,
you pull up alongside--

528
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,332
- boom! Twelve- gauge.
- Fuck that.

529
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:06,837
Do what i ask,
or you'll never get
another bag off me.

530
00:45:10,724 --> 00:45:14,595
No, no. Fuck that.
Fuck that!

531
00:45:14,595 --> 00:45:17,598
You want the cops
to find out who burnt down
the historical house?

532
00:45:17,598 --> 00:45:20,601
Fuck you,
fuck- wad!

533
00:45:20,601 --> 00:45:23,604
We were volunteer firemen
together, asshole! I know!

534
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:36,366
Yeah, is dougy in?

535
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,116
Good mornin', rat.
Who are you?
What is this?

536
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:36,370
Don't make me laugh.
You pimp! You fuck!

537
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:40,374
- Teddy, there must be
something we can do--
- tony. It's tony, you fuck.

538
00:47:40,374 --> 00:47:44,378
You know how much trouble
you're in now? You took
an oath, and you broke it!

539
00:47:44,378 --> 00:47:47,381
I could've
killed you last night,
outside the motel.

540
00:47:47,381 --> 00:47:50,884
Your daughter was drunk,
remember? I was there
in the parking lot.

541
00:47:50,884 --> 00:47:52,886
I had a gun,
but i didn't do it.

542
00:47:52,886 --> 00:47:55,505
Because of her,
i told myself,
"it's just a coincidence.

543
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:58,508
He's takin'
his little girl to college."

544
00:47:58,759 --> 00:48:01,762
One thing about us wiseguys,
the hustle never ends.

545
00:48:02,262 --> 00:48:04,765
You shot me at that motel,
your life would've been
flushed down thepiscia- do!

546
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:06,650
Please, tony, i'm begging!

547
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:12,272
Jimmy says hello
from hell, you fuck!

548
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:47,451
Where have you been?
I went back
to the motel,

549
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:49,453
they didn't have the watch.

550
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:52,956
So i went to the restaurant.
They was closed. I had
to wait for them to open.

551
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:56,843
Restaurant had your watch?
I took it off in the bathroom
when i was washing my hands.

552
00:49:57,844 --> 00:50:00,714
You ready?
Don't wanna be late
for bowdoin.

553
00:50:15,395 --> 00:50:18,148
Dad, what's up with that?

554
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,652
Oh, uh,
the restaurant.

555
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:26,656
I tried the back door.
There were puddles.

556
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,162
It was dumb.
I know.

557
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:41,671
Your hand is bleeding.
Dad, where did you go?
You saw that man, didn't you?

558
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:45,675
I cut it on a screen door.
What man?

559
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:48,562
The man you said
you didn't know.

560
00:50:48,562 --> 00:50:50,564
Ah, va a napoli.
What do you think
happened?

561
00:50:50,564 --> 00:50:53,066
I don't know.
You got in a fight?
You don't know.

562
00:50:53,066 --> 00:50:55,569
You're makin'
a big deal outta this,
and you don't know.

563
00:50:55,569 --> 00:50:58,071
You were on the pay phone
again last night
at 1:00 in the morning.

564
00:50:58,071 --> 00:51:01,074
I was on the pay phone
at 1:00 in the morning?

565
00:51:01,074 --> 00:51:03,076
Excuse me,
miss cuervo anejo.

566
00:51:03,076 --> 00:51:07,581
You can't be trusted to remember
what happened last night, 'cause
you were seeing pink elephants.

567
00:51:08,081 --> 00:51:10,200
I warned you not to drink.

568
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:18,208
Dad, you're being honest
with me, right?

569
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:21,962
Pretty soon here
you're gonna start
hurtin' my feelings.

570
00:51:21,962 --> 00:51:25,348
- We have that kind
of relationship, you said.
- That's right.

571
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:29,352
We do or we don't.
Takes two to tango.

572
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:33,857
- Dad--
- what?

573
00:51:39,479 --> 00:51:41,481
Nothing.

574
00:51:49,489 --> 00:51:51,491
I love you.

575
00:51:51,491 --> 00:51:53,994
I love you too.

576
00:51:59,499 --> 00:52:01,001
Where's my paper?

577
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,253
I forgot.
She forgot.

578
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,262
Miss soprano,
come on in.

579
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:18,902
Shall we talk
about your future?

580
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:11,288
Oh, here they are,
the two ivy leaguers.

581
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:13,790
Mwah! How was it?
Do you's want something to eat?

582
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,792
It was good.
I gotta call hunter.

583
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:18,295
Hey.

584
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:21,298
Gee, she spared me
no boring detail.

585
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:24,301
I'll be back.
What a trip.

586
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:27,304
I'm beat.
What, new england?
It's so gorgeous.

587
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:31,808
Hmm. You still sound
a little nasal,
but you look better.

588
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:35,178
Any cold pasta?
There was some ziti,
but it all got eaten.

589
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:39,683
The whole tray?
From last sunday?

590
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:43,603
Monsignor jughead was here.

591
00:53:43,603 --> 00:53:46,606
If you are referring
to father intintola,
yes, he was.

592
00:53:46,606 --> 00:53:48,608
Hmm.

593
00:53:48,608 --> 00:53:51,611
He spent
the night here.
Yeah, right.

594
00:53:52,612 --> 00:53:54,614
Okay.

595
00:53:57,117 --> 00:54:00,620
- The priest spent the night
here. What happened?
- Nothing.

596
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:04,507
- Where was anthony?
- He was sleeping over
at jason's.

597
00:54:04,624 --> 00:54:07,127
The priest spent the night here,

598
00:54:07,127 --> 00:54:10,130
nothin' happened, and you're
tellin' me this because--

599
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:15,018
you might hear something,
take it the wrong way.
His car was out front all night.

600
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:19,522
You know what?
This is too fucked up
for me even to think about.

601
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:28,531
What'd you guys do
for 12 hours? Play,
uh,"name that pope"?

602
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:32,535
He gave me
communion.

603
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:35,288
- Oh, i'll bet
he gave you communion.
- Excuse me?

604
00:54:35,288 --> 00:54:39,292
The guy spends the night
here with you, and all
he does is slip you a wafer?

605
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:41,795
That's verging on sacrilege.

606
00:54:41,795 --> 00:54:44,164
- Oh, i didn't mean to verge.
- You think i'm lying?

607
00:54:44,297 --> 00:54:46,800
I don't know,
but the whole thing sounds--

608
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,302
would i have told you about it
voluntarily if there had been
anything to be ashamed of?

609
00:54:49,302 --> 00:54:52,305
Do i look like
the friggin' thornbird
over here?

610
00:54:52,305 --> 00:54:55,308
He's a fag. That's it.

611
00:54:55,308 --> 00:54:57,811
'Cause otherwise,
i gotta question
what i'm hearin' here.

612
00:54:59,312 --> 00:55:01,815
Oh, tony, you are a sketch.

613
00:55:05,318 --> 00:55:08,321
Oh, by the way,
your therapist called.

614
00:55:09,322 --> 00:55:12,826
Jennifer?

615
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:17,947
Carm.

616
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,950
I just thought you'd
think it was weird...

617
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:23,203
if i saw a woman psychiatrist,
that's all.

618
00:55:24,704 --> 00:55:28,708
Carm, come on!
It's just therapy, that's all.
We just talk!
