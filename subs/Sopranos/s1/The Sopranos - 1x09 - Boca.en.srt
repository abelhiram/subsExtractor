1
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:11,177
You woke up this morning

2
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:14,647
got yourself a gun

3
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:18,034
your mama always said
you'd be the chosen one

4
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:21,538
she said
you're one in a million

5
00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:24,541
you've got to burn
to shine

6
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,543
but you were
born under a bad sign

7
00:00:26,543 --> 00:00:30,046
with a blue moon
in your eyes

8
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:32,048
when you woke up
this mornin'

9
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,051
all that love had gone

10
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:39,806
your papa never told you
about right and wrong

11
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:43,059
but you're, but you're
looking good, baby

12
00:00:43,426 --> 00:00:45,562
i believe that
you're a- feelin' fine

13
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:48,314
shame about it
born under a bad sign

14
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:52,435
with a blue moon in your eyes
so sing it now

15
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:57,574
woke up this morning
you got a blue moon
got a blue moon in your eyes?
?

16
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,826
Yeah

17
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,697
you say you
woke up this morning

18
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,200
the world turned
upside down

19
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,335
lord above, things ain't
been the same

20
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:13,206
since the blues
walked into town

21
00:01:13,456 --> 00:01:17,210
but you're, but you're
one in a million'cause you
got that shotgun shine

22
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,097
shame about it
born under a bad sign

23
00:01:21,097 --> 00:01:24,851
with a blue moon
in your eyes, yeah

24
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:27,854
woke up this morning

25
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,356
got yourself a gun

26
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:32,859
got yourself a gun

27
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:35,478
got yourself a gun

28
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,484
come on. Come on, dog.
Come on, come on, come on.

29
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:43,987
Come on, come on, come on.

30
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:45,989
Go get it.
Look at this.

31
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:49,993
Look at this plastic.
And there's weeds.

32
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:52,495
It looks like
tobacco road.

33
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:55,131
Nobody gets down here.
Anthony!

34
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:58,134
Those dogs are wild dogs.

35
00:01:58,134 --> 00:02:02,138
Cemetery dogs.
They'll take your hand off.

36
00:02:02,138 --> 00:02:04,140
Come over here.

37
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,644
Say a hail mary
for your grandfather.
Lay off. He's a kid.

38
00:02:07,644 --> 00:02:12,015
So he should
neglect his elders?
Just like his father.

39
00:02:12,015 --> 00:02:15,018
Yeah, real scamp.
Yeah, my son,

40
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:17,020
the mental patient.

41
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,022
Remember those trips
to the shore?

42
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,274
Me and tony used to
ride the waves?

43
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:25,778
- I taught him how to bodysurf.
- My son was brought up right.

44
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,281
He needs a psychiatrist
for what?

45
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,783
To talk about his sex life?
Enough.

46
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:33,786
I hate it
as much as you do.
Anthony!

47
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:37,290
Those dogs could start
foaming at the mouth.

48
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:41,177
Hey, grandma. How come
youse not supposed to
breathe in the cemetery?

49
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,180
Who says?
It's a joke, for christ's sake.
Say "why?"

50
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,683
'Cause you'll make
the dead people jealous.

51
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,806
Pick it up! Pick it up!
Who's got the ball?

52
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,693
- Who's got the ball?
- Oh, my god.
Meadow, look out!

53
00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:59,562
Come around, come around!

54
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:01,564
Up, up, up!
Cover'em through!

55
00:03:02,065 --> 00:03:04,200
- I can't watch.
- Yes!

56
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,953
- Atta girl, meadow!

57
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,955
You're a brick wall, baby!
Brick wall!

58
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,958
Good save! Come on, now!
Come on!

59
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:14,077
That was close.

60
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:17,580
Pretty good.
Look at you
at girl's soccer, tony.

61
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,583
What do you want from me?
My only son's a couch potato.

62
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:23,219
- Red, five!
- What are you,
yellow card happy?

63
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,837
Rough play, my ass!

64
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,473
Oh, come on!

65
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,593
Hi, honey.
Got get'em, baby.

66
00:03:30,593 --> 00:03:34,097
This fat kid is such a sneak
with that elbow!

67
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:37,600
Coach says next year
chiara is gonna be
one of his stars.

68
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,603
Come on, falcons! Let's
pull it out, for christ sake!
Heather dante!

69
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:45,858
- A hundred bucks for a goal!
- What's with ally today?
She's sleepwalkin' out there.

70
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:50,496
She eats at our house
three nights a week.
I know she's got the energy.

71
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:54,000
That tackle was all ball,
asshole!

72
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,253
Yeah, zebra,
i'm talkin' to you!

73
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,372
You blow that whistle
one more time, i'm gonna
stick it up your fuckin' ass!

74
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:03,876
Get off the field! Now!
Get off the field or your team
is gonna forfeit the game!

75
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:07,880
I'm goin'.
You fuckin' son of a--
get off the field!

76
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,386
You're a hell of a guy.

77
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,641
Falcons!
Falcons, heads up!

78
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:23,029
Red 42, 42! Push!

79
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:26,399
Ally! Come on.

80
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,404
Come on, al!

81
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,424
Yes, yes, yes!

82
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,430
Did i tell you?
Did i tell you?

83
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,933
He's a brilliant coach.
He's a beautiful,
brilliant genius.

84
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,936
Yeah. You in love
with him or what?
Frankly, yes.

85
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:07,440
If he steers chiara through
to a college scholarship,
i'll blow the guy at midfield.

86
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,693
Oh, you will?

87
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:13,196
How's cheffing at dimples?

88
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:16,199
You gotta come sample
the salad bar. We got
a special chemical brightener.

89
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,201
Keeps the lettuce crisp.
How nice.

90
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:20,703
Oh, yeah.
It's beautiful.
The offer's still there.

91
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:23,206
You wanna make a little money,
you put some out on the street,

92
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:25,708
at two points,
we split the interest.

93
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,211
Nice.

94
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:32,715
I can't do the math,
ton'. I'm an artiste.

95
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:35,718
Get outta here.

96
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:37,720
Good job, girls!

97
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,983
Absolutely, yeah.
You do that so well, coach.

98
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:54,987
Thank you.
You did a hell of a job,
coach.

99
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,123
Welcome to the bada bing.
Everything's on the house.

100
00:05:57,123 --> 00:06:00,126
Brandy! Come here!
I want you to meet somebody.

101
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,128
- This guy coached college.
- Get outta here.

102
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:06,132
Division 1- a!
Nay, that's boonie state.

103
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:09,635
Besides, art, the time
has come to stop moving
my wife and deena...

104
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,637
like pawns every time
somebody ups the ante.

105
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:16,142
Anyway, now many chances
does a man get to coach
his own daughter?

106
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,644
What do they say?
"Money isn't everything."
Hear, hear.

107
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,647
- It's the kids
that are important.
- Cheers to the falcons.

108
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,649
Continued success.

109
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:31,657
Brandy, why don't you give
the coach a deluxe tour
of the vip lounge?

110
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:35,161
What?
Oh, guys.

111
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,663
Jesus,
we said a beer.

112
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:42,168
Oh, whoa-- no, i--
uh, thank you, but
i don't think so.

113
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,671
Aw, jesus christ.

114
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:49,675
Okay, brandy, go, uh,
sit on a tuffet.

115
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,178
Coach,
it's on the house.

116
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,799
- What the fuck are you
doin' here?
- Who's he?

117
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:58,801
My girl's soccer coach.
You got somethin' for me?

118
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:01,804
For one thing, every car you see
in your rearview mirror
is not a fed.

119
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:04,807
Mikey palmice went out
and got a major manhattan p. I.

120
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:07,810
Mikey palmice thinks
someone here is rattin'
for the government.

121
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,313
What else is new?
What else?

122
00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:13,816
My colleague over at
organized crime task force...

123
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:18,321
gets chatty after, uh,
caffeine drinks.

124
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:22,825
Names of people
whose fiscal interests
intersect with your own.

125
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:26,329
Shit.
I'm still trying to find out
if you've been named.

126
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:30,833
But these people, they are
keeping these indictments
very, very internal, tony.

127
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,336
For all i know, they got
a folder withmyname on it,

128
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:35,338
and if i was smart,
i wouldn't be here.

129
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:39,225
I rest my case.
As it is, i'm up the street
on a rape/homicide.

130
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:43,229
What i need now, is to see
a liquor license, sir,
if you don't mind.

131
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:47,233
So anybody wonders
why i was here, or
for the lie detector test--

132
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:52,738
cha- cha, show him
the liquor license.
Don't touch the girls.

133
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,241
How you doin'?

134
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,243
Bada bing. Arthur bucco!

135
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,245
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

136
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,868
- Hello?
- What, you gonna stay
in that bar all day?

137
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:09,005
I'm shootin'
a little pool.
I'll rack'em up for you.

138
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:12,008
I thought we were supposed
to be painting the trim
on the patio.

139
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:14,510
I bought the primer
and i've been scraping.

140
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:18,130
- You have.
- Arthur, i could really
use your help.

141
00:08:18,514 --> 00:08:20,766
All right. Sure.
Honey, i'll be right home.

142
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,639
This fuckin' guy lays down
the law, ton'.

143
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,141
Fuckin' blisterin'.
I'll be right home, honey.

144
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:32,144
I've gotta be
getting home too.
Shelly'll be looking for me.

145
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,647
It's quite the lifestyle
you got here, though.

146
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,649
See you later,
coach.
Okay.

147
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,151
Different strokes.

148
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,789
Melvoin, frolov, schneider
and archide.

149
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,791
I'm sorry.
He's in a meeting.
Can i take a message?

150
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,793
What's goin' on with the feds
and their fuckin' indictment?

151
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,296
Just put it
right down there.

152
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:54,300
Here's the bill.
The book is off
from the 14th ward.

153
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:57,303
I don't wanna minimize
your position, corrado.

154
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,306
Two prior convictions.
That places you in jeopardy
of sentence...

155
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,308
under the
habitual offenders statute.

156
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,678
I'm payin' you four an hour
to hear shit that's already
eatin' my insides?

157
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,180
Who had the peppers
and eggs?
Over here.

158
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:10,566
That's what i should've had.

159
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:18,074
I'd be happy
to surrender mr. Soprano?

160
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:21,077
You can be assured
of my full cooperation?

161
00:09:21,577 --> 00:09:24,447
You'd rather they kicked in
your front door
in the middle of the night?

162
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,949
It's a target letter,
corrado.

163
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:30,202
I wasn't getting anywhere,
so i asked them point blank
what your status was.

164
00:09:31,954 --> 00:09:34,590
Just testing. That's what
a good lawyer would do.

165
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,210
- They'd let me know
when it was appropriate.
- I may just start paying taxes.

166
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:40,596
- Fuckin' funny. -

167
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:43,349
i'm sick and tired
of sittin' around here
on my hands.

168
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,851
I'm gonna get outta here.
Down to boca
with your lady friend?

169
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:50,222
- What the fuck you know?
- Works for the joint fitters
union, didn't somebody say?

170
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:54,610
Runs their, uh,
labor management fund
outside the fed's oversight.

171
00:09:56,612 --> 00:09:59,615
If you can't get
your friends jobs, what's the
purpose of attaining success?

172
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:02,118
The wheels of justice
turn slowly.

173
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,371
Take her to florida.
Develop a tan.

174
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:09,625
- Where's the key
to the partners' crapper?
- Top right- hand drawer.

175
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:13,629
Junior, we're working out of
our fuckin' lawyer's office.

176
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:15,631
Is that right?

177
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:19,635
I didn't want to say anything,
but this government's case?

178
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:22,138
If there's a leak,
it's in tony's boat.

179
00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:24,640
You wanna tell me...

180
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,643
my nephew's in bed with
the justice department,
just say it.

181
00:10:27,643 --> 00:10:29,645
Don't stammer around
like a fuckin' spastic.

182
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:32,148
There's something
fucking wrong with that guy.

183
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:36,652
I feel it in my gut.
I'm worried about you,
skipper.

184
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:40,156
I'm sorry, mikey.
You're a good boy.

185
00:10:40,656 --> 00:10:42,608
Fuck this.
I'm goin' to boca.

186
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:46,829
Deena, when you guys showed up
to verbum dei last year,

187
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:49,332
i thought,"soccer.
Give me a break."

188
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:53,836
But your dad makes it seem
like this, i don't know,
metaphor.

189
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:55,838
Yeah.
Yeah, dad's pretty cool.

190
00:10:55,838 --> 00:10:58,841
You guys, where's al?
She was supposed to
loan me a cig.

191
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:01,344
I'll come with.

192
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:03,846
Al?
Ally!

193
00:11:05,348 --> 00:11:07,850
Al!

194
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:12,355
If you're smoking,
you owe me five dollars!

195
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:14,357
Al?
Ally?

196
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,229
Ally?

197
00:11:20,229 --> 00:11:23,232
- Ally, what are you doing?
- Ally!

198
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:25,368
Oh, my god! Ally!
Ally! Oh, my god!

199
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:32,625
Her parents split up.
That's why she spends
all her time at our house.

200
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,627
But the kid was born
with a silver spoon.

201
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,129
Teenage girls are
under a lot of stress.

202
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,132
I know this kid.
She's great.

203
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:44,637
Was it a genuine
suicide attempt, or was
it a suicidal gesture?

204
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,140
"Small cutting"
is the clinical term.

205
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,142
What's "large cutting"?
O. J. In the missing tracksuit?

206
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,145
It's a cry for help.

207
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,147
Ah.

208
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:59,151
Her mother says she...
tried this before.

209
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:02,655
A couple times.

210
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,157
What else is going on
in your life?

211
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:07,276
Life is putting
the prozac to the test.

212
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,662
It's all that business that
keeps popping up in the news?

213
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,665
I'd rather talk about
my daughter.

214
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,167
Principal says girls in sports,
they do better.

215
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,671
They don't take the drugs,
they don't get knocked up.

216
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,673
But now this shit.

217
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,676
If my daughter ever tried
to kill herself--

218
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,048
oh, god!

219
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,559
Last week
i called you a whore.

220
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,063
I might've been...

221
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,565
overstatin' the case
a little bit.

222
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,207
Oo- hoo.
Mr. Soprano.

223
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:58,577
Miss sanfillipo.
I have a check here
for you to sign.

224
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:03,082
Twenty grand.
For research
and development...

225
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,468
into furthering
the art and science...

226
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:08,471
of metal and ceramic
joint fitting.

227
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,723
Where does our research
and development
take us this time?

228
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,225
I was thinking
boca raton.

229
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,979
My, my.
You read my mind.
I'm all packed, baby.

230
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:19,098
I gotta talk to my cousin.

231
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:22,101
Uh, mr. Soprano?
What?

232
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:26,105
I was waitin' to talk to jerry
about how i could use some, uh,
wiggle room...

233
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,741
on this mall job i got
in north bergen.

234
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,493
Then i saw you here.
And i thought,

235
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:34,497
"what the hell?
I may as well
ask the man himself."

236
00:13:34,497 --> 00:13:36,499
Let's you and i meet.

237
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:39,001
I can pass my recommends
onto my cousin.

238
00:13:42,505 --> 00:13:46,509
Hey, mama livia, how are you?
Do you remember me,
larry boy barese?

239
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:49,011
Well, i know
who you are!

240
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:53,015
You lit an apartment house
on fire...

241
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:55,518
and scared your mother
half to death.

242
00:13:56,018 --> 00:13:58,637
Mama's moving in here
on the fifteenth.

243
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,140
I like your shoes,
larry boy.

244
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,894
Mama hasn't been well in
her mind. Last week she threw
a jar of artichokes at me.

245
00:14:05,394 --> 00:14:07,897
She better not throw
any artichokes at me!

246
00:14:07,897 --> 00:14:10,399
Ma, how you doin'?

247
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,902
- Remember larry?
- Water under the bridge.

248
00:14:12,902 --> 00:14:15,404
Yeah. We're gonna take a walk.
We'll be right back.

249
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:17,406
You should get some shoes
like his.

250
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:21,410
I'll tell you somethin',
tony. You've always been
a fuckin' genius.

251
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,913
But this last move is
the best move you ever did.

252
00:14:23,913 --> 00:14:26,415
The feds are never gonna
surveil an old folks home.

253
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:30,419
That's why i got six truckloads
of bootleg polident comin' in.

254
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:32,421
Hey, jimmy.
How you doin'?
There he is.

255
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:34,807
Did you get your mother
settled into a suite?

256
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,809
They're not sure they're
gonna accept her.

257
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,811
They wanna see my
financial statement again.

258
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,814
So this office supply chain
comin' up from virginia.

259
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,066
What's the deal on them?
I spoke to them.

260
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:47,570
I think they're gonna listen
to reason on minority hiring.

261
00:14:49,438 --> 00:14:52,074
You been to games?
What've they got?

262
00:15:02,952 --> 00:15:04,954
What the fuck?

263
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:09,842
Hup! Hup! Hup!
Hup! Hup!

264
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:13,345
Knees high, colgiavani!
Eyes ahead!

265
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,347
Energy, girls, energy!

266
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:19,852
I know we're all upset about
all that's been going on, but
we still have a season left!

267
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,354
Come on!
Let's go!
Hey, coach.

268
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,857
Hey, fellas. Uh, sorry,
but practice is closed today.

269
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,860
I'm trying to
keep the team focused.
What're you doin'?

270
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:33,232
You're leavin' us?
After two fuckin' years?

271
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:36,735
I told that reporter
to wait until after sectionals
before he put that in the paper.

272
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:40,623
Coach, look at my little girl
out there.

273
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:46,745
- You're breakin' her heart!
- Believe me, art.
I am hugely conflicted.

274
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,747
But rhode island
doubled my salary!

275
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:52,751
They're giving my daughter
a full ride!
What could i do?

276
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:57,006
- They made me an offer
i couldn't refuse.
- You haven't heard ours.

277
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,391
Come on, sil.
Look, buddy,
i got a family too.

278
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,394
I happen to have a daughter
who loves playing soccer
very much.

279
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:05,898
Just kiddin'
about the offer thing.

280
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,400
Hey, nobody blew a whistle!

281
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,403
Let's not get lazy
out here! Come on!

282
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:15,157
- Why don't you
go fuck yourself?
- Excuse me?

283
00:16:15,157 --> 00:16:17,776
Hey, med, want me
to tell your father--
this is my field.

284
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,915
Why don't you give me
ten laps around the goals!

285
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:24,667
Whatever.
Make that 20.

286
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,786
Anybody else
wanna mouth off?

287
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,791
Good! Come on!
Let's circle up
for keep- away!

288
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:35,544
Let's go! Over here!
Get in a big circle!

289
00:16:35,544 --> 00:16:37,680
Go! Come on! Move it!

290
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,682
Out here!
I need some people out here!

291
00:16:39,682 --> 00:16:41,934
Come on! Let's go!

292
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,448
Gimme your glass.

293
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,453
Who would've ever thought
we could've been
this contented?

294
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:05,958
I did. As soon
as i saw you, i knew.

295
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,460
You're a sweetheart.

296
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,464
If only they knew
the other side of you.

297
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,467
They'd eat me
for breakfast.
Mmm.

298
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,971
I've been lookin'
at some real estate.
Some nice houses on the market.

299
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,473
Maybe you'd like
something bigger.

300
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,977
No, corrado.
This is our place.

301
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:28,981
You know how long
we been comin' here?
Sixteen years.

302
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,983
And every one of them good.

303
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:36,989
How's junior, junior?
Hmm?

304
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,491
He's catching some shuteye.

305
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:43,495
Oh. You're such
a powerhouse.

306
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,498
When you kiss me
down there,

307
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:50,002
you're like
a great artist.

308
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:53,005
You got a real instinct
for it.

309
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,508
Pass me the red peppers.

310
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,022
You know the thrill
you give?

311
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:15,527
Just keep it to yourself,
okay, roberta?
Yeah.

312
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,529
All to myself.

313
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,541
Corrado?
Yeah?

314
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,543
Why the big secret?

315
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:35,547
About what?
Oral sex.

316
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:39,551
What's so terrible
about pleasing a woman?

317
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:46,058
You always have to
talk about everything.
I wanna know why!

318
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,061
It's complicated.
Yeah.

319
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:53,065
But why?
Why?

320
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,068
Because they think
if you'll suck pussy,
you'll suck anything.

321
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:59,071
Oh, you're kidding.
It's a sign of weakness.

322
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:03,575
And possibly a sign
that you're afinocch'.

323
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:07,579
A fag?
That's ridiculous.

324
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,583
How would the two
even translate?

325
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:17,089
What are you gonna do?
I mean, i don't make the rules.

326
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:22,678
Hey, it's not big
lifestyle choice, shylockin'.

327
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:25,180
My aunts quintima
and gemma.

328
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,433
They got money out
earnin' on the street.
It's like bein' a banker.

329
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,936
You help people.

330
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,941
Chiara broke down in tears
when she heard the coach
was leaving.

331
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,443
You don't wanna
talk about it, fine.
No, i--

332
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:43,448
i gotta go pick up
carmela at her sister's.
Let me ask you a question.

333
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,451
Why does your wife hate me?
Charmaine doesn't hate you.

334
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,956
Yeah.

335
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:53,959
You lie
like i play the french horn.
What?

336
00:19:55,961 --> 00:20:00,465
Look at the fuckin'faccim
over here. Wearing a cap
in a nice restaurant like this.

337
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,971
That's one of the things
i hated most when i had
my restaurant.

338
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:10,475
It's values today.
Standards are crumbling.

339
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:15,981
Would it have killed
this coach to stick around
until my kid graduates?

340
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,483
Then let him stay four years
for chiara.

341
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,987
Hi.

342
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,240
That burns my ass.

343
00:20:27,242 --> 00:20:29,244
Where you goin'?

344
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:33,248
That would be great.

345
00:20:33,248 --> 00:20:37,252
- Take your hat off.
- Excuse me?

346
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:40,756
They don't sell hot dogs here.
They took the bleachers out
two years ago.

347
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,758
It's my hat.
I'll wear it where i want.

348
00:21:00,275 --> 00:21:02,277
How you doin'?

349
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:17,409
- Thank you.
- Look at him. Douche bag.

350
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,412
Good for you!

351
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,914
Um, send them a bottle
of montepulciano.

352
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:26,918
And, uh, get the license plate
of these two guys
sittin' behind artie.

353
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,920
Get the valet to do it.
They look like cops.

354
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,437
I hear a voice

355
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,440
well, look who's here!
Hi!

356
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:53,695
Tony, look who's here!
Alphonse, how you doin'?

357
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,448
Good. Yeah.
You feelin' better?

358
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:02,337
Gonna miss that
left foot of yours.
Tony.

359
00:22:02,337 --> 00:22:06,341
No, it's okay, mr. Soprano.
I'm gonna play.
No shit.

360
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:09,845
Pardon my french there.
You sure, ally?

361
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:13,849
Yeah, i-- i had a long talk
with coach hauser and--

362
00:22:16,351 --> 00:22:18,353
i'm gonna play.
That's all.

363
00:22:18,353 --> 00:22:21,356
- I told her she didn't have to.
- Just said she wanted to.

364
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:27,362
- Yeah.
- Did coach pressure you,
ally?

365
00:22:27,362 --> 00:22:29,865
No, mrs. Soprano.
He would never do anything
like that.

366
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:32,367
How's he gonna pressure her?
He didn't have thecoglione
to stick around.

367
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:34,369
Dad.
What?

368
00:22:36,238 --> 00:22:38,240
It's what we all wanted.

369
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:43,745
Okay. Right?
Long as everything's, uh--

370
00:22:44,246 --> 00:22:47,249
look, we're trying
to watch this, guys, okay?

371
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,752
Kick ass, girls.
Right?

372
00:22:50,752 --> 00:22:53,255
Good night.

373
00:23:14,276 --> 00:23:16,778
Listen, roberta.
What i said earlier?

374
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:19,281
Mm- hmm.
I'm serious.

375
00:23:19,281 --> 00:23:22,784
You discuss that with anyone,
we're gonna go ten rounds.

376
00:23:22,784 --> 00:23:25,787
We just skimmed 20 thou
off the development fund,

377
00:23:25,787 --> 00:23:28,790
and you're worried about
a littlelecca fica?

378
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,793
Will you keep it down?
All right.

379
00:23:31,793 --> 00:23:36,298
I'll tell everyone
you're a good kisser.
I just won't say where.

380
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:39,301
That's my reputation
you're playin' with.

381
00:23:39,301 --> 00:23:43,805
Honey, my lips are sealed.

382
00:23:43,805 --> 00:23:47,309
Not too sealed, right?

383
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:51,313
Visual on corrado soprano
and female travel companion,

384
00:23:51,313 --> 00:23:54,816
2200 hours, boca lounge.

385
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,216
Hey, hey, hey!
How's my boy today, huh?

386
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:14,219
Go, go, go!

387
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,723
I'm lookin' for, uh,
coach hauser?

388
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,726
That's me. Petey!
Come here!

389
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,597
A little somethin'
from your friends
at the bada bing club.

390
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:30,485
Brand new, surround sound,
hdtv compatible.

391
00:24:30,485 --> 00:24:33,355
- Well, tell them thanks, but--
- this fucker's gettin' heavy.

392
00:24:33,855 --> 00:24:36,858
If this is about rhode island,
tell your friends it's
a done deal. I already signed.

393
00:24:36,858 --> 00:24:41,363
I don't know what it's about,
but the tv stays here.
Put it down.

394
00:24:41,363 --> 00:24:43,365
No!

395
00:24:43,365 --> 00:24:46,868
I mean it! Pick it up!
Get the goddamn thing
off my property!

396
00:24:46,868 --> 00:24:49,871
Look, pal, i don't think
you quite understand.

397
00:24:50,372 --> 00:24:51,873
Oh, i understand
only too well.

398
00:24:52,374 --> 00:24:54,376
You tell your friends
i know all about them.

399
00:24:54,376 --> 00:24:56,878
If you did,
you'd do what they want.

400
00:24:57,379 --> 00:25:00,882
Is that a threat?
How quickly things change.

401
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:03,385
Let me tell you something,
guido--
my name is clarence.

402
00:25:03,385 --> 00:25:07,389
I have friends in
law enforcement, and they
would call this extortion.

403
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,527
Come on.

404
00:25:12,527 --> 00:25:18,033
You tell those assholes
don hauser will not be
intimidated!

405
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:21,036
I will not be threatened
or bribed!

406
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,655
I go where i want to
when i want to!

407
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,159
Hey!

408
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:34,583
All day, every day,
85 and not one drop of rain.

409
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:37,085
Oh, and those nights.

410
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,472
Bobbi, you are so lucky
with this guy.
You have no idea.

411
00:25:40,722 --> 00:25:42,224
He's a sweetheart
underneath it all.

412
00:25:42,724 --> 00:25:45,477
I wish i could get lou
to be like him.

413
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:48,480
More sensitive,
if you know what i mean.

414
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,102
That coral looks good.
I don't understand why i always
have to ask him for oral sex.

415
00:25:55,604 --> 00:25:59,608
Not like you
and your corrado.
Bebe, listen.

416
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:02,360
I know we always used to
yak about our sex lives.

417
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,864
I think it would be better
if we didn't anymore.

418
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,250
Okay.
I mean it.

419
00:26:08,617 --> 00:26:12,120
Sure. It's just
you're lucky, that's all.

420
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,763
- So, ma, you gonna come
to the big game?
- Game?

421
00:26:21,763 --> 00:26:25,267
What game?
Miss meadow's soccer team
is goin' to the sectionals.

422
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:29,771
- Nobody tells me anything.
- Everybody hear me just tell
my mother about the game?

423
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:34,025
Can anybody
think of anything else
to talk about except soccer?

424
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:37,028
All right. Uncle jun',
how was boca?

425
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:40,031
Wonderful.
I don't go down enough.

426
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,901
That's not what i heard.

427
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,404
About what?

428
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,909
Nothing. I'm sorry.
I-- i don't know
what i'm talkin' about.

429
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:54,412
- Last time, aunt bobbi
bought me a live piranha.
- You believe that was a piranha.

430
00:26:54,663 --> 00:26:57,666
That woman is not your aunt!

431
00:26:57,666 --> 00:27:00,168
Livia, i warned you.
Stata zit'.
Bobbi's a sweet, sweet girl.

432
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:04,673
- What the hell's
the matter with you? -

433
00:27:04,673 --> 00:27:07,175
what did i say?

434
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:09,811
This wife of yours.
She's got the giggles.

435
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:13,315
- Can i be excused?
- We just sat down.

436
00:27:13,315 --> 00:27:16,685
- How are you gonna play
tomorrow, you don't eat?
- He's right. You need protein.

437
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:19,688
- No, i don't because i quit.
- You quit.

438
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:22,691
What are you talkin' about?
With ally back, you can
go to the state.

439
00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:25,327
A girl slits her wrists
and you can think about
is a game?

440
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:29,331
It wasn't like friggin' cobain.
It was just a little
suicidal gesture.

441
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:33,451
- Come back here!
- You're not excused!

442
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,587
Oh, let her go.
Go ahead, honey!

443
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,589
Ma!
Why don't you butt out?

444
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,842
Only time you act like
a grandmother is when
you wanna score some points.

445
00:27:42,344 --> 00:27:47,849
I will not eat in this house.
Junior, take me home.

446
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:51,469
- I'm not finished.
- Youmangia, uncle jun'.
She'll come back.

447
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:58,109
The stukas and messerschmitts.

448
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,612
They have command
of the skies.

449
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:07,619
The stuka is quite
a formidable weapon.

450
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:11,623
I don't know.
I'm glad meadow quit.

451
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:15,126
That coach pushes them
to the brink.
It's unhealthy.

452
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,879
Well, what do we mean
when we talk about commitment?

453
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:20,382
And that asshole.
He thinks he can just
walk away?

454
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:22,500
Watch it, cowboy.
Don't start.

455
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,888
What was with you
and uncle jun' tonight?

456
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:29,758
You better not get
in that coach's face.
Tell me about uncle jun'.

457
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:31,760
No, no, stop it!
Stop it!

458
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,762
I can't, i can't.

459
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:36,264
Yes, you can.
I know you want to.
All right. Okay.

460
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:44,022
Gabby dante's cousin and bobbi
go to the same nail parlor.
And--

461
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:49,778
your uncle-- no, i shouldn't
say. I shouldn't!

462
00:28:49,778 --> 00:28:52,163
Come on.
Okay, okay! Okay.

463
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:58,169
Well, let's just say...

464
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:02,674
your uncle has acquired
a taste for her.

465
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:06,928
Uncle jun' gives head.
World- class.

466
00:29:06,928 --> 00:29:10,432
The old man's whistlin'
to the wheat field?
Don't be disgusting.

467
00:29:10,432 --> 00:29:12,434
He's a bushman
of the kalahari!

468
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:16,438
That's why i don't tell you
anything. 'cause you
don't know when to stop.

469
00:29:16,438 --> 00:29:18,940
Oh, my god,
if this ever gets out.

470
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,945
Like you don't do it,
or any of your friends.
Bunch of hypocrites.

471
00:29:23,945 --> 00:29:27,949
Hey. What goes on
in this bedroom stays here,
and you know that.

472
00:29:27,949 --> 00:29:32,954
Once a year?
I can resist the urge
to gossip.

473
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,085
Arthur? You're home?

474
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,587
The grease in that "fryolater."

475
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:52,090
I'm gonna smell like
a cheap french fry
for the rest of my life.

476
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,594
So this is why we scrimp
and save to send our kids
to that school, huh?

477
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,597
So that you can have our name
just dragged through the mud?

478
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:04,102
What?
Shelly hauser called me
this afternoon.

479
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:08,106
Your friends sent somewayos
down there with a stolen
tv set...

480
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,108
to try and bribe the coach.

481
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,610
From your friends
at bada bing.

482
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:17,749
As if a tv set is gonna
get somewhere with a man
like coach hauser!

483
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,751
A tv set?

484
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:24,255
Arthur, do you
honestly believe that
they're gonna stop there?

485
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:27,258
They tried
bribing this man.

486
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:30,762
What's next?
Always with
the extreme scenarios.

487
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,264
No, come on, arthur.
Tell me. What's next?

488
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,266
You grew up
in the neighborhood.

489
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:39,270
Don't pretend
like you don't know what
tony soprano is capable of.

490
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:44,776
Who is it?
I found your dog.

491
00:30:52,033 --> 00:30:56,037
What?
No, you're mistaken.
My dog is upstairs.

492
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:59,657
Golden retriever,
blue nylon collar?

493
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:02,160
Honey, who is it?
Evenin', ma'am.

494
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:07,165
He has our dog.

495
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:10,168
Where's petey?
I thought he was locked in.
Yeah, come get him.

496
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:13,171
I wouldn't want petey
to get hit by a car.

497
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:32,941
Petey, petey!

498
00:31:32,941 --> 00:31:35,944
You okay? Come here.
What, no reward?

499
00:31:37,445 --> 00:31:39,948
Just kiddin'.
I'm an animal lover.

500
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,952
You okay, boy?

501
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:47,088
Med, you can cheer up
about the coach,

502
00:31:47,088 --> 00:31:49,591
'cause i got a feelin'
he's gonna reconsider
the big move.

503
00:31:49,591 --> 00:31:53,094
- Tony!
- Did you do something?

504
00:31:53,094 --> 00:31:55,096
What could i do?
Point is...

505
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:58,099
he's gonna stick around
and finish what he started
with the girls, that's all.

506
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:04,606
That's it.
Well, did i tell you?

507
00:32:10,478 --> 00:32:12,981
You need to develop
some appreciation'cause you
got people all around you...

508
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:16,985
tryin' to help you and
all you do is bitch and moan!

509
00:32:16,985 --> 00:32:20,989
I see this coach tryin' to
abandon his team. I see
your friends gettin' worked up.

510
00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:24,993
So i try to do somethin'!
Is that why you think
we're so upset, dad?

511
00:32:24,993 --> 00:32:28,997
Because a coach that most of us
can't even stand is leaving?

512
00:32:28,997 --> 00:32:32,500
So, w- what difference
does that make? You don't have
to love him to be successful.

513
00:32:32,634 --> 00:32:34,135
Catfish hunter
hated billy martin.

514
00:32:34,636 --> 00:32:38,139
Bill parcells, his guys,
they can't stand him
till they start to win!

515
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,758
Coach hauser had sex
with ally!

516
00:32:42,143 --> 00:32:44,646
What?
That's why she cut herself.

517
00:32:44,646 --> 00:32:49,150
That's why i've been
practically living at her house.

518
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:51,653
All right,
hold on a minute.

519
00:32:51,653 --> 00:32:54,656
Maybe--

520
00:32:54,656 --> 00:32:56,774
with ally?

521
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:02,163
Meadow,
this is horrible. This is
also a very serious accusation.

522
00:33:02,163 --> 00:33:05,533
- What exactly did ally say?
- That they had sex!

523
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:09,037
More than once! That she's
not a virgin anymore!

524
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,425
All right.

525
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:16,928
Ally's a very...
pretty girl.

526
00:33:17,178 --> 00:33:19,681
Maybe there was--
maybe there was some confusion.

527
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:22,183
Maybe she wanted to...

528
00:33:22,183 --> 00:33:24,185
look like she was sophisticated
in you guys' eyes.
Dad!

529
00:33:26,688 --> 00:33:30,191
What?
Tony! What if
this had been meadow?

530
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:32,560
What kind of confusion?

531
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,563
A girl that age, the coach
should not have been
in any position...

532
00:33:36,064 --> 00:33:39,200
where there's even
a remote possibility
of confusion!

533
00:33:40,702 --> 00:33:42,704
I'm losin'
my fuckin' mind here.

534
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,073
Tony, go downstairs,
will you, please,
so me and meadow can talk?

535
00:33:45,073 --> 00:33:48,576
Jesus fuckin' christ!

536
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:50,828
God, now what did i do?

537
00:33:51,212 --> 00:33:55,216
Meadow.
Mom, i only told so he wouldn't
make coach hauser stay here.

538
00:33:55,216 --> 00:33:58,720
Meadow, this is
a horrible, horrible thing.

539
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,223
Mom, she's in love with him,
but he won't leave his wife.

540
00:34:02,223 --> 00:34:04,726
Leave his wife?
Meadow!

541
00:34:07,228 --> 00:34:11,733
Now, meadow, he didn't
touch you, right?
No, but what about deena?

542
00:34:11,733 --> 00:34:14,736
If she finds out
about her father,
it'll totally destroy her life.

543
00:34:14,736 --> 00:34:17,739
Just tell dad to let him go
anywhere he wants, okay?

544
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,241
Come here. Oh.

545
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:30,501
Moldonado and his brother,
they'll handle it.

546
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:33,504
Mal owes me a solid.

547
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:36,007
No. No hired help.

548
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,009
This is personal.

549
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:42,013
Very glad to hear you say that.
I'll give him a real
after- school special.

550
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:48,519
You outta
your fuckin' mind?
What?

551
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:51,889
I know you
kidnapped the coach's dog
and all that other shit.

552
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,392
But if you
do one more thing--
aw, shut up, arthur.

553
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:57,395
You know, you're
five fuckin' time zones
behind your own ass.

554
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:00,898
No, i'm fuckin' serious.
You hear me, tony?

555
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,901
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

556
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:06,904
You wanna hear serious?
You wanna know what your
wonderful fuckin' coach did?

557
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:12,410
He fucked little
ally vandermeed and who
knows who else he fucked.

558
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,662
What are you talkin' about?
"Fucked"?

559
00:35:17,665 --> 00:35:21,669
- That's crazy.
- That's why that kid slit
her wrists, youstunad'.

560
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:27,175
And my daughter should know
this shit, should have to
think about that filth?

561
00:35:27,175 --> 00:35:29,177
No.
No.

562
00:35:29,677 --> 00:35:34,682
That self- righteous prick
put his dick in my little girl's
soccer teammate.

563
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:40,571
She's in eleventh grade,
for christ's sake.
Oh, my god.

564
00:35:40,822 --> 00:35:44,325
Chiara. He drove her home from
the supermarket one night.

565
00:35:44,325 --> 00:35:48,329
- Oh, my little girl.
- Fuckin' degenerate
son of a bitch.

566
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:51,332
He deserves to die.
Betrayin' children?

567
00:35:51,332 --> 00:35:54,836
Artie, believe me,
he ain't gonna be
doin' that shit no more.

568
00:35:54,836 --> 00:35:57,338
I guarantee you that.

569
00:36:06,714 --> 00:36:08,716
He's in the pro shop!

570
00:36:13,721 --> 00:36:15,723
I don't need a cart!

571
00:36:17,725 --> 00:36:20,228
Nobody told you to put
my nephew under surveillance.

572
00:36:20,228 --> 00:36:23,231
I know, junior.
I know.

573
00:36:23,231 --> 00:36:26,234
I just wanted to be
on the safe side,
and i'm glad i did.

574
00:36:26,234 --> 00:36:29,237
Because your nephew
is not just hangin' out
at that titty bar...

575
00:36:29,737 --> 00:36:31,739
and goin' to his daughter's
soccer games.

576
00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:35,243
Go ahead.
Twice last week...

577
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:38,246
he goes toward
the medical center,
then they lose him.

578
00:36:38,746 --> 00:36:41,749
A girlfriend.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

579
00:36:41,749 --> 00:36:44,752
He's seein' this
russian slit, very open.

580
00:36:44,752 --> 00:36:46,754
Your nephew
is talking to the feds.

581
00:36:46,754 --> 00:36:50,758
Where else would he be goin'
where it would require
such precautions?

582
00:36:50,758 --> 00:36:53,761
And what the fuck else
would be the big secret?

583
00:36:53,761 --> 00:36:55,763
What am i, a swami?

584
00:36:57,265 --> 00:36:59,767
Hey.

585
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:03,271
Silvio! You're lookin'
good. I like that hat.
Mikey palmice.

586
00:37:03,271 --> 00:37:07,275
How you feel?

587
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:13,531
You shanked it, sil.
I still got the coach
on my mind.

588
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:19,537
We got fresh air,
sunshine, a beautiful day.
Forget about that shit.

589
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:23,541
- Thank god for golf some days.
- I'm trying to concentrate
here.

590
00:37:25,793 --> 00:37:29,297
- Did you get any golf in
down in boca, uncle jun'?
- Fuckin' manners! Please!

591
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:37,054
So you play, uh, manatee
or what's the name
of the other one?

592
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:42,059
Will you let the man tee off?
You yap worse than six barbers.

593
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,562
If you'd have shut up
during that game
against mountain lakes,

594
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:47,565
you wouldn't have missed
that fuckin' fly ball.

595
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,567
I was ashamed
to face my friends.

596
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:54,572
Good mikey. Better.

597
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:58,576
What do you mean,"better"?
Well, you know,
it's...better.

598
00:38:04,832 --> 00:38:09,720
- Whoa, junior!
- "Whoa, junior" what?

599
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,974
Uncle junior's into muff.
What?

600
00:38:13,975 --> 00:38:17,228
Oh, did i say "muff"?
I meant "rough."

601
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,233
Good shot.

602
00:38:25,486 --> 00:38:28,489
What's that smell?
Did you guys go to a sushi bar?

603
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:31,242
What the fuck's
he talkin' about?
I don't know.

604
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:34,862
I thought you were
a baccala man, uncle jun'. What
are you doin' eatin' sushi?

605
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:38,499
You're fuckin' runnin' off
at the mouth, you know that?

606
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:42,870
South of the border?

607
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,873
Down mexico way

608
00:38:45,873 --> 00:38:49,510
listen, my friend.
At least i can deal...

609
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:52,013
with my own problems,
unlike some i know.

610
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:56,017
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Take it however you want.
Don't bullshit with me.

611
00:38:56,017 --> 00:38:58,636
Guys, guys.
We here to play golf or what?

612
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,889
Come on.

613
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,392
South of the border?

614
00:39:04,892 --> 00:39:08,029
Where the tuna fish play

615
00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:12,033
arthur.

616
00:39:12,033 --> 00:39:14,535
Everybody's just so upset.

617
00:39:14,535 --> 00:39:18,539
The mother's on sedatives.
She's completely
unable to deal.

618
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:21,042
The father was
in europe somewhere.
They haven't reached him.

619
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:25,046
The little girl, ally, she
thinks it's all her fault.

620
00:39:25,046 --> 00:39:27,548
Lousy bastard. He's not
gonna get away with this.

621
00:39:27,548 --> 00:39:30,051
You got that right.

622
00:39:30,551 --> 00:39:32,553
What?

623
00:39:33,554 --> 00:39:36,057
Hand me that bottle
of bug be gone,
will ya?

624
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:38,559
Arthur, what?

625
00:39:40,561 --> 00:39:44,565
Somethin' goin' on,
artie?

626
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:47,435
Your mobster friend
gonna do somethin' crazy?

627
00:39:49,937 --> 00:39:52,940
If i had any balls,
i would do it myself.

628
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:56,444
Arthur, you do have balls.
That's why you're not like him.

629
00:39:56,944 --> 00:40:00,448
Fuck it. Fuck the world!

630
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:03,334
Artie, this isn't makin'
some slob take his hat off.

631
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:08,589
This is beating a man to death
or cutting his balls off
or what?

632
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:11,842
You can't tell me coach hauser
doesn't deserve it!

633
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:16,347
Okay, but-- listen to you.
Think about what you're saying.

634
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,215
Yeah, you tell me.

635
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:22,219
Who's worse? Tony soprano
or that child- molesting fuck?

636
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:26,223
I trusted him.
I'd like to rip his heart
out of his chest!

637
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:30,111
Jesus christ, arthur.
I cannot believe you only
think about yourself!

638
00:40:30,611 --> 00:40:34,365
Myself? Myself?

639
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:37,985
I resent that, charmaine!

640
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:51,132
Junior, what the fuck?
What's the matter?

641
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:56,137
What? That bullshit
with the sushi?

642
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:02,643
Nah, i-- i don't know
what he was talkin' about.
He, uh, he babbles.

643
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,762
What was that?
You're another one!

644
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:08,015
Me? Hey, he completely
lacked respect.

645
00:41:08,015 --> 00:41:10,518
Sick and tired of having to
make excuses for him
all the time.

646
00:41:11,018 --> 00:41:13,521
- It isn't right.
- It's'cause he's
a fucking mental weakling.

647
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:16,023
- I know.
- You don't know shit, mikey!

648
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:24,915
He's seein' a psychiatrist,
for christ's sake.
How about that, huh?

649
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:29,420
My nephew
is seein' a psychiatrist.
Makes me wanna cry.

650
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:34,425
- No shit?
- Indictment's being prepared.
He's spilling his guts.

651
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,928
- I fuckin' knew it.
- No, you didn't
fuckin' know it!

652
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:40,931
I just told you.

653
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:46,437
God knows how much of
our family business he airs.
If the place is bugged--

654
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:48,439
that stuff's not admissible.

655
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:53,444
It's that, uh, that, that
doctor/patient privilege,
just like us and melvoin.

656
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:56,947
Melvoin's a lawyer.
He's in the fuckin' ballpark.

657
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:59,450
Suppose this shrink
gets scared or somethin'?

658
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,453
Do you remember those fuckin'
escovedo brothers, whoever
the fuck, in california?

659
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:06,957
They whacked their parents?
Their shrink was in
a fuckin' witness chair.

660
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:09,960
Shit.

661
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:15,466
Anthony wants to play games,
okay.

662
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:18,969
I taught him games.

663
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:21,472
I taught him
how to play baseball.

664
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:26,977
You talking
about clippin' him?

665
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:29,480
Nobody would slap my wrist
if i did.

666
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,068
There's guys in prison
that have done half the damage
this prick has.

667
00:42:34,568 --> 00:42:38,439
The judicial system has gotten
much better in dealing with
sexual predators.

668
00:42:38,439 --> 00:42:40,441
Oh, yeah.
Let's impeach him.

669
00:42:40,441 --> 00:42:42,443
If you're telling me of intent
to harm this person,

670
00:42:42,443 --> 00:42:46,447
i must warn you of my duty
to alert law enforcement.

671
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,083
I don't know why
i tell you anything.
I'm interested...

672
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:52,703
in why you feel punishing
this man falls upon you.

673
00:42:52,953 --> 00:42:55,339
- Well, it sure doesn't
fall upon you.
- What do you mean?

674
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:57,341
What would you do?
You'd call the cops,

675
00:42:57,341 --> 00:43:00,344
who'd get some judge
who'd give him
psychiatric counseling.

676
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,346
So maybe he could talk about
his unhappy childhood...

677
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:06,467
and we could have sympathy
for the fuck'cause he's
the real victim here, right?

678
00:43:06,467 --> 00:43:09,853
You know what you do? Stick
your head in the sand'cause
that's what people like you do.

679
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:12,473
Discredit psychology
all you want,

680
00:43:12,473 --> 00:43:14,975
but i continue
to ask the question:

681
00:43:14,975 --> 00:43:20,364
Why do you think
you, anthony soprano,
always has to set things right?

682
00:43:28,989 --> 00:43:31,492
Hey, paulie. Is tony in?
Tony!

683
00:43:31,492 --> 00:43:33,994
- Artie!
- Hey, ton', i gotta talk to ya.

684
00:43:34,495 --> 00:43:37,247
- Kinda busy right now.
- I gotta talk to you.

685
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:41,885
All right, we'll, uh,
finish later, all right?

686
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:56,900
Come on in.
Hey.

687
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:06,910
It's about, uh, the thing.

688
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,413
You know what?

689
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:12,533
Nothing's happened yet,
has it?

690
00:44:12,533 --> 00:44:16,670
Just gotta make the call.
I'm savorin' the moment.

691
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:18,922
- You gotta call it off.
- Don't worry about it.

692
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:21,425
You got nothin' to do
with it. You don't
go nowheres near this.

693
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:25,295
I don't care about that!
It's wrong, tony.

694
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:29,800
You can't do it.
It's wrong?
Oh, what he did isn't?

695
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:32,436
I'm beggin' you.
I hate the guy too.

696
00:44:34,054 --> 00:44:36,440
What do you wanna do,
artie?

697
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,444
You wanna call the cops?
Here. Here's the phone.

698
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:44,565
They'll arrest him, right?
He'll get out in two fuckin'
years, move to saskatchewan.

699
00:44:44,565 --> 00:44:48,569
Then you know what he'll do?
He'll teach girls' soccer,
and he'll start all over again.

700
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:52,956
You don't think
i wanna rip him apart
like a fuckin' chicken?

701
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:56,460
I drove by his house.
I almost got out.

702
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,462
But you didn't.

703
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:02,583
Something happens to him,
who's it gonna help, huh?
His daughter?

704
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:07,087
That girl? No, you, tony.

705
00:45:07,087 --> 00:45:09,590
And silvio and me and whoever.

706
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:12,092
It's just gonna
make us feel better.

707
00:45:12,092 --> 00:45:16,597
So don't even think about
calling this justice.
Leave it to the cops.

708
00:45:17,097 --> 00:45:19,099
Let me ask you a question.

709
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:23,103
Who the fuck do you think
you are comin' in here,
talkin' to me like this?

710
00:45:23,103 --> 00:45:27,107
Now your boyfriend
is finished.
You deal with it.

711
00:45:27,107 --> 00:45:30,611
Okay?
Tony, don't do it.

712
00:45:30,611 --> 00:45:34,114
This is me asking you.
Why don't you
get the fuck outta here?

713
00:45:34,114 --> 00:45:37,618
Come on.
Get the fuck out!
Go!

714
00:45:37,618 --> 00:45:40,621
Let's go.
Come on, come on.

715
00:45:53,634 --> 00:45:56,136
Oh, yeah

716
00:45:56,136 --> 00:45:58,138
oh, yeah

717
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:08,899
dewayne, dewayne

718
00:46:18,792 --> 00:46:20,794

719
00:46:23,797 --> 00:46:25,799
yeah

720
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:37,060
yeah

721
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:48,188
yeah

722
00:46:52,192 --> 00:46:54,695
dewayne

723
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:01,585
corrado.

724
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:06,590
I was worried! You usually
call me when you're this late.

725
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:12,095
I bought us some
barbecued chicken, some salad
and some lemon meringue pie.

726
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:14,097
But i got so hungry,
i had a piece.

727
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:17,100
Did i tell you
to keep your mouth shut?
What?

728
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,103
Did i tell you to keep
your goddamned mouth shut?

729
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:23,106
No, corrado, don't hit me!

730
00:47:39,373 --> 00:47:41,375
You stupid, fucking,
blabbermouth cunt!

731
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:44,878
I don't understand.

732
00:47:44,878 --> 00:47:47,381
Get your pencils
and your crap and
the rest of your shit...

733
00:47:47,881 --> 00:47:50,884
and don't be here tomorrow!

734
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:54,755
Oh, no, corrado, don't leave!
I love you!

735
00:47:56,757 --> 00:47:59,259
I am so sorry!

736
00:47:59,393 --> 00:48:01,395
No, corrado!

737
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:24,668
Yeah.
You there at the place?

738
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:26,670
Is he in the house?
Yeah.

739
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,673
Fuck it. Walk away.

740
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:31,675
Just fuckin' walk away.
Don't do it.

741
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:33,677
Fuck!

742
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:35,679
All right.
Leave it alone.

743
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:38,181
Yeah, no problem.

744
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:40,684
Son of a bitch.

745
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:43,186
Lynn, we are here live
as colleagues and neighbors...

746
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:47,307
were shocked to hear of charges
brought against donald hauser,

747
00:48:47,441 --> 00:48:50,444
coach of the
verbum dei high school
girls' soccer team.

748
00:48:50,944 --> 00:48:53,447
Alerted by a student friend
of the alleged victim,

749
00:48:53,814 --> 00:48:56,450
whose name cannot be revealed
because of her age,

750
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:58,952
police issued a warrant for
hauser's arrest this evening.

751
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:13,333
Tony.
In my hometown

752
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:15,836
tony, jesus.
Where i live

753
00:49:15,836 --> 00:49:19,339
you smell like
lord calvert.

754
00:49:22,843 --> 00:49:24,845
Tony.

755
00:49:27,848 --> 00:49:30,350
We don't talk
we all get together

756
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:34,354
any kind of weather
and we do the camel walk

757
00:49:41,862 --> 00:49:46,366
what is with you tonight?

758
00:49:46,366 --> 00:49:48,502
Tony, what is this?

759
00:49:48,502 --> 00:49:51,505
Oh, jesus.

760
00:49:51,505 --> 00:49:55,008
Mixed with alcohol.
Oh, tony, that's wonderful.

761
00:49:55,008 --> 00:49:59,629
- Happy trails.
Here, let's get you to bed.
- Carmela.

762
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:02,132
Carmela.

763
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:05,635
I didn't hurt nobody.

764
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:21,284
Call the shrink.

765
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:23,787
Tell her the town's gonna go
to the fuckin' mormons.

766
00:50:47,894 --> 00:50:49,996
I hear a voice

767
00:50:52,699 --> 00:50:55,035
from the back of the room

768
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,906
i hear a voice

769
00:50:59,906 --> 00:51:02,609

770
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:05,178
