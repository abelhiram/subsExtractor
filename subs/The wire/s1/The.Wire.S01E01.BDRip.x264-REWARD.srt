1
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,819
- So, your boy's name is what?
- Snot.

2
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:32,240
- You called the guy Snot?
- Snotboogie, yeah.

3
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:35,952
Snotboogie? He like the name?

4
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,995
- What?
- Snotboogie.

5
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:45,294
This kid whose mama went to the trouble
of christening him Omar Isaiah Betts?

6
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,923
You know, he forgets his jacket...

7
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:54,387
so his nose starts running,
and some asshole,

8
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,973
instead of giving him a Kleenex,
calls him Snot.

9
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,518
So, he's Snot forever.

10
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:06,149
- Doesn't seem fair.
- Life just be that way, I guess.

11
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:11,237
So, who shot Snot?

12
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,156
I ain't going in no court.

13
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:25,251
- Motherfucker ain't have to put no cap in him.
- Definitely not.

14
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,212
He coulda just whipped his ass,
like we always do.

15
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,131
- I agree with you.
- He gonna kill Snot.

16
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,134
Snot been doing the same shit
since I don't know how long.

17
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,553
Kill a man over some bullshit.

18
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:42,143
I'm saying, every Friday night

19
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,936
in the alley behind the cut-rate,

20
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,438
we rolling bones.

21
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,732
All the boys from here,
we roll till late.

22
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,484
Alley crap game, right?

23
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,486
And like every time,

24
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,489
Snot, he'd fade a few shooters.

25
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,074
Play it out till the pot's deep.

26
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:58,951
Then he'd snatch and run.

27
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:01,954
Every time?

28
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,664
Couldn't help hisself.

29
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:09,295
Let me understand you. Every Friday night,
you and your boys would shoot crap, right?

30
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:12,048
And every Friday night,
your pal Snotboogie...

31
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:16,719
he'd wait till there was cash on the ground,
then grab the money and run away?

32
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,262
You let him do that?

33
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,389
We catch him and beat his ass.

34
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,766
But ain't nobody ever go past that.

35
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,229
I gotta ask you.

36
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:30,608
If every time Snotboogie
would grab the money and run away...

37
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,487
why'd you even let him in the game?

38
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,613
What?

39
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:39,826
If Snotboogie always stole the money,
why'd you let him play?

40
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:43,579
Got to. This America, man.

41
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,639
<i>If you walk through the garden</i>

42
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,809
<i>You better watch your back</i>

43
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,689
<i>Well, I beg your pardon</i>

44
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,608
<i>Walk the straight and narrow track</i>

45
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,612
<i>If you walk with Jesus</i>

46
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,282
<i>He'll save your soul</i>

47
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,662
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

48
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,291
<i>Down in the hole</i>

49
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,878
<i>All the angels sing</i>

50
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,131
<i>About Jesus' mighty sword</i>

51
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,843
<i>And they shield you with their wings</i>

52
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,181
<i>Keep you close to the Lord</i>

53
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,851
<i>Don't pay heed to temptation</i>

54
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:51,731
<i>For his hands are so cold</i>

55
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,859
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

56
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,863
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

57
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,415
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

58
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,336
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

59
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:18,299
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

60
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,010
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

61
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,186
- Guess what he said.
- What?

62
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,483
- Gotta let him play, this America.
- No fucking way. He give you the shooter?

63
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,653
Three Newports and a Grape Nehi
he's grand juried. It's down, Bunk.

64
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,821
Barksdale's in Part 12, right?

65
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,615
Project murder, Westside.

66
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,742
- Which one, now?
- Never mind.

67
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,204
- Let's sit in on it for a bit.
- Where you gonna be?

68
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,040
I'm gonna drop this off on Nathan,
then I'm going to the office.

69
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,085
Don't answer no phones, Bunk.

70
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,298
Is that your signature
on that photo array card?

71
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,008
Yes.

72
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:05,221
- And your initials, next to the photo?
- Yes.

73
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:10,977
Mr. Gant, do you see the man
you identified from that photo array card...

74
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,729
sitting in the courtroom today?

75
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,077
He's right there.

76
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,707
For the record, the witness has identified
the defendant, D'Angelo Barksdale.

77
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,419
- Your witness.
- Thank you.

78
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,089
Just one question, Mr. Gant.

79
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,009
Had you ever seen this young man
before the day in question?

80
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,930
No, no.

81
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,434
No further questions, your honor.

82
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:56,772
You're excused, Mr. Gant.
Call your next witness.

83
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,276
State calls Nakeisha Lyles,
your honor.

84
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:17,835
Do you promise to tell the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth?

85
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,128
I do.

86
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:26,093
- Can you state your name, please?
- Nakeisha Lyles.

87
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,055
- And are you employed?
- Yes, I am.

88
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,683
- And what is your occupation, Ms. Lyles?
- I'm a security guard.

89
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:37,480
And were you employed as a security guard
on May 4th, the day of the shooting?

90
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:43,110
- What were your duties on that date?
- I was in the booth of 221.

91
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:47,990
The guard booth in the lobby
of the Fremont Avenue high-rise?

92
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,575
Yes.

93
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,329
Behind bulletproof glass,
with a clear view of the lobby?

94
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,247
- Yeah.
- Good.

95
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,336
Ms. Lyles, I know this may be difficult,
but can you tell us what you saw?

96
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,423
A man, he was waiting
for the elevator,

97
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:07,218
when another man just
starts beating on him...

98
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:10,429
and like, the one man,
he got knocked down...

99
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:13,724
- The victim?
- No, the man with the gun.

100
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,727
The man who was knocked
down had a gun.

101
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:21,023
And do you see that man
in the courtroom today?

102
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,030
Nope.

103
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,575
Excuse me?

104
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:35,746
He ain't here.

105
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,376
You don't...?

106
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,045
You testified.

107
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:49,426
Do you remember when Detective
Barlow showed you this photo array?

108
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,095
Yeah.

109
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:55,808
Good. I call your attention to your initials
which identify this photo

110
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,644
as the man who shot Mr. Blanchard.

111
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,356
Did you write your initials
above that photograph?

112
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,612
He ain't the one that did the shooting.

113
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,781
But you identified him.

114
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,450
He looked like the boy that did it.

115
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,413
See, the one that did it,
I saw him come in the building a week later.

116
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,001
You saw someone else
you thought did the shooting?

117
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,461
Right, a week later.

118
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,841
Ms. Lyles, when you spoke
with the detectives

119
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:33,220
- you never said anything about...
- I tried. I called Detective...

120
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:41,729
Yeah, Detective Barlow
on May 13th at 2 p.m.

121
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,649
- But he didn't call me back.
- Nicely done.

122
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,611
- You called Detective Barlow?
- Yeah, twice.

123
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,822
Yeah, I wrote it down in the log.

124
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:57,077
- I need a price for pressure-treated.
- $14.

125
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,914
That's the price that
you were going to quote me?

126
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,710
Do you feel that, Mikey?
That is my fucking dick in your ear.

127
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,297
- Oh, that's nice.
- Hang on, you fucking thief. What's up?

128
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:09,965
You been down the hall?

129
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,384
- What?
- Your case just hit the wall.

130
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:14,094
Barksdale's crew, they turned it.

131
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,348
Two eyewitnesses and a statement.
No fucking way, pal.

132
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,645
You listen to me, you little shit,
there is no way in hell I am paying that.

133
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,191
You use my car
to chauffeur that dusty bitch.

134
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,318
- Yo, ease up.
- You don't understand.

135
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,988
- I did it for that man and he do this.
- Getting heated ain't gonna help.

136
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:37,576
- Greggs, what's she saying?
- It ain't what she says.

137
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,453
Yeah? What do you say?

138
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:42,498
I say we wait, shithead.

139
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,419
- That's him.
- All right, easy, girl.

140
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,381
- Yo, Herc, you got that?
- Yeah, we see.

141
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:51,674
Are the uniforms on the horn?

142
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:52,758
They're on hold.

143
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:53,842
That's Ghost.

144
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,594
All right, good, Tiff.

145
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,388
Now tell me what I'm seeing.

146
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,848
- He gonna get little Mike.
- Then what?

147
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,850
Mike come back with the money.

148
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,772
Wait on the drop,
take the car when it's deep in the block.

149
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,941
I don't want no foot chase.

150
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,276
Copy.

151
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,072
Got it.

152
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,367
Go, go, go. The driver's mine.

153
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,620
Get the house on the left.

154
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,623
Get back. Get on the ground.
Get down.

155
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,252
- Put your hands behind your head.
- Get your hands up.

156
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,838
Shut the engine.
Get that motherfucker round the corner.

157
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,966
Hand the keys out.
Drop the keys out of the car.

158
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,969
Drop them down. Get out of the car.

159
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,682
Get down right here, right here.
Get down.

160
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,601
Passenger, put your hands
out of the window.

161
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,730
Both hands out of the car window.
Use your right hand, open the door.

162
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:52,067
Slowly. Step out of the car.
Step out of the car!

163
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,945
- Down on the ground.
- Don't move.

164
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,030
Down on the ground.

165
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,910
That's it, take his ass to jail.

166
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,746
- You got him, Carv?
- I got him.

167
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,084
- Look at this shit.
- Cross your legs.

168
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,131
Look at this.

169
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,384
You see what he did?
Do you see what he did?!

170
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,846
Why he throw the gun on my car?
Shit gonna scratch the paint!

171
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,016
- Stay in the car.
- Tell him to leave my car be!

172
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,935
- Stay in the fucking car.
- That shit just ain't right.

173
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,188
Whatcha doing with something
like that?

174
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,523
What you got here?

175
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,778
Shoulda seen the way
this bitch was looking at me, Kima.

176
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,781
Ugly little fucker almost shit his pants
he was so scared.

177
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,200
Right?

178
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,213
Two guns, remember?

179
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,384
- Two?
- It's all good, Kima, ease up.

180
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,477
All rise.

181
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,481
Part 12 of the Circuit Court
of Baltimore City is now in session.

182
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,525
Be seated.

183
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,487
Madame Forelady,
you have a unanimous verdict?

184
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,659
As to the defendant
D'Angelo Barksdale,

185
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,829
how say you to the charge of murder
in the first degree?

186
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,705
Not guilty.

187
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,668
How say you to the charge of murder
in the second degree?

188
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,797
- Not guilty.
- Yes!

189
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,091
Be seated.

190
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:42,719
- It's you, daddy, yeah!
- Order.

191
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,013
- At least you made 'em work for it.
- Be seated.

192
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,810
The jury is to be thanked
for its services in this case.

193
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:54,106
Deputies will return
defendant Barksdale to pre-trial

194
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,275
for processing prior to his release.

195
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:07,995
Think I give a fuck?
I'll be chalking you off one night.

196
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,583
- You have a nice day.
- Yo, Stringer, let's go.

197
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,050
Detective?

198
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,720
Detective?

199
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,223
Detective.
Judge asked to speak with you.

200
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,273
- What the hell happened out there?
- We lost.

201
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,193
- Were you on this?
- The case?

202
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,404
No, it was Barlow,
with an assist from McLarney.

203
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,406
If it was Barlow's case,
why are you in court?

204
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,450
No reason.

205
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:51,246
You just like coming to court on murders
you don't work? For the thrill of it?

206
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,919
When you start coming with the customers,
it's time to get out of the business.

207
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,421
You shouldn't talk dirty
now you're a judge.

208
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,216
Now I'm a judge,
I can say anything I damn please.

209
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,928
That Barksdale kid,
he's a cousin to Avon Barksdale.

210
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,307
- Who?
- Avon Barksdale, Stringer Bell.

211
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,602
The crew that's been running
Franklin Terrace.

212
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,187
Stringer Bell?

213
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:19,358
In court with the legal pad and glasses,
scaring the shit out of every witness.

214
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,611
Him and his crew...
Wee-Bey, Savino, Stinkum.

215
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,864
- I saw them.
- You think about clearing the court?

216
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,243
On what basis?
It's an open court in a free nation of laws.

217
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,911
I thought it was Baltimore.

218
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,207
Barksdale has five out of seven

219
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,708
towers in the Terrace.

220
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,794
That's ten stairwells
in five high-rises,

221
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,587
going 24/7 for dope and coke.

222
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,506
That's just the towers.

223
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,008
The low-rises, corners, they're his too.

224
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,760
How do you know?

225
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,055
- Everybody knows.
- Everybody?

226
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,848
Everybody on the Westside.

227
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,937
Barksdale and Bell, they're the new power.

228
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,815
They've dropped
10 or 12 bodies in as many months.

229
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:02,693
Beat three cases in court
doing the same thing.

230
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,195
- Who's working on them?
- In the department?

231
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,657
Nobody, really.

232
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:14,621
We're a little busy doing street rips.
Community policing and all that.

233
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,624
So, if it's not your case,
why do you care?

234
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,545
Who said I did?

235
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,263
One more time. One more time.

236
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,516
Stop playing...

237
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,312
Fuck me.

238
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,650
You got submission numbers
for the ECU?

239
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,360
- Nope.
- Get 'em.

240
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:49,573
- Why me?
- You want the collar, do the submissions.

241
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,826
- You giving me the start?
- It's your turn.

242
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,703
What's the extension for ECU?

243
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,706
Do I look like your bitch?

244
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,084
- We taking the Mercedes?
- No, I promised my girl.

245
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,170
Car's in her name.

246
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,422
Narcotics.

247
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,467
- Lieutenant. Line two.
- Here you go.

248
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,553
- Fuck me, I cannot type.
- Who the fuck can?

249
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:15,599
Millennium gone, and we still
fuck around with Smith Corona.

250
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,394
We need them computers.
They promised to train us a year ago.

251
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:23,398
What would an ignorant motherfucker
like you do with a computer?

252
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,985
- Trade stocks and shit.
- Jerk off, you mean.

253
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,656
We get them computers hooked up,
Herc'll be deep into some porn

254
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,159
and Kima'll still be bangin' out
her 24s on that old piece of shit.

255
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,161
- Gotta go upstairs.
- What's up?

256
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,913
Deputy's throwing some piss-fit.

257
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,083
- Major know?
- He's up there now.

258
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,379
With a mouthful of piss, probably.

259
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,964
Our major don't know
what that tastes like?

260
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,218
It's the chain-of-command,
the shit rolls downhill.

261
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:55,013
- Motherfucker, we talking about piss.
- Piss does too, think about it.

262
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,850
- Shit rolls, piss trickles.
- Downhill, though.

263
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,560
You don't know that for sure...

264
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,355
Not to change the subject
on you two charmers...

265
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,358
- But why are there only two ECU numbers?
- Dope and guns.

266
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,777
Two guns, right?

267
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,363
- That's three.
- Fuck it, Kima.

268
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,616
You want a job done right,
you gotta do it yourself.

269
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,206
He means we are an effective deterrent
on the war on drugs

270
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,418
- when we are on the street.
- Fucking motherfuckers up.

271
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,670
- Indeed.
- Fuck the paperwork.

272
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,505
Collect bodies, split heads.

273
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,966
- Split them wide.
- The Western District way.

274
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,594
- Aye.
- You heroic motherfuckers kill me.

275
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:39,808
Fighting the war on drugs,
one brutality case at a time.

276
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,352
Girl, you can't call this shit a war.

277
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,480
- Why not?
- Wars end.

278
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,112
You gonna write that down?

279
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:02,080
How happy am I to see my pager go off
with your call number?

280
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:05,751
Smoke 'em if you got 'em because
this motherfucker is as ripe as they get.

281
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:09,212
- We aren't up, Nolan's squad is up.
- I know.

282
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,214
But you answered the fucking phone.

283
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,342
- Got to pay down my credit cards.
- Not off him.

284
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:18,263
- I leave you alone, what do you do?
- All right, I heard you.

285
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,223
Say the words, Bunk.

286
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,350
- Come on, man.
- Speak to me.

287
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,812
So, you gonna cut and run on the Bunk?
That shit ain't right, Jimmy.

288
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:30,317
All right, then this is my case.
My file.

289
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:34,696
This shit comes back a murder, you ain't
gotta do shit but stand there and laugh.

290
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,156
You happy now, bitch?

291
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,326
This'll teach you to give a fuck
when it ain't your turn.

292
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,536
It ain't even gonna be a murder.

293
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:45,332
This motherfucker probably came in
to take a shit and just fell out.

294
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,125
I bet there's nothing to it.

295
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,002
- You hope.
- Where you going?

296
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,089
Back to the office, where I belong.

297
00:18:56,886 --> 00:19:01,389
You moldering motherfucker, don't even
think about coming back a murder.

298
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,892
Don't even think of that shit.

299
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,899
By tomorrow, Lieutenant.
Don't fail me.

300
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,534
Major's pissed.

301
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:24,287
He should be. He didn't have answers
for the deputy's questions.

302
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,374
- About what?
- Avon Barksdale.

303
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,000
Who?

304
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,922
- That's what I said.
- Who the fuck is Avon Barksdale?

305
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,883
According to the right honorable
Judge Phelan,

306
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:39,761
a Westside player who indulges
in the occasional murder.

307
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:45,475
Now, as of today, I never heard of
Mr. Barksdale, but by tomorrow...

308
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,022
All right, what do we know?

309
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,692
The judge says
he has the Westside high-rises.

310
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,443
The Terrace, mostly.

311
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,989
- Sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me.
- Maybe so.

312
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,495
- It's gotta be tonight?
- Major wants it filed by morning.

313
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,628
Call Andrews at DEA.
See what they have on this mope.

314
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:18,133
- What about Homicide?
- Homicide major was in the meeting.

315
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,927
His people will be scrambling
to get something too.

316
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,889
I doubt they'll be willing to share.

317
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,936
Barksdale, Avon.

318
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,230
Got a DOB?

319
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:49,247
- Jay.
- Where the fuck you been all day?

320
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:53,335
Drinking, crack smoking.
Whoring myself on the streets of Baltimore.

321
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,171
OK. Just so you have an excuse.

322
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:59,215
But your fuck of a partner caught a call.

323
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,344
- Yeah, I saw him out there.
- Yeah, what'd he get?

324
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,931
- Decomp in a vacant apartment.
- Fuck.

325
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,934
Nolan's squad was up, that one's theirs.

326
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:11,311
It's a decomp.
It may come back a natural death.

327
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,439
- You think?
- In the Poe Homes, no fucking way.

328
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:17,567
Hold up. Major wants to talk to you
before you roll out.

329
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:21,321
- What about?
- Fuck should I know, I'm only your sergeant.

330
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,665
Sit the fuck down, Detective.

331
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,417
Something wrong?

332
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,296
Put your ass in the chair.

333
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,604
You see these, McNulty, you see them?
These are for you.

334
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:58,483
These are for you
for as long as it takes me to get even.

335
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,235
Major, what...?

336
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,864
Don't Major me, you backstabbing,
smartass piece of shit.

337
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,118
What the fuck you doing
at the courthouse?

338
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,996
Why the fuck are you talking
to some shitbag judge?

339
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,917
These are for you, McNulty.

340
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:19,462
This one over here is going up
your narrow fucking Irish ass.

341
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,298
And this bad boy is
in your fucking eye.

342
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:26,469
I'm answering questions about
some project nigger I never heard of

343
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,555
who's beat my unit out of ten murders.

344
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:33,226
- Three. They only beat three in court.
- I got the deputy asking about ten.

345
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,354
No, they did ten,
we only charged them with three.

346
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,565
You're full of shit.

347
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,275
Sir, you can check the files.

348
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:44,404
Maurice Scroggins,
Toreen Boyd, Roland Leggett.

349
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:48,783
The girl they found in the stairwell
in Saratoga, Collette something.

350
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,660
Major, these guys are real.

351
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:54,581
They beat me up on the Gerard Bogue case
just like they did Barlow.

352
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:59,711
Scroggins? I don't have
an H-file on Scroggins.

353
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:03,381
He was last year, summer. Two in
the back of the head, low-rise courtyard.

354
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,343
Let me understand something.

355
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:11,931
You are having the deputy
bust my balls over a prior-year case?

356
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,519
Is this what I need from you,
you insubordinate little fuck?

357
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,314
Major, I'm really sorry.

358
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,358
Phelan, he and I,
we go back a little.

359
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:25,737
He wanted to know about
the crew in his court...

360
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,572
I had to go upstairs

361
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:32,243
and explain to the deputy why he's getting
calls about murders that don't mean a shit.

362
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:35,163
Look, sir, this judge, he fucks me up.

363
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:38,249
He asks me a question and I answer it.

364
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,543
I didn't know he was gonna call anybody.

365
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,425
You have my attention, Detective.

366
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,011
My complete, undivided attention.

367
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,185
- Yes, sir.
- Where you going?

368
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,355
- I'm eight to four.
- No.

369
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:02,690
- You're typing.
- Sir?

370
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,945
Deputy wants a report
on his desk at 0800.

371
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:10,698
- A report?
- Clean, no typos.

372
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,201
Make it look right,
then put my name on it.

373
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,539
Do you want to reference all the murders
or should I soft-pedal that?

374
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,291
Fucking horse is out
the barn door, right?

375
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:22,794
Let's try not to make me
look stupid twice.

376
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:28,007
And when you list the cases,
put a little dot next to each one.

377
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:31,636
- Deputy likes dots.
- I'm sorry, Major, really.

378
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:49,112
Niggers crazy in there, yo.
Eastside, Westside, everybody beefing.

379
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,825
- You ain't got no problem, right?
- Hell no, we deep in there.

380
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:58,413
Y'all deep down at the courthouse too.

381
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,583
I didn't know what the fuck
would happen.

382
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:05,170
I'm wondering how y'all gonna make it
happen for me, you know?

383
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:09,841
Slick what y'all did with that security lady.
That shit was tight, yo.

384
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,348
Let's walk.

385
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,782
- What's the rule?
- I know the rule.

386
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:39,454
- Say it.
- Don't talk in the car.

387
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,709
Or on the phone
or any place that ain't ours.

388
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,420
Or to anybody who ain't us.
But it was just you.

389
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,088
It's your fucking truck.

390
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,717
Don't talk in the car.

391
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:16,324
<i>My friends, yeah</i>

392
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:21,621
<i>Feel it's their appointed duty</i>

393
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,752
<i>They keep trying to tell me...</i>

394
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,128
What about Marcel?

395
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,466
No, I ain't inviting Marcel.

396
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,803
- You want him out?
- I really don't give a shit what you do.

397
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,596
Actually, no.

398
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,349
Go down and make that motherfucker
pay for his drinks.

399
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,518
The bum.

400
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:45,395
Oh, boy!

401
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,362
- How you doing?
- What's up, D? Good to see you.

402
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,031
What up, man?
I ain't seen you in a long time.

403
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:03,371
Yo, you remember the cop
that tried to pin Gerard on little Kevin?

404
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,749
- Which one?
- White detective, black hair.

405
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:10,378
- The one that was knocking on all the doors.
- What about him?

406
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:13,756
He showed up in court to watch.

407
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,009
Word.

408
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:20,096
What are you talking to
that motherfucker for? Damn, D.

409
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:24,350
- He say anything?
- No, just sat in the back.

410
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:37,196
- What up?
- What you got?

411
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,991
Come here,
I got something for you.

412
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,257
- You must feel good.
- You know how that go.

413
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,927
- Say what?
- I'm saying, you know, jail ain't no joke.

414
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,929
I don't know shit about jail.

415
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,432
I don't plan on knowing shit
about jail, you feel me?

416
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,393
You wanna talk about jail,
go sit down next to Marcel.

417
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,730
- He just got home.
- True, you right.

418
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,107
Sit your ass down.

419
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:23,201
I know it ain't go good.
That nigger Pooh, he caught me off guard.

420
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,120
- He came at me like he was crazy.
- So you shoot the motherfucker?

421
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,456
I'm saying, it was him or me.

422
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,333
You in our building.

423
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:34,879
You got people on both stairs,
more motherfucking people in the court.

424
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,676
And you got a gun.
So, what I'm trying to figure out is...

425
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:45,306
how the fuck you shoot this nigger in front of
the security booth with them people around?

426
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:48,434
This nigger was coming at me
like he was trying to end me.

427
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:49,727
This ain't about him.

428
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,854
It's about you.

429
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:56,442
You can't play him out of that lobby.
You can't take a beating.

430
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:59,404
So the first thing you do,
you get all emotional.

431
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,615
You pull your gun out,
you do some dumb shit...

432
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,700
that now we got to work around.

433
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,078
I know.

434
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,668
You ain't said
one motherfucking thing I want to hear.

435
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:19,674
You right. You right.
I mean, I gotta start thinking more.

436
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:22,218
You say that all the time and you right.

437
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:25,638
But I'm saying though, I mean...

438
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,516
the shit y'all pulled
with that security lady.

439
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:32,728
It was tight.
I mean, that state lawyer.

440
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:36,023
I ain't never seen
a white woman turn so red.

441
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,192
You should've been there.

442
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:41,195
Yo, man, you family, OK?

443
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:46,075
But that shit cost money.
It cost time and money.

444
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,454
You gonna make that right?

445
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,581
Most def, you gonna see.

446
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:53,791
When I get back to the tower,
I'm gonna push them niggers.

447
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,382
All right.

448
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:05,970
Come here.

449
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,640
Don't walk out of here like that.

450
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,559
You family, all right?

451
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,603
- You know it's always love.
- Yeah.

452
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,624
Type quieter.

453
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,752
You didn't have to wait up, love.

454
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,587
Your boy have a heart attack?

455
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:44,091
No, I went that way but Doc Frazier
didn't bite when this popped up.

456
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,763
- You seriously fucked.
- Speaking of fucked, why are you here?

457
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:51,974
I did bad, Bunk. It wasn't my fault.

458
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:53,809
Really.

459
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,438
Judge Phelan pulled me up
when the jury let the Barksdale kid go.

460
00:30:57,523 --> 00:31:00,858
Him being a judge and all,
I let go of some shit.

461
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:02,985
He raise a stink?

462
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,613
Major got busted by the Deputy Ops

463
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,698
and I gotta have a report by morning.

464
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,992
There you go, giving a fuck

465
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,453
when it ain't your turn
to give a fuck.

466
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,714
Look at 'em, Cole.

467
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,385
Don't it make your dick bust concrete
to be in the same room

468
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:31,681
with two noble, selfless public servants?
I know I'm proud.

469
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,601
Tell me you put this one down.

470
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,815
Of course not. Of course your partner
has to go to the courthouse

471
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:43,442
and lay our business
out in front of a judge.

472
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:44,944
So you heard?

473
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:49,156
Major calls me, says I should get in early,
read over your shoulder.

474
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:55,454
It's got dots. Deputy loves dots.

475
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,498
Fuck you and your dots.

476
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,168
All I did was answer the guy's questions.
He's a fucking judge.

477
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,630
And the deputy's the fucking deputy.

478
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:09,010
And he, not the judge, has what's left
of your beshitted career in his hands.

479
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:13,014
He says so, you're walking foot
in the Western tomorrow.

480
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:17,643
- Fuck it, I came from Western.
- Where don't you want to go, asshole?

481
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,313
Evidence Control? Personnel?

482
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:25,026
- Headquarter Security?
- The boat.

483
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,069
The marine unit?

484
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,780
Yeah, those diesel fumes,
they make me seasick.

485
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,199
That's good, keep it up.

486
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:36,120
I'll go this against 10,
you're riding the boat, midnight shift.

487
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,542
Listen to the man, Jimmy.

488
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:58,851
Yo, Stringer!

489
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,981
- You here early.
- Yeah, I'm on my game today.

490
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:07,610
- Eggy put out testers?
- D...

491
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,739
New deal today.

492
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:15,159
You going out on point,
picking up business in the Pit.

493
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,287
- What?
- You the man in the low-rises.

494
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:22,041
The low-rises?
You got Ronnie Mo in the Pit.

495
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,085
Ronnie Mo got 851 this morning.

496
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,507
Why you put me in the low-rises?
I had a tower since summer.

497
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,300
Yeah, you had a tower.

498
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:36,430
And you might have a tower again
if you can keep your mind to shit.

499
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,265
This is fucked up.

500
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:41,560
You show us you can run the Pit
and you'll be back uptown soon enough.

501
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,691
My uncle know about this?

502
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,444
What do you think?

503
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,198
- Yo, Bey.
- Yo.

504
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,618
Give little cousin here
a ride down the way.

505
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:18,139
- Have your people deal with Daniels.
- Right.

506
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:38,993
You gonna send your man McNulty?
Tell him about chain-of-command.

507
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:41,495
Tell him yourself, he's dead to me.

508
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:19,241
- Yo, you looking for Ronnie Mo, he uptown.
- I know.

509
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,996
You D, right?

510
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:28,667
- Wasn't you in the towers?
- Yeah.

511
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:32,379
Why they put you down here, yo?
You mess with the count or something?

512
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,468
I killed a nigger.

513
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,142
Last call on green top, last call.

514
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,853
Yeah?

515
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:50,272
Major?

516
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:53,609
Counting what we got from the DEA,
how much do we have on this guy?

517
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:57,530
- Lieutenant, I'm holding how many pages?
- Four, sir.

518
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:01,534
- Rawls had a fucking phone book.
- They got ten open murder files.

519
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,954
If we get ten shots at him,
we'd have more than a fat file.

520
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:08,082
- I said that.
- They can't put him down for murder

521
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,377
- so they're getting us to do their work.
- Not getting us, they got us.

522
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,588
- They got you, in fact.
- Excuse me, sir?

523
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,842
Dawson has the York and Cator case,
that leaves you.

524
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:21,512
Shit. Look, set something up
with Homicide

525
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,305
and whoever you want
from your squads.

526
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,267
- State's Attorney?
- Yeah, we should call them too.

527
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,396
Fucking shitstorm.

528
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,316
Lieutenant, line three.

529
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,069
Deputy Ops.

530
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,205
Here we go.

531
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,041
Close that for me.

532
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,379
What's the coffee do?

533
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,674
Give it that money feel,
so it don't seem so white.

534
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,511
Leastways, you got it
on both sides this time.

535
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,179
All right, give me the real.

536
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,062
Wait, why are we gonna use real money?

537
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:15,357
We're not burning no lemon street
chumps here. Feel me?

538
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:18,944
I'm down.

539
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,409
You down? Johnny's down.

540
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,545
- You got that gig.
- Can I get a one-on-one?

541
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,088
Yo, Poot.

542
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,021
Yo, Wallace.

543
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,444
This the way Ronnie Mo set it up?

544
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,363
- Yeah.
- Man, this is fucked up.

545
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,910
You can't serve your customers
straight up after taking they money.

546
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:11,705
Somebody snapping pictures,
they got the whole damn thing.

547
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:16,543
You get paid, you send they ass off
around the building, yo.

548
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,545
Then you serve. All right?

549
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,715
We gotta start tightening up, man.
No more short cuts.

550
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,428
- What's your count?
- I'm up 270.

551
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:31,725
You want to count it.

552
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,062
I don't know how
you do shit up in the towers.

553
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,231
- But down here, you want to count it.
- Shit.

554
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:42,403
Hey, yo, yo, ho, ho, ho!

555
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,739
Y'all niggers been burned.

556
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:49,243
That's what you got to say?

557
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,162
This look like money, motherfucker?

558
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:56,417
Money be green. Money feel like money.

559
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:00,212
- That shit look green to you?
- It got a dead fucking president on it.

560
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,631
I don't give a fuck about the president.

561
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:05,217
- That shit ain't money.
- He ain't no president.

562
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:09,096
- What you mean?
- Hamilton. He ain't no president.

563
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,597
Nigger, is you crazy?

564
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:15,019
No ugly-ass white man get his face
on legal tender except he president.

565
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:19,440
This shit happen again, you off
the money. You hear me?

566
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:21,650
You ain't even gonna be serving.

567
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,612
You be on the end of Vine Street,
sucking on a 40, yelling five-0.

568
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:27,573
You hear me?

569
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,284
Get the fuck outta here.

570
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:34,329
That it?

571
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:36,832
No.

572
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,689
You need to pace that shit, man.

573
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,487
- Johnny, man, you hear me?
- I'm cool.

574
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,364
No, man, you gonna fall out,

575
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:12,785
slamming that shit like that
one of these days, boy.

576
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:20,459
Man, I'm trying to give
you a little game, man...

577
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,087
but you want to pretend
like you know something.

578
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,007
I know a lot, Bubs.

579
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:29,218
No, no, you... you green.

580
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:33,305
I'm trying to get you...
I'm trying to get you brown, man...

581
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,432
but you still green.

582
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,018
You gonna make me brown?

583
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:44,858
Yo, Bubs?

584
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,070
Let me do the scam tomorrow.

585
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,199
Come on, man, I'm ready.

586
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,329
Yo, I'm brown.

587
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:03,377
Shit, man, you ain't even
fucking beige.

588
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,653
- Buy-busts.
- Yes, sir.

589
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:33,740
No long surveillances,
no Kel recorders, no DNRs.

590
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,410
I want to get in and out
as quickly as possible.

591
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,913
- That makes sense.
- Phelan isn't just a judge,

592
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,291
he's a political entity.

593
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,752
If he asks for something,
I want to give it to him.

594
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,255
Why is he asking about
this Barksdale?

595
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:53,343
He watched his state's attorney
get beat up in his court this week.

596
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,847
- Lost a murder case.
- We lose cases all the time.

597
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,600
But a judge happens
to be asking about this one.

598
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,270
- Now, who you using?
- Lead detective?

599
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:06,273
- Greggs, she's my best right now.
- I know her?

600
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,943
CID for four months.
Came over from Eastern DEU.

601
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:14,072
- Who's Homicide sending?
- That's up to Major Rawls.

602
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:17,409
I wouldn't be surprised
if you get McNulty.

603
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,245
- You know McNulty?
- Not really.

604
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:23,290
He mouthed off to the judge
in the first place.

605
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:26,460
- He talked to the judge?
- That's my understanding.

606
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,963
So, if he comes over on this,
watch your back.

607
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:32,382
You need anything, you ask me.

608
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:35,344
I'll give you all the help I can.
But no surprises.

609
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:37,137
Yes, sir.

610
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:39,431
Keep me briefed.

611
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:00,494
- Hi, McNulty, City Homicide.
- Is anyone expecting you?

612
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,080
Yeah, Special Agent Fitzhugh,
Squad Five.

613
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,377
- He's expecting me, can I...?
- Not without an escort.

614
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,004
All right.

615
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:13,006
Agent Fitzhugh to the front.

616
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,731
- Hey, Fitz.
- Hey, brother.

617
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:32,442
- She can spot a bad one.
- Nothing personal.

618
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:35,654
- You know how they are with security.
- I know how they are with locals.

619
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,699
- What's up, G-man?
- Good stuff, brother.

620
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,701
Your man gave us a hell of a case.

621
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,370
Comes to informants, Jimmy,
you can pick 'em.

622
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,163
He's one of the better CI's
I've ever worked.

623
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:47,874
- You up on a wire?
- That and more.

624
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:54,047
So, like, he be talking like
he got some kind of record deal.

625
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:57,426
- Man, please.
- That nigger.

626
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,763
- The pussy has you.
- Jesus Christ.

627
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,891
- Pretty fucking great, huh?
- How'd you get this on tape?

628
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:08,103
That's not tape.
That's live, brother.

629
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:10,897
That's live?

630
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:14,067
Live from a three-story walk-up
on Homer Avenue

631
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,777
in the bottoms of Pimlico.

632
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:18,530
- This is going on right now?
- As we speak.

633
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,033
- How?
- Fiber-optic lensing.

634
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:25,370
Camera's behind a hole in the wall.
So small it looks like a nail might've made it.

635
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:28,206
Where's the mic?
These fuckers sound great.

636
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:31,168
Two remotes behind
the baseboard heating ducts.

637
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:34,171
That's about 3K of raw on the table today.

638
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:37,257
- We followed it from New York.
- You're up in New York on this?

639
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,092
We could be.

640
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,595
We're backing into some
Dominicans up there.

641
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,264
We could have a Title three on 'em
right now if we wanted.

642
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:46,767
Wrong war, brother.

643
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,436
Most of the squad's
gone to counterterrorism.

644
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,855
This is the last drug case pending.

645
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,024
I gotta shut it down
by the end of the month.

646
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,985
- You guys are getting out of drugs?
- Yeah, for a while.

647
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,529
We don't have the manpower
to stay on anything big.

648
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,198
Not since those towers fell.

649
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,326
We don't have enough love
in our hearts for two wars?

650
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:09,289
- Joke's on us, huh?
- I guess so, still...

651
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:13,001
You give great case.
I wish you could've worked it with us.

652
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:32,479
Got some Tech Nine over here.
Tech Nine.

653
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,406
That's it, here's 20, hook it up.

654
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,367
Two and two.

655
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,785
- Hold up.
- What?

656
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,871
- Just two and two.
- Come on, man, I ain't got time for this.

657
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,082
- I gave you 20, man.
- You gave me 20?

658
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,543
- One and a short three.
- So you get, two...

659
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,294
- Seven!
- Hold up.

660
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:59,589
- I get seven back. Come on, man.
- Calm down.

661
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:04,094
Hold up, hold up, you
fucking me up. Chill out.

662
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:09,266
You dropping shit on the ground?

663
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,810
- Hold up.
- I ain't got all day.

664
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,438
Come on, man, it's easy.
Let's rewind, man.

665
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:18,483
What the fuck is you doing?
Look at this shit. Look, nigger.

666
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:20,485
- That's the motherfucker.
- Who?

667
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:23,363
The white boy right there.
Poot, grab that motherfucker.

668
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:25,782
The white boy.

669
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:27,909
- D, man!
- Hold up, man.

670
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:30,537
Hey!

671
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:40,464
Hey! Stop that white motherfucker.

672
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:44,301
Yeah, motherfucker, yeah, nigger.
Fuck that.

673
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:46,136
What are you doing, man?

674
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,804
Calm down, man.

675
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:49,973
Making me run,
what is wrong with you?

676
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,976
- What, man, why you fucking with me?
- Shit.

677
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,353
This the motherfucker
with the make-believe money.

678
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,230
Seen his ass drop it and shit.

679
00:46:57,398 --> 00:47:00,108
- Wasn't me.
- Motherfucker.

680
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,403
It was this nigger, I saw him.
Get the fuck up.

681
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,283
- All right, listen, I'm sorry.
- Fuck that.

682
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:12,496
Motherfucker burned us for $30.
Take him to Franklin Avenue

683
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,789
and throw his ass onto
the motherfucking expressway.

684
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:19,586
All right, listen, I'm fucking sorry.
I fucked up, man.

685
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,923
- What you got on you?
- Just the 10 I dropped, man, the real one.

686
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:42,484
Well?! What's up?

687
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:52,953
Fuck it.

688
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:58,124
Hell, yeah.

689
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:07,801
We'll work out of Narcotics,
with Kima keeping the file.

690
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:10,470
We'll copy everything to Ronnie
at the courthouse.

691
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:12,389
Fine with us.

692
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:16,017
McNulty and Santangelo will work
on the open murders.

693
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,896
Kima and my people will do
hand-to-hand stuff in the Terrace.

694
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:21,231
Buy-bust, quick and dirty.

695
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:24,568
We put years over top of some
of these people, we'll roll a few.

696
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:29,155
You're not gonna get Avon Barksdale
or Stringer Bell on street rips.

697
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,533
- You don't know that.
- These guys are good.

698
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:34,744
They've got everyone running scared.

699
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:36,162
What do you suggest?

700
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:39,916
Surveillance teams,
DNRs, asset investigation.

701
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:41,918
Gather string till we find a way in.

702
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:45,130
Either a wired CI or a Title three.
That's what makes this case.

703
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:46,631
Is that what you told the judge?

704
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:50,927
OK, so I'm an asshole for that.
But I'm right about this much.

705
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,890
No mics, no wires.
We do this fast and clean and simple.

706
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:58,101
- Then you don't do it at all.
- What the...?

707
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:02,272
You could've had this fight before
calling the State's Attorney's office.

708
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:06,359
Let me ask you something.
What do we know about Avon Barksdale?

709
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:08,403
What do we know?

710
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:11,865
The guy's owned
all of Franklin Terrace for a year.

711
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:14,993
What do we have on him right now?
A DOB? A sheet?

712
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:17,162
A B of I photo?

713
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:19,956
We don't have a fucking
photo of the guy.

714
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:21,666
Gimme a break, Jimmy.

715
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:24,753
Two days ago no one
on this fucking floor knew his name.

716
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:26,963
Now he's some criminal mastermind.

717
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:30,508
Shit, I say we go to the Terrace
and fuck some people up.

718
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:35,388
You don't need a prosecutor,
you need a fucking referee.

719
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:37,557
When you know
how you're playing this, yell.

720
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:39,100
We know how we're playing it.

721
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:41,853
My people are going down
to do hand-to-hands.

722
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:46,316
Detectives McNulty and Santangelo
are going to review old murder files

723
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,526
and try to make a fresh prosecution.

724
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:53,239
I'll get us more manpower
but this case is not going to sprawl.

725
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,534
A month from now,
we're all gonna be back at our day jobs.

726
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:59,120
Fine.
Bring me your hand-to-hands.

727
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:03,625
Anything on the murders, take to Ilene Nathan
in violent crimes. I'll clue her in.

728
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:09,464
Anything else?

729
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,426
One last thing.

730
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:18,348
No one does anything on the street
without me knowing about it first.

731
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,227
Chain-of-command, Detective.

732
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:25,188
That's how we do things
down this end of the hall.

733
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:34,030
If she's fucking you on visitation,
take her ass to court.

734
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:38,618
Judge gives me three weekends out of four,
I still need her to cooperate.

735
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:41,121
You know, move it around,

736
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:44,499
so when I have to work through
a weekend, she switches.

737
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,962
The judge gives me three weekends
but no flex, I still lose.

738
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:52,298
- You two can't talk this through?
- No.

739
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:57,095
How is it you always got
the whole world pissed off at you?

740
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,558
You know Daniels? Narcotics?

741
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:04,436
- What about him?
- He's running this detail.

742
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:08,189
- Watch your ass then.
- He a snake?

743
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:12,068
No, he ain't that.
But he's a company man.

744
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:14,279
You know, a prospect.

745
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:17,490
Grapevine says the next district
to open up is his.

746
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,367
Shortlist for major?

747
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:23,204
He's black, still young,
he hasn't pissed anybody off.

748
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:26,082
- Shit, he even has a law degree.
- No shit.

749
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:30,587
- University of Baltimore, but still.
- He's gonna fuck this Barksdale thing up.

750
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,840
- How's that?
- Buy-bust?

751
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:38,094
- He's pissing in the wind.
- You already fucked it up, Jimmy.

752
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:39,846
You made it happen.

753
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:45,143
I feel like that motherfucker
at the end of Bridge On The River Kwai.

754
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:48,772
- What the fuck did I do?
- The bridge of what?

755
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,232
You ain't seen that movie?

756
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,235
I am fucked.

757
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,699
Fucked is me.

758
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:05,079
God damn it, you gonna make me
go another round.

759
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,040
Two more.

760
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:21,179
- It's all in the game.
- It was only a couple of dollars.

761
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,640
- It ain't the money.
- But we fucked him up bad.

762
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:25,767
It's the message, D.

763
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:29,229
You can't show no weakness.

764
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:32,398
- Still, I'm saying.
- What?

765
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,745
String. Yo, Stringer!

766
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,051
<i>Operate around the clock</i>

767
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,804
<i>Why don't you come in?</i>

768
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:09,769
You ain't touched that drink.
You want some company?

769
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:13,898
- I ain't no john.
- Good, 'cause I ain't no whore.

770
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,193
I'm not a regular, OK?

771
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:20,238
- I work for Stringer.
- He pay you, don't he?

772
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,783
Come on, buy me a drink.

773
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:28,454
- How much?
- 20.

774
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:32,250
I drink slow.

775
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:38,756
Maybe another time.

776
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,733
- Buy me a drink, honey?
- How about you buy me a drink?

777
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,821
Carla. One here.

778
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,137
Hey.

779
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,598
- Where you at?
- Where you think?

780
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:35,229
- You late for work?
- A little.

781
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,860
- How much you got left?
- Girl, please.

782
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:45,365
- Ten pages and all the footnotes.
- When's it due?

783
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,951
Tomorrow, beginning of class.

784
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,416
Long night for you.

785
00:54:58,087 --> 00:54:59,712
Long night for me.

786
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,720
I'll pick up some coffee.

787
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:20,024
So, I drive all the way
down to Liberty Road

788
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:23,277
at two in the damn morning,
on a midnight shift.

789
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:26,531
I got two murders and a police shooting
going down, to do what?

790
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:30,576
To get a goddamn mouse out of
my wife's closet. Can you imagine that shit?

791
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,413
So what did you do?

792
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:38,543
What the fuck you think?
I got the mouse out and drove back to work.

793
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,628
Couldn't do nothing else.

794
00:55:42,131 --> 00:55:45,425
Nadine out of her mind
over this little-ass field mouse.

795
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:49,429
She's up on the chair and shit
like some goddamn cartoon.

796
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:53,725
- How did you catch the mouse?
- Catch him? I lit his ass up.

797
00:55:56,729 --> 00:55:59,981
You shot the mouse? With your nine?

798
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:02,900
First shot killed my wife's dress shoe.

799
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,944
Got him with the second.

800
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:13,661
What?

801
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:17,206
You shot a mouse
with your service weapon?

802
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,624
Yeah.

803
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:23,046
- What'd you do with the carcass?
- I cleaned it up, you know.

804
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:27,133
I thought about leaving that little
motherfucker as a warning to others.

805
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:36,934
Fuck me.

806
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:45,151
It's 3:30 in the morning.
I'm supposed to be early relief.

807
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:49,280
Jimmy, man, I gotta change
my clothes at least, come on.

808
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:52,325
I'm gonna do this case.

809
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:56,370
What?

810
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:59,665
I'm gonna do this case
the way it should be done.

811
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:02,418
It's a buy-bust, get in and get out.

812
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:04,378
- Fuck that.
- Jimmy.

813
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,390
Let's call it a night.

814
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:42,125
Hi, Bubs.

815
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:45,962
Thought you was still locked up.

816
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:48,422
Nope.

817
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,301
How long you been home?

818
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:55,179
It's been three months.

819
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:59,267
You don't write, you don't call.

820
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:03,604
Who's he?

821
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:06,941
A friend.

822
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:11,154
Is he gonna make it?

823
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,162
You still working drugs?

824
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:24,167
Downtown, yeah.

825
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,379
I got something for you.

826
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:43,102
- Last call!
- Fuck.

827
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:47,190
Found body. 200, Block Amity.

828
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,275
I'm a little thin today, boss.

829
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:53,613
The whole squad's a little thin,
remember?

830
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:57,909
We're down a man since
your partner got himself detailed.

831
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:02,788
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

832
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:05,708
I got it.

833
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:17,803
Jesus.

834
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:38,407
- How you doing, Bobby?
- Bunk, what's going on, man?

835
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:40,785
We got one or two shots to the head.

836
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:43,329
No witnesses, no suspects.

837
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:46,207
A .380 casing on the ground there.

838
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:48,167
Do me a favor, bag that for me.

839
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:54,090
- So, who called it in?
- No one. 21 Post found him.

840
00:59:54,591 --> 01:00:00,721
It's a William Gant, 42, no, 43 years old.
Address on Schroeder.

841
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:02,807
- You got pictures?
- Yeah.

842
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,642
OK, let's roll him.

843
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:14,527
Mr. Gant, do you see the man
you identified sitting in the courtroom today?

844
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:17,530
He's right there.
