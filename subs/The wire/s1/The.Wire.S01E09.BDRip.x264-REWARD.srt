1
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,728
Him on the ball, from Dunbar.

2
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:26,275
He junior college now, but he going to
bigger places if he can make them grades.

3
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,532
He our edge, right there.

4
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,120
- Where he going?
- I don't know.

5
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:41,499
Terps, Hoyas, Missouri, Kansas,
they all want this cat.

6
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,253
So we in the mix too now.
You know what I'm talking about?

7
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,048
Proposition Joe ain't got
nobody balling like this.

8
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,467
He better not have one
motherfucker like this.

9
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,761
I'm tired of losing to
these Eastside bitches.

10
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:58,099
It's been three years running now, man.
Fucking with my morale, for real.

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,854
What happened to the faggot?

12
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,772
Omar?

13
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:08,693
- That nigger in the wind, man.
- What you mean he in the wind, man?

14
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,778
This city ain't that big.

15
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:15,783
You know what that nigger do
when he holed up somewhere?

16
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:20,204
He peel off one or two packages,
roll around the neighborhood

17
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,373
giving away free vials and shit.

18
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:26,711
On some real Robin Hood type shit.
If we try and get at him,

19
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,714
we gonna have two dozen niggers
saying that we on our way.

20
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,759
If you want us to hunt that nigger,
we gonna hunt.

21
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:37,472
But the smart play, I think,
we call a truce,

22
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:41,768
put this thing on hold for a hot second,
let the faggot get comfortable,

23
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,729
and when he do, he'll pop up his head,
boom, we got him.

24
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:48,708
What motherfuckers gonna be saying
while we waiting?

25
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:53,529
What people gonna say when they see
this cocksucking faggot out in the sunshine?

26
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,324
Like it ain't no thing
to take my shit.

27
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,460
- Kid's everything I said he was, huh?
- Yeah, he's straight.

28
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,463
Don't know what we're gonna do
without him.

29
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,633
- How come you ain't signed?
- Lot of schools looking at me.

30
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,803
- I'm listening.
- Ten large, though, that ain't bad.

31
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:21,307
- It ain't.
- Well, ten for the kid, plus five.

32
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,435
Donation for the program.

33
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,479
Done.

34
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,816
Good. Give me 30 from the line
and get out of here.

35
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,486
- Yo, man, good job, baby.
- All right.

36
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:40,159
And I assume there's another five right here,
for making this happen?

37
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,662
Ain't shit for free, right?

38
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:57,510
<i>If you walk through the garden</i>

39
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,929
<i>You'd better watch your back</i>

40
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,642
<i>But I beg your pardon</i>

41
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,603
<i>Walk the straight
and narrow track</i>

42
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,774
<i>If you walk with Jesus</i>

43
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:16,320
<i>He'll save your soul</i>

44
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,407
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

45
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,493
<i>Down in the hole</i>

46
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,998
<i>All the angels sing</i>

47
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,501
<i>About Jesus' mighty sword</i>

48
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,547
<i>And they shield you
with their wings</i>

49
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,551
<i>Keep you close to the Lord</i>

50
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,971
<i>Don't pay heed to temptation</i>

51
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:46,559
<i>For his hands are so cold</i>

52
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,021
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

53
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,983
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

54
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,535
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

55
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,456
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

56
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,419
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

57
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,589
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

58
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,598
So, what you do for money?
Can't live without it, right?

59
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,434
You still fucked up
behind that stick-up, man?

60
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,355
Shit ain't on you.
It ain't on me neither.

61
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,399
Motherfucker who robbed
the stash shot Sterling.

62
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,736
He gonna get got
no matter what you or me do.

63
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,531
I just don't wanna play.
I don't wanna play no more. All right?

64
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,952
I was thinking about going to school,
over at Edmondson,

65
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,954
ask if they'll let me back in.

66
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,539
- What grade?
- Ninth.

67
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:54,543
- Ninth? Shit, you how old?
- 16.

68
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,880
Damn, man, you supposed
to be a junior by now.

69
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,716
I heard Stinkum got killed.

70
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,843
Yeah.

71
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,722
Damn.

72
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:16,857
- Yo, I said I don't wanna play.
- I heard you.

73
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,484
And you ain't got to do nothing.

74
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,778
I heard you. Take it.

75
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,489
Hurry up, nigger.
People looking.

76
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,659
Look here, man,
you a smart little motherfucker.

77
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,328
You start back up at Edmondson,

78
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:33,457
you likely to finish up at Harvard
or some shit like that. Believe, B.

79
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:38,504
And you...
you got a good heart in there too.

80
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,589
Not like the rest of these niggers.

81
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,518
- Yeah?
- Ronnie Mo on Tower Phone 2.

82
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,978
Right.

83
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,605
Yo, you coming to get this shit?

84
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,482
Keep cool. We making rounds.

85
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:02,278
- You know I ain't moving like I used to.
- Couple of hours, we be at you.

86
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,696
All right.

87
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,699
Wee-Bey picking up at the towers?

88
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,953
- In a couple hours, give or take.
- Time enough for us to make a play.

89
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,585
- What's up with Wallace?
- Nothing.

90
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,672
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

91
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,716
It's all good, just leave him be.

92
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,557
Damn.

93
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,726
Fuck.

94
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:38,355
I'm tired of not having
a phone up in this joint.

95
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,733
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

96
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,277
- Have a nice hike.
- Yeah.

97
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,585
- You make order?
- Who this?

98
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,046
You make order? Good yakame.

99
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,256
- What?
- Or no delivery.

100
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,843
You make order, you come get.
Good yakame, good noodle.

101
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,428
Extra ketchup.

102
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,892
What the fuck was that?

103
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,394
That was my Korean counterman.

104
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,979
Sounded Chinese.

105
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,859
Like you can fucking tell
the difference.

106
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,701
It's a brave new world
for you, boys.

107
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,623
- 12-14.
- 12-14.

108
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,459
- Request a lateral with 12-08.
- Go ahead, 14.

109
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:43,879
- 08, can you go to Channel 3?
- 12-08, I got that.

110
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,217
- Where you at?
- McCullough above Preston.

111
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,053
On a good pay phone
that the Pit boys are now using.

112
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,764
I'm up on the church.
Hang close, boys.

113
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,809
Might have a nice jack-up
for you two.

114
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,818
I can't believe
you boys still in business.

115
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,238
- Testers coming in five.
- What's the new package, man?

116
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,532
Yellow tops.
This shit is the bomb.

117
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,451
- Shit is the bomb.
- Check it.

118
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,204
A man who wants to get high
more than clean.

119
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,166
- He was doing good too.
- That shit was bullshit.

120
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,919
- Them meetings were just fronts.
- The man sounded strong.

121
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,379
Whatever.

122
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,339
It's about that time.

123
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,466
- Shit.
- What happened?

124
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:32,970
That's the boy
who beat me down, man.

125
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:37,600
Hey, yo. The shits right here
is yellow tops and they right,

126
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:42,021
so remember where you caught this blast
and tell your fiend-ass friends.

127
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,190
Line the fuck up.

128
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,649
Back up.

129
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,944
Get in line, what the fuck?
Line the fuck up.

130
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,656
Get the fuck out of here.
Fuck y'all.

131
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,491
There you go!

132
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,536
Hurry up. Over here.

133
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:01,332
Get one, girl, over here.
I got one, I got one.

134
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,752
- You get one?
- I got one.

135
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:08,631
Yo, hold up. Hey. Hey.
You catch one?

136
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,258
You know,
I got three if you need.

137
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,969
You was at the meeting
over at Samuel Morse.

138
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:18,933
- Mr. One-Day Man. It wasn't even that.
- Stood up, though.

139
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,060
Why you at the tester line
if you ain't chasing?

140
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,270
Trying to get my nephew
off the corner.

141
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:28,984
His mama sent him up to Cumberland.
Try to keep him clean at my grandma's.

142
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:33,948
He ain't anywhere near his bottom.
Got to see that bottom coming up at him.

143
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,742
Hard too, cos he's young, 24.

144
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,995
Most people don't get tired
till they're 35, 40.

145
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,749
- How old are you?
- Young at heart.

146
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,544
Waylon, man.

147
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,880
Bubs.

148
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,686
Give them a long rope. The farther away
from the projects, the less risk to the wire.

149
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,563
- Hell with the wire.
- Excuse me?

150
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,400
Gotcha, McNulty, you're too easy.

151
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,076
You can come at this a few ways.

152
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,454
First thing is we need the names
of all front companies,

153
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,915
limited partnerships, LLCs,
and all that mess.

154
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,751
- LLCs?
- Limited liability corporations.

155
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,087
Start with the nightclub
which Barksdale owns.

156
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:34,883
Look up Orlando's, by address, you match it,
and you see it's owned by who?

157
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,177
It's on Baltimore Street, right?

158
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,645
Got it.
D&B enterprises.

159
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,981
Hand it over to Prez
who's gonna get off his ass

160
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,984
and walk over to the state
office buildings on Preston Street.

161
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,361
- Preston Street?
- Corporate charter office.

162
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,071
Corporate who?

163
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,366
They have the paperwork
on every corporation and LLC

164
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,368
licensed to do business
in the state.

165
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:05,914
Look up D&B Enterprises on the computer.
You're going to get a little reel of microfilm.

166
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:11,837
Pull the corporate charter papers that way.
Write down every name you see.

167
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,466
Corporate officers, shareholders
or, more importantly,

168
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,303
the resident agent on the filing
who is usually a lawyer.

169
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,598
While they use front names
as corporate officers,

170
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,642
they usually use the same lawyer
to do the charter filing.

171
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,437
Find that agent's name,
run it through the computer,

172
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,523
find out what other corporations
he's done the filing for,

173
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,567
and that way we find
other front companies.

174
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,861
While he's doing that,
what do I do?

175
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,489
Keep your head in this
assessment book.

176
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:41,742
Look up any properties
that you can connect to Barksdale.

177
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,869
How do you know it connects
to Barksdale?

178
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,873
You work off what Prez gets you
from the corporate charter documents.

179
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,543
Whatever companies he links to Barksdale
or people connected to him,

180
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,921
look for those companies
in the city land records.

181
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,215
For example,

182
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,301
McNulty said that he heard
that Barksdale owned

183
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,970
an apartment building up
on Druid Park Lake.

184
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,473
Look up all the blocks
on Reservoir Hill.

185
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,351
See if there's anything
owned by D&B Enterprises

186
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:11,939
or any other company that Prez finds
through corporate charter or anything similar.

187
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:15,943
If you find something that fits,
you write down the folio number,

188
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,445
so you can look it up later
at the courthouse.

189
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,072
You don't find anything,

190
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:24,326
take the names of all the corporate listings
for the multi-units near the lake.

191
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:28,163
You call that list over to Prez,
who pulls the charter papers,

192
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,207
and he'll look for connections.

193
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:34,253
- This is like a scavenger hunt.
- But what if Barksdale is careful?

194
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:37,131
What if we can't find
his name on anything?

195
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:41,218
In this country, somebody's name
has got to be on a piece of paper.

196
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,596
A cousin, a girlfriend,
a grandmother, a lieutenant he can trust.

197
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:48,350
Somebody's name is on a piece of paper.
And here's the rub.

198
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,481
You follow drugs,
you get drug addicts and drug dealers.

199
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,650
But you start to follow the money

200
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,778
and you don't know where
the fuck it's gonna take you.

201
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:03,991
While we're running around on this,
what are you gonna do?

202
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,371
- You need something?
- Yeah.

203
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:14,460
Let me get the campaign financial reports
for the western districts

204
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,628
and, actually, any citywide race.

205
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,548
Quarterly reports or
individual donor lists?

206
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:23,302
- Both, please.
- It'll be a couple of hundred pages.

207
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,679
Really? I'll take all of it.

208
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,229
What the fuck, man?

209
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,029
With your right hand,
reach for the window and open the door.

210
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,115
- Hurry up, man.
- Step out of the car.

211
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,244
Drop the cane, toss the cane.
Come around to the back.

212
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,249
Turn around.

213
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,670
Sir, is there anything in the vehicle
we should know about?

214
00:13:58,755 --> 00:13:59,922
Nope.

215
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,591
No guns, drugs?

216
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,097
Me ain't got shit.

217
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:21,109
This money right here,
I didn't just pull this out of your truck?

218
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:22,986
What money?

219
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:29,368
- We'll be counting this limp-dick cash all day.
- Where you guys going with this?

220
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,120
Like the man said, it ain't ours.

221
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:36,124
It ain't yours? So, you don't mind
if we just take it off your hands?

222
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,127
Do what you feel.
You pretending to take money.

223
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,798
- I didn't even know it was there.
- I know how that shit is.

224
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,218
The other day, I took up
the sofa cushions off my couch

225
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,971
and found $1.40
I didn't even know was there.

226
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,351
You all ain't got no charge, right?

227
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:02,234
No, fucker, we do not have a charge.
We just got your money.

228
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:06,530
You want it back, you can explain it
to the state's attorney where you got it.

229
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,787
Y'all enjoy your day now,
you hear?

230
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,456
<i>As I wake up in the morning
and get out of my bed...</i>

231
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,501
- <i>I'm thinkin' about the brothers...</i>
- Give me three.

232
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,421
<i>The brothers I deal with,
locked up</i>

233
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,660
<i>As I wake up in the morning
and get out of my bed</i>

234
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,663
<i>I'm thinkin' about the people
I grew up with, long dead</i>

235
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,041
<i>The brothers I grew up with,
locked up</i>

236
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,834
<i>I'm freestylin' off
the top of my head</i>

237
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,878
<i>You know it's swell,
Patti LaBelle</i>

238
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,464
<i>I like her but
Regina Belle is better...</i>

239
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,563
Motherfucker!

240
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,698
Yo, motherfucker,
trying to steal our shit.

241
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,085
Motherfucker!

242
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,339
Fished your wish, Bubs?

243
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,299
Oh, yeah.

244
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,928
And you should've seen
the one that got away.

245
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:00,894
You know, I nearly got killed
behind this caper.

246
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,069
It's all in the game, Bubs.

247
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,822
Yeah?

248
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,689
Yo, Bub...

249
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,317
This ain't shit.

250
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,363
I'm not high, neither.

251
00:17:55,783 --> 00:18:00,078
It's fucking Arm & Hammer.
We just been firing baking soda.

252
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:04,374
Fuck. It's all right.
I'll just come up with another plan.

253
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,626
I did it once, right?

254
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,985
Fuck me.

255
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,459
Carv, you go to a restaurant,

256
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,629
and say the waitress gives you
good, decent service.

257
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,632
- How much do you tip?
- How much do I tip?

258
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,931
- For good service.
- I don't know, 15%.

259
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:05,018
- Some people tip 20.
- Some people got money.

260
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,897
How much you think
Wee-Bey would tip?

261
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,651
You'd be a clever motherfucker
if there wasn't a wiretap running.

262
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,736
What do you mean?

263
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:26,039
Say we turn in 20, and this afternoon
the bosses are listening to the wiretap

264
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,500
and they hear we took 30
out of that car.

265
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,422
Didn't think of that, did you?

266
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,759
We're finding stuff
on the west side of downtown

267
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,887
that might be his over by
that Howard Street corridor.

268
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:45,600
- What kind of property?
- Low-rent commercials. A lot of vacants.

269
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:49,145
What does Avon Barksdale want
with a string of empty storefronts?

270
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,065
- This feels premature.
- What does?

271
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,443
Chasing up assets. We're not close
to putting a charge to the man.

272
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,196
- That should be the priority.
- We put a charge to him,

273
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:00,866
the deputy shuts us down,
tells us to go home.

274
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,202
You want the money side of this case,
it's now or never.

275
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,349
I'm working here.

276
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,752
- Maybe 20 or 30.
- Dollars for donuts.

277
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,299
You should've seen the looks
on their faces.

278
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,593
- What did Wee-Bey say?
- What money?

279
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,846
The only hassle is we need
to count this shit.

280
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,892
- Do the ECU Submissions.
- It's all limp-dick, dime-vial money.

281
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,352
Dirty bills right off the corner.

282
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,855
You all got the Pit boys
on a fresh payphone?

283
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,940
- On McCullough.
- You take pictures?

284
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:37,360
We're gonna need an additional affidavit
to get up on that phone.

285
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,654
Another 30 days, McNulty?

286
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,911
What the fuck did I do?

287
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,413
One day he fights,
next he's ready to roll over.

288
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:53,043
- Does he want this fucking case or not?
- Give him some slack.

289
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,171
He's wrestling with
the angels on this one.

290
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,298
Where's my lucky pen?

291
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,792
- You ready, bitch?
- I'm ready.

292
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,962
I wanna get on my knees
and suck you like a big lollipop.

293
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,839
- Suck it.
- I know that's your favorite.

294
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,634
Let me lick that.
You like that?

295
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,305
I want you to butt-fuck me...

296
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,934
We're supposed to turn off the tap
when it's non-pertinent.

297
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,811
Fuck, no, this is too good.

298
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:56,439
- Fuck me.
- Ooh, Daddy, yeah.

299
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,817
There's no way
I'm transcribing this stuff.

300
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,319
Touch yourself.

301
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:05,615
- Oh, yeah. My pussy is so wet right now.
- Phone sex?

302
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:08,076
Shit was hilarious.

303
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:11,329
You're supposed to shut down
if it's non-pertinent.

304
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:16,001
- You're gonna look like a glazed donut.
- Is that right?

305
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,920
I'm gonna get there and fuck you
in all three holes.

306
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,051
- You're gonna come past?
- Tomorrow, yeah.

307
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:28,930
But I need to go past Argyle Street tonight,
check in with Wallace.

308
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,976
He off the hook since we helped
the tower crew get that stick-up boy.

309
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,439
Wallace is bugging. Don't hardly even
come out of that room no more.

310
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:41,443
- Why he be like that?
- I think he might be getting high.

311
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,529
- Boy is scaring me.
- You holler at me later.

312
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,614
That'll work.

313
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,616
Pertinent now, right?

314
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:52,829
It is if you can explain why we're on
the line after 10 minutes jerking off.

315
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,914
You gotta justify that.

316
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:59,085
Maybe three holes was the code
for three stash houses.

317
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,634
Omar!

318
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,470
Yo!

319
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:12,015
Omar coming, Omar coming!

320
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,060
- Did you hear me? Omar coming.
- Let's get out of here.

321
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:19,564
- Close that shit down.
- I said, Omar coming through.

322
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,900
Somebody in trouble now.
Let's go.

323
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:50,095
Y'all need to open this door, man,
before I huff and puff.

324
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,349
By the hairs of your
chinny-chin-chin.

325
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,143
You best roll out.
We up in here with a MAC-10.

326
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:59,395
I thinks not, Terrell,
I thinks not.

327
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:03,733
Y'all might need to think this through
and stop wasting my time.

328
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,653
Because Omar can come back
tomorrow.

329
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:08,738
And the next day.

330
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:12,367
And the next day.

331
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:16,830
And I will put a bullet in all y'all behind,
what happen right now, you heard?

332
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,311
Fair enough.

333
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,816
Here you go, keep it.

334
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,068
How do you wanna play it?

335
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,988
Hard and tight,
like she's got no choice.

336
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:53,533
- Shardene Ennis.
- Miss, we need to talk.

337
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,952
- About what?
- It's a downtown talk.

338
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,705
This way. Come on. Come on.

339
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,957
Two at a time! Two at a time!

340
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,420
Give me a two and two.

341
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,023
- Yo, what's up?
- What you got?

342
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,483
Family affair,
two-for-one, you up?

343
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,612
- Nah, not me.
- All right.

344
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:44,292
How you figure all these little pebbles
get up on top of the roof?

345
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,921
Where's everybody at?

346
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:51,591
Maybe the whole thing is over
and no one bothered to tell us.

347
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,676
Maybe we won.

348
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,392
Something ain't right.

349
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,603
Come on, let's take a ride.

350
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,108
I like these.

351
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,485
Yeah?

352
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:14,447
- The toy furniture is great.
- Doll house miniatures.

353
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,075
It's a hobby.

354
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:22,914
My sister had a doll house when we were
young, but nothing as nice as these. Can I?

355
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,832
Sure, babe.

356
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,670
That's a walnut marble-top vanity.

357
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,175
Renaissance revival,
late 19th century.

358
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,971
Do you have a house for them?

359
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,640
No, I just make them and sell them.

360
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,185
That seems kind of sad.

361
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,354
You should have a house for them.

362
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,488
We can use the Lieutenant's office.

363
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:21,139
- No.
- I ain't asked for nothing.

364
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:26,978
What's up, Tasha?
You got too pretty, girl.

365
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,063
Go inside, Tash.

366
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,906
I'm thinking...

367
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:42,118
Thinking about getting
clean again.

368
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,624
I was thinking I ain't got
no other place to go, maybe...

369
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,003
That's wrong, right?

370
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,589
That ain't right, right?
Sorry.

371
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,717
I'm sorry.

372
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:01,012
Wait.

373
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,277
Back door only.

374
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:20,740
There's an old sofa in the basement.
I'll throw you down some blankets.

375
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:27,038
You try to come up those stairs,
and I'm gonna call the police. I swear I will.

376
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:43,262
West fucking Baltimore
is on vacation.

377
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:46,265
No crews slinging in the
low-rises, the towers.

378
00:28:58,695 --> 00:28:59,946
What the fuck?

379
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,379
- Who's playing who?
- West against East.

380
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,882
- Baltimore?
- The projects, man.

381
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:22,009
The bragging rights to the projects.

382
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:26,848
The projects got a ball team?

383
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,238
How long you been working
at Orlando's?

384
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,449
- Four or five months.
- You like it?

385
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,702
- Pays the rent.
- You must see a lot there, I imagine.

386
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,747
- What do you mean?
- There's a lot of game being played.

387
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:53,875
I just work for tips.

388
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:56,294
- For tips?
- Tips, drinks.

389
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,547
I'm just a b-girl.
I don't mess with nothing beyond that.

390
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,717
Some of the girls in there,
they're into drugs.

391
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:07,680
Some of them turn tricks in the rooms
upstairs but I mostly just stay at the bar.

392
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:13,853
It's rare when we ask somebody
to come downtown with us, with no charge,

393
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:17,482
we don't tell them what we're gonna talk
about, and they come without complaining.

394
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:20,568
- That hardly ever happens.
- Rarely, if ever.

395
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:24,989
- I figure you got your reasons.
- The crew that runs Orlando's.

396
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,408
They've dropped about a dozen bodies
over the last year.

397
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:32,663
They're running the drugs in every housing
project west of the Martin Luther King.

398
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,500
I don't know anything about that.
I just work for tips.

399
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:37,919
Now you do know,
because we're telling you.

400
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,546
You know a girl named
Keisha Michaels?

401
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,591
- She dances with me.
- How's she doing?

402
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,177
All right, I guess.

403
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,888
Will you excuse us a moment?

404
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,777
- So, what do you think?
- I think she's a sweetheart.

405
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:07,782
If we push her hard, she'll tumble.
You want to show her the pictures?

406
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,742
I want to do better than that.

407
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,931
Come on, man, play defense.

408
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,808
- Let's go!
- D-up, B.

409
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:37,895
- Who is he?
- That's Marcus Rivera, man.

410
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,899
He out of Lake Clifton.
That nigger played in Italy and shit.

411
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:48,030
Yo, Slim. What's up, man? You got to go
all the way to Europe to get you a ringer?

412
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,160
He home now. But I see you
pulling boys out the junior colleges.

413
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:55,162
He from Eastside, went to Dunbar.

414
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,915
Playboy, how come
you wearing that suit?

415
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,002
It's 85 fucking degrees
and you trying to be like Pat Riley.

416
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,212
Look the part, be the part,
motherfucker.

417
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:07,008
You got a fake fucking clipboard.
You can't even read a playbook.

418
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,427
Be for real. Bunch of bitches.

419
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,103
Yeah!

420
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,856
- Let's go.
- That was nice.

421
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,108
That boy was talking to God, right?

422
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,324
Ain't y'all on the clock?

423
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,951
- Ain't you?
- We on a break.

424
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:37,872
Then we on a break too.
What's up with this game?

425
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,876
Just something we do every year.
Eastside versus Westside niggers.

426
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,046
Loser gotta throw a big-ass party
at Druid Hill next week.

427
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:48,466
- Who's favored?
- Eastside won the last two years.

428
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,217
My boys.

429
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:55,556
Found nude Monday morning,
in a dumpster off Reisterstown Road.

430
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,893
Toxicology is positive
for heroin and cocaine.

431
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:05,608
- In a dumpster?
- Rolled up in a rug.

432
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:09,987
She overdosed and whoever was with her
just rolled her up and threw her away.

433
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,530
That's how they do.

434
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,700
Positive for semen in vaginal,
anal and oral cavities.

435
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:19,914
- Three different blood types, all secretors.
- They fucked her and threw her away.

436
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,042
The only reason we knew who she was
or what she was about

437
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,711
or what she might mean
to someone like you

438
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:29,924
is because we've been keeping an eye
on the people who run Orlando's.

439
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,386
We got ways of knowing
what they're saying, thinking.

440
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:38,557
- You know what they said about this one?
- Bitch didn't know how good the snort was.

441
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:41,352
That it was her own fault.
That's how they do.

442
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:45,773
They use people, and when they throw them
away, they find a way to say it ain't on them.

443
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:49,819
Lying motherfucker.
He said they took her to a hospital.

444
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:09,255
- Now get back on D.
- Check out Avon. He's freaking.

445
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:13,801
Shit, man, we got to win this one.

446
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,095
Yo, I think Avon's here.

447
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,056
- Where?
- Like I know what he looks like.

448
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:21,475
He's a black guy
rooting for Westside.

449
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:34,363
We might have a visual on Avon.
Street ball game up at Cloverdale.

450
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:38,409
- Where's Greggs and Freamon?
- Pressing the stripper they picked up.

451
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,997
You and Carver stay on the radio.

452
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,793
- We should follow him.
- Why?

453
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,882
He ain't gonna touch drugs or money
anywhere you can see him, Lieutenant.

454
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:57,928
In Narcotics we follow guys.
We do it well, we make cases on it.

455
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,061
Mount up.

456
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:14,153
We been on this guy three months.
Don't you even wanna get a look at him?

457
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,698
I wouldn't know Avon Barksdale
if I fell over him in the street.

458
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:21,702
I don't need to. We get him by voice
alone or we don't get him.

459
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,875
Yeah, baby!

460
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,838
Half-time.

461
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,216
You got yourself a fine ringer.

462
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,510
Yeah, baby, it's not your year.

463
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:41,263
- It look that way, but you never know.
- I know, man, we up 12.

464
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:45,601
You is,
but I got a proposition for you.

465
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:49,146
- Okay.
- Double down?

466
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:51,816
Let's give this wager a clean
six figures.

467
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:57,947
You serious? I don't give a fuck.
It's your money. You can waste it if you want.

468
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:07,873
- Anyone got him?
- 64-Charlie to central K.

469
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,166
12-10.

470
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:10,668
12-10.

471
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,379
12-10.

472
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,381
You have him?

473
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,509
Lieutenant, I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

474
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,305
Yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

475
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:14,315
Got him marked. On the sideline, red shirt,
white visor. I think he's coaching.

476
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:17,443
Yo, who this fucking midget, yo?

477
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:32,333
Get that midget out of here, B.

478
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,511
Hey.

479
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:50,643
- Why you holler at me?
- We getting down to it.

480
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:54,647
- I get to you when I get to you.
- That's it, we're on the stash.

481
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:58,000
We are?

482
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,495
How can you put that down
when Sydnor wasn't on the roof?

483
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,372
Yes, he was.

484
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:13,916
No, he's not, he's with Daniels.

485
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,502
No, he isn't.

486
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:36,689
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Ref, what the fuck?

487
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,996
What the fuck?

488
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,626
Ref! Ref, what the fuck?

489
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:00,838
The boy was fouled.
Clear, straight up!

490
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,923
How you gonna not call that?

491
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,595
I can put time back on the clock
and replay it.

492
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,932
You talking about a do-over?
A fucking do-over?

493
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:15,436
That's not how the game is played!
You can't do that!

494
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,271
Nigger talking about
doing it again.

495
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:21,275
- I don't want any trouble.
- Ain't gonna be no trouble over no ball.

496
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:24,153
Man, you supposed to be the ref.

497
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:27,865
Why don't you stand up
for your fucking self? You pussy.

498
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:32,244
You can't let any old motherfucking nigger
get in your face, understand?

499
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:37,166
Walk away. Walk away!

500
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,543
Turn around and walk the fuck away.

501
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:42,212
Ignorant motherfucker.

502
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,383
- We cool?
- We cool, baby.

503
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:49,470
Tell your people to come to the park
Saturday at noon.

504
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:54,475
You come on the Westside again,
without a ball, I'm gonna light your ass up.

505
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,900
- D'Angelo, huh?
- You know him?

506
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:05,486
At this point, it feels like I do.

507
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,576
We sort of moved in together.

508
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,830
He seemed like he was different.

509
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:22,920
- I have to quit the club.
- Yes, you do. But not just yet.

510
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:26,340
We need your help.
Which is why we came to you.

511
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,009
- I don't know what else...
- Keisha was not the first.

512
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:33,347
Unless somebody steps up a little bit,
she's not gonna be the last neither.

513
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,687
You like that one?

514
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:44,483
Why don't you keep it?

515
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,198
Thank you.

516
00:40:57,205 --> 00:41:00,207
- He's getting into a black Ford Excursion.
- Copy that.

517
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,460
He's pulling out,
north on Collington.

518
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,558
11-71.

519
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:20,144
You got the parallel on the north,
I got him on the south.

520
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:24,565
11-71, I got him.
Looks like he's going east on Oliver.

521
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,736
<i>Some make a livin'
doin' killin'...</i>

522
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,451
<i>Pass the information
or pass the wine</i>

523
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:38,036
<i>Pass the buck
or pass the baton</i>

524
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,831
<i>But you can't pass the police
or the Pentagon...</i>

525
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:44,251
He just parked. East of Oliver.

526
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:47,421
12-10, you keep the eyeball.

527
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:51,508
11-71, take up a position on Federal,
west of Montford.

528
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:53,594
I'm coming up from the south.

529
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,600
11-71, I copy that.

530
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,060
He's just sitting there.

531
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,623
<i>Television and radio stations...</i>

532
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:26,960
- He's doubling back.
- Copy.

533
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,262
He's south on Montford.

534
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:55,113
He jumped the light at Preston and Milton
and is south on Milton.

535
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:08,835
Be advised that
he didn't make it to Chase.

536
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:11,505
11-71, what's your status?

537
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:13,840
He couldn't have gone past us.

538
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,594
11-71, nothing on this side.

539
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:23,684
Must have went to ground.

540
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,817
Hold your positions.
I'll take a look.

541
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,873
<i>Fuck the constitution</i>

542
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:50,085
<i>Are we part of the solution
or are we part of the pollution?</i>

543
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,795
<i>Sittin' by and wonderin' why</i>

544
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,798
<i>Things ain't the way
we like to find them to be</i>

545
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:59,094
<i>To be, for you and for me, the people
over there and the ones in between...</i>

546
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:06,393
- He called again, same payphone.
- Same voice?

547
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,354
Main stash house, it's got to be.
The pattern fits.

548
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:12,149
- Who took the call at the projects?
- Who knows?

549
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:17,237
There was no one on the roof. Sydnor was
off with Daniels, chasing Avon in the street.

550
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:21,867
We had a good day too. Kima turned
one of the dancers over at Avon's club.

551
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:25,037
The one who's fucking D'Angelo.

552
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:59,571
This guy's good.
We threw everything we had at him.

553
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,449
You know what they say,
stupid criminals make stupid cops.

554
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:06,370
I'm proud to be chasing this guy.

555
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:10,457
We got four front companies so far,
buying up all kinds of shit.

556
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,502
A club, an apartment building,
a funeral home

557
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:17,381
and real estate on the west side
of downtown by the Howard Street corridor.

558
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,633
Shop fronts and warehouses.

559
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:23,845
- Barksdale's name on it?
- Fronts, mostly. Relatives, some.

560
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,723
Mind if I have a seat?

561
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:31,937
He's had the projects for more than a year
and it's a money factory.

562
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:35,482
We popped Wee-Bey coming out
the other day with 22,000.

563
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:38,652
The boys on the wire were saying
it wasn't much of a loss.

564
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,112
22?

565
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,906
One morning from the towers
and the Pit.

566
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,575
Add the avenue corners,
you're up near 30.

567
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:49,329
Another take for the evening,
60,000.

568
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:53,875
- A day?
- That's 25 million a year, conservatively.

569
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:57,212
Take out 20%
for running expenses and spillage

570
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:00,549
and you are still clearing
a million dollars a month.

571
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:04,177
- So, where does it all go?
- He shows no flash.

572
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:08,432
He's got no house,
no car in his name,

573
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,517
no jewelry, no clothes.

574
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:14,062
Just front companies
and the property.

575
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,189
And political contributions.

576
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:23,613
75,000 last month alone, all from
his front companies or their listed officers.

577
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:25,949
And that's just at a quick glance.

578
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:28,827
I'm just totaling up
the legal contributions.

579
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:33,123
You've got the likes of Damien Price,
aide to a state senator,

580
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:37,919
driving out 20,000 in cash from the projects
whenever he feels it.

581
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:43,341
I know you don't wanna hear this,
but the money is real and it's everywhere.

582
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:47,554
And more than the drugs,
it's the money that matters.

583
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:53,518
I ain't fucked nobody else
if that's what you thinking.

584
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:58,773
All right. I mean, fuck it.
If you wanna go, then go!

585
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:01,568
But you could give me
a goddamn reason.

586
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:10,076
- What do I look like to you?
- What you mean?

587
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:14,831
- What do I look like to you?
- You look like a girl, a woman.

588
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:16,958
A beautiful woman.
You fine. What?

589
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:19,419
I don't look like trash to you?

590
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,215
Baby, this ain't about what you do.

591
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:27,969
I don't look like something you could
roll up in a rug and throw in the trash?

592
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:36,978
Shardene.

593
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,606
Shardene.

594
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:41,399
Shardene!

595
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,278
Lieutenant, you paged us?
We were almost home.

596
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,614
Sit.

597
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,752
- Hey, checked my count again.
- How bad?

598
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,338
Not too bad, man.

599
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:07,968
- We got hit about 22.
- 22? That's all?

600
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,470
All right.

601
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:25,652
I got towers two, three, five and six
and another one labelled P for the Pit.

602
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:29,656
Where's one and four? It's on the wire
that we took them for 22.

603
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,951
You shitheads turned in 15.
Where's the rest?

604
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:34,411
Lieutenant, we ain't got...

605
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:39,457
You have till roll call tomorrow to crawl back
to whatever rock you hid it under.

606
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:43,503
It comes back and it goes to ECU.

607
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:45,922
This doesn't happen.

608
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:49,843
Not with me. Not with my unit.

609
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,857
I wouldn't steal and
not tell you about it.

610
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,672
This some of Avon's shit.

611
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:31,968
You got Avon Barksdale chasing
your ass all around town

612
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:34,429
and you still find time
to take his shit.

613
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:37,015
- It's your shit now.
- What I want with that?

614
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,225
What anybody want with that, man?

615
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:42,562
- How much you asking?
- We free.

616
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:44,481
Free?

617
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:49,736
I'm saying, I got a little
proposition for you.

618
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:53,531
Proposition is,
you get four G-packs for free,

619
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:56,326
you give me some better idea
on how I can reach Avon.

620
00:49:57,495 --> 00:50:00,705
- How to contact him?
- You all just had a game, right?

621
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:02,916
How you get a hold of him
to parley?

622
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,959
We talk now and then.

623
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:07,087
I page his ass.

624
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,007
Okay. Okay.

625
00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:14,678
- That all you need? A number?
- I could make do with it.

626
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:16,721
And a code for one of his peoples.

627
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,351
What Wee-Bey use, 07?

628
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,813
07.

629
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:32,779
What makes you think I ain't gonna take this
and throw your ass up outta here?

630
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:36,866
Avon goes down, the projects
be open market again, right?

631
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:40,620
Let me understand.

632
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:44,582
Avon loses 100 large to me
on a bet,

633
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:50,630
then you bring me some of his shit so that
I can put your predatory self on his ass.

634
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,134
Not his day, is it?

635
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,977
Fuck it.

636
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:14,738
Fuck. Fuck.

637
00:51:31,464 --> 00:51:33,089
Fuck it.

638
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:39,137
- Where was it?
- The wheel well.

639
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:42,390
You remember when the bag broke?

640
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,061
Think Daniels will believe it?

641
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,606
Would you?

642
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,153
You didn't believe me.

643
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:58,156
I'm sorry.

644
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:02,535
Savino late. I'm ready to make
this money-run, get the fuck out here.

645
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,371
- You tired?
- I'm tired, man, I'm hungry.

646
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:07,707
Me too. Want something to eat
from the diner?

647
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:10,335
You going over there?
Get me a cheese steak.

648
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:12,921
- You hungry too?
- I could do a burger.

649
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:16,341
Let me get onions on that, man.

650
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:24,098
You organizing it right? My 50s with my 50s,
and my 100s with my 100s?

651
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,811
All right, ladies, good night.

652
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:30,688
I see you all tomorrow,
on time, you hear?

653
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,134
Count this money, baby.

654
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,807
- What the fuck?
- Who's that?

655
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,602
Wee-Bey swinging me
an emergency call.

656
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,709
Fuck.

657
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:35,044
Bey?

658
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:36,963
Yeah.

659
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:39,883
911 call.

660
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:42,552
