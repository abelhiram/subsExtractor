1
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:25,066
Hey, now.

2
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:34,200
We called earlier.
They said you were up

3
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:37,245
but by the time we get here,
you back asleep.

4
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:43,376
- Been there long?
- Nah.

5
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:47,255
20 minutes.

6
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:51,050
You know, we didn't want to
exactly disturb you.

7
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,220
I'm bored, is all.

8
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,639
Yeah, but still.

9
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,308
So what you got for me?

10
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,103
Spreads?

11
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,563
Yeah.

12
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,447
Little Man. For sure.

13
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,991
That's good.
Are you able to write?

14
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,879
OK. Number two.

15
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,223
I can make Little Man.

16
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:45,062
Cos he's in the front trying
to snatch the cash off the dashboard.

17
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:52,153
But the other one,
he's outside in the dark.

18
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:58,618
- So...
- So, you know, it's OK. It's OK.

19
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:04,123
Is there anyone here
that you do recognize?

20
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,084
Sure. Wee-Bey.

21
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,884
All right.

22
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:19,347
Let me tell you where
we're coming from with the shooters.

23
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:24,227
We tracked their escape route.
Landsman came up with their hoodies.

24
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:28,439
Now, DNA matched human hair
from one of the hoodies to Wee-Bey.

25
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:34,737
Freamon tracked a call from the pay phone
near the scene to Stringer Bell's pager.

26
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,241
The caller was using Bey's
beeper code.

27
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,787
Crime lab, they lift
a print off a soda can

28
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,581
near that phone and that
matches Little Man.

29
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:50,586
You know, so, I'm saying...

30
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:00,137
OK, hear me out.

31
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,723
There's a downside here.

32
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:09,605
We don't have the guns,
no prints from the scene, no witnesses.

33
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:14,026
Worse, we're going to be dealing
with a Baltimore jury.

34
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,612
A good man is hard to find
in this town.

35
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,658
12 of them together,
especially.

36
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,293
An ID of both your shooters

37
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,130
will play a whole lot
easier come trial.

38
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,387
You know...

39
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,516
sometimes niggers
just gotta play hard.

40
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,828
<i>If you walk through the garden</i>

41
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,915
<i>You'd better watch your back</i>

42
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,169
<i>Well, I beg your pardon</i>

43
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,505
<i>Walk the straight
and narrow track</i>

44
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,509
<i>If you walk with Jesus</i>

45
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:24,138
<i>He'll save your soul</i>

46
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:28,643
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

47
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,520
<i>Down in the hole</i>

48
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,441
<i>All the angels sing</i>

49
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,528
<i>About Jesus' mighty sword</i>

50
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,366
<i>And they shield you
with their wings</i>

51
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,578
<i>Keep you close to the Lord</i>

52
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,082
<i>Don't pay heed to temptation</i>

53
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,794
<i>For his hands are so cold</i>

54
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,923
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

55
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,843
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

56
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,312
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

57
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,191
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

58
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,946
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

59
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,074
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

60
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,712
We got everyone on our list
except CCO.

61
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:42,800
We hit his mama's house and she says that
he went up to Wabash for some court date.

62
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:47,596
Get on the computer and see if the Sheriff's
deputies can snatch him up in a courtroom.

63
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,100
Yeah.

64
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:56,105
No, we got Ronnie Mo. I'm looking at him
go in the jail van right now.

65
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,108
All right.

66
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,487
- Fished our limit. Let's go home.
- Sir.

67
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:07,700
Let's go home, sir.

68
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,619
You're looking at a
soon-to-be-made sergeant.

69
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:15,249
What I'm saying is, when we're around troops,
get used to showing respect.

70
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:19,045
So, let's go home, sir.
All right?

71
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,062
What's the count?

72
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:41,067
So far we've picked up 12.
That leaves seven on the wing.

73
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,278
Anything worthwhile?

74
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,990
Some phone numbers that match,
scraps of nicknames.

75
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:53,287
We need something. They'll shut us down
unless we come up with something fresh.

76
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,248
The wires are dead.
The bug in the club is useless.

77
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,375
They're moving out.

78
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,669
- To where?
- No clue.

79
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,380
But they're going to have
to set up again.

80
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,967
Either Barksdale moves to reset
his distribution or he gives up.

81
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,845
- If not Avon, then Stringer.
- Why not Avon?

82
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,848
With no priors, he's out
two hours after the bail review.

83
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,352
What we put on Barksdale
barely makes him break stride.

84
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,562
So we get a hint of where
they're setting up.

85
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,689
We ask for a new bug,

86
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,858
maybe even a wire
if we get onto a phone.

87
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,610
Not while the deputy breathes air.

88
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,279
We'll be reassigned
before you finish your affidavit.

89
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,573
How about the feds?

90
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:32,118
You think the deputy will
let you take this federal?

91
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,370
Why does the deputy need to know?

92
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,834
McNulty,
you are a piece of work.

93
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,210
Yep.

94
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,129
McNulty.

95
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,384
Yeah?

96
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,512
No shit.

97
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,723
No fucking shit.

98
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,144
It's Rhonda Pearlman.

99
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,313
She just got a call from a public
defender in North Jersey

100
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,108
who claims to represent
D'Angelo Barksdale.

101
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,236
Meet me in Homicide.
Bring a tape recorder.

102
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,738
No drug lawyers? No Levy?

103
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,119
- Case got some legs on her, don't she?
- Don't she?

104
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,956
Quarter of a million dollars bail.
You believe that shit?

105
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,750
It hurts to show that kind of money.

106
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,586
Where Levy at?
He ain't at the club, is he?

107
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,005
Club's out.
We can't talk there no more.

108
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,968
- Come on, man, let's get out of here.
- What's up, baby?

109
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,849
So, this is it?

110
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:41,937
Before you go anyplace, before you talk
anyplace, we got to think this through.

111
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,858
We're up to almost 20 arrests
at last count.

112
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,069
And if you look at the probable cause,
they read like yours...

113
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,322
information from
a confidential source.

114
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,908
This seems too much
for one snitch.

115
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:57,620
I agree.
My gut tells me a wire.

116
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:02,166
Either a phone or two, or maybe
something in a room somewhere.

117
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,793
You talk to your nephew
on the phone?

118
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:10,507
Of course not. No phones. When we talk,
it's face-to-face, in the back of the club.

119
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,803
- Fuck.
- It's good you moved out.

120
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:19,391
I don't know. I mean, if they got a mic in there,
they got you and me saying all kinds of shit.

121
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,480
That reminds me.
He said he'd be in tonight.

122
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:29,568
- Thing is, they take you and leave me?
- That's what's fucking me up too, man.

123
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:32,488
We'll know as soon as
I start pressing for discovery.

124
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,824
What about the people
they locked up?

125
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,036
- We got to pull them.
- That's showing a lot of money.

126
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,914
If we don't,
we run the risk of making them enemies.

127
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,667
Speaking of which,
where are you with your nephew?

128
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,377
Is he going to see the light?

129
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:50,673
Let me tell you something, man.
He's family, all right? He not going to buck.

130
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:55,803
A day or two in the bullpen, he's gonna be
crying, waiting for bail like the rest of them.

131
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,513
All right.

132
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,183
Let's run the money through the families,
that'll hide it some.

133
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,311
- And don't use the same bondsman.
- All right.

134
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:08,524
Look, gentlemen. I want you to start
thinking about who was charged

135
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,359
and what kind of time
they can do.

136
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,154
One way to limit your exposure
is what's called a structured plea.

137
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:19,994
That means you have to deliver your people,
all of them, down to a man.

138
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,746
I saw your girl today,
for the idents.

139
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,542
How's she doing?

140
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,879
OK, I guess.
She's out of the ICU.

141
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,798
Moving slow, but moving, you know?

142
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,594
Jimmy, you ain't been to see her?

143
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,596
No. I couldn't go in.

144
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,890
This ain't about you, right?

145
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,477
When I get back from Jersey,
I will.

146
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,816
I will.

147
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:55,571
You know, Cole and me,
we showed her the spreads.

148
00:10:55,655 --> 00:11:00,117
Picked out Little Man, no problem. Wouldn't
go for Wee-Bey. So I tried the fat finger.

149
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,705
Damn near begging her to make this play
easier in court. You know what she said?

150
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,709
Sometimes niggers
gotta play hard.

151
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,589
- Real police.
- Oh, yeah.

152
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,101
- What the fuck did you do to her?
- I don't know.

153
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:31,106
You two in the same car gonna make
for a long-ass drive to Jersey.

154
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,317
Shit.

155
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,505
- Is this mahogany?
- This isn't mahogany, for Christ's sake.

156
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,507
Is this mahogany?

157
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:14,149
Damn, man, it's just...
it's too still in here.

158
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,035
Slow down!

159
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,126
You know what? We can...

160
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,006
This place will be fine.

161
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,135
All we really got to do is
put a little safe in here someplace

162
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:45,180
and let them know the count
comes here from now on. Period.

163
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,476
Damn, boy.
When y'all change up, y'all...

164
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,481
Y'all that paranoid?
You ain't even been up in there before.

165
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,942
I'm telling you,
this shit is different.

166
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,695
We are not going to talk about
nothing indoors. It's a new day.

167
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,199
We got to get back on our feet.

168
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,411
The longer we hold off, the harder
it's going to be to maintain them towers.

169
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,747
You want to get it back up,
lean to me and String.

170
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,000
- I ain't down yet.
- You need to step back.

171
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,254
You can't take a second chance here.
You know what I'm saying?

172
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:21,508
Until you fixed, sis going to handle that
money, I'm going to handle the products.

173
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,219
- We here for you.
- All right.

174
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,140
But you tell Roberto,
he got to make it a serious smoker.

175
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:32,561
I want them motherfucking fiends in
the projects dropping like flies. You feel me?

176
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,230
You send out the word,
let them know we ain't dead yet.

177
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,736
- What about my nephew?
- Don't fret.

178
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,656
Give me a chance to get with Roberto,
and I'll get up to D.

179
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,742
Do what needs doing.

180
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,412
Tell him I'm sorry
for putting him out there like that

181
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,207
and that I'm going to make
it up to him.

182
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,417
You going to make it up.

183
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,419
Most def.

184
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:08,972
I want to make it clear that the
cooperation is contingent on a commitment

185
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,225
that my client finds acceptable.

186
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,811
Failing that, everything said
in here stays in here.

187
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:15,854
Damn straight.

188
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:19,358
A proffer in Maryland
plays much the same in Jersey.

189
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:24,738
I agree that with regard to matters involving
drug trafficking, your client has been helpful.

190
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:28,909
He's indicated a willingness to testify
that he was a lieutenant

191
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,745
in Avon Barksdale's
drug organization,

192
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,957
sold large quantities of drugs
for his uncle.

193
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,501
Delivered money,
attended meetings,

194
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:41,171
and, on one occasion, made a trip
to New York on the behest of his uncle.

195
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,466
All of which corroborates
much of what we already know.

196
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,386
What else is there?

197
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,638
The murders.

198
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,182
Man, why do you keep on that?

199
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,937
I already told you, I don't know nothing
about that witness being killed.

200
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,146
Which witness?

201
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,692
Remember her?

202
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,486
Jesus.

203
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:08,699
- They did her?
- About the same time they did the boy.

204
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,960
All them bodies.

205
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:27,009
- They covering up, man.
- That's what we think.

206
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:30,053
- No loose ends.
- I can understand the guard.

207
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,180
She got paid, so she had to go.

208
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:36,602
Orlando, he knew too much,
got to snitching, so he had to go.

209
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,272
But then there's the kid...

210
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,482
Wallace.

211
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:47,613
I need to go past Argyle Street
tonight. Check in with Wallace.

212
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,992
He off the hook since we helped
the tower crew, get that stick-up boy.

213
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,994
Wallace is bugging.

214
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,496
Don't hardly even come out
of that room no more.

215
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,499
- Why he be like that?
- He might be getting high.

216
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,127
The boy's scaring me
with his shit.

217
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,921
- All right, holler at me later.
- That'll work.

218
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,508
You got that shit on tape?

219
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,225
- God!
- His name is Brandon Wright.

220
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,188
Burned him, broke fingers,
gouged an eye out, all kinds of fun.

221
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,649
Wallace was the one who saw.

222
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,403
He saw the boy.

223
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,573
But he didn't think about
what they'd do.

224
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,327
You must have known.
You were by that pay phone.

225
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,205
- You knew.
- What was I going to do, huh?

226
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,917
I don't call String, word get back uptown,
what's going to happen then?

227
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:48,423
So you told Wallace to wait, then you called
Stringer and he gathered the troops.

228
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,592
Yeah.

229
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,679
And down at the Greek's,
they got Wallace to point the finger.

230
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,973
Then they went in like cops with handcuffs,
so they could take their time on Brandon.

231
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,227
They dropped the body
where we'd see it.

232
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,772
Send a message to the 'jects,
they said.

233
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,610
Wallace, he couldn't handle that.

234
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:14,491
After seeing that, he wanted to get out,
go back to school.

235
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:19,705
We even joked about it,
him being 16 and all,

236
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,958
needing to go start back over again
as a freshman.

237
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,421
About a week ago, my uncle and String
called me down to the club.

238
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,966
Stringer, he's all worried about Wallace,
and I told him.

239
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,552
I said,
Wallace ain't no snitch.

240
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,346
Plus, he's out the fucking game.

241
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,433
I told him that.

242
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,185
But I needed to do more.

243
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,230
I should've done more.

244
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,485
But I didn't, and, fuck,
that's on me.

245
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,322
Any idea who they sent
at Wallace?

246
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,162
Come on, D. Wild guess.

247
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:04,541
Man, I don't know, could've been anybody.
You know, shooters come cheap.

248
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,294
I don't think so.
Not in the Pit.

249
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:11,006
Not in his crib. I counted seven
beds when I was up there.

250
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:15,969
- Where were the young 'uns?
- Look, if I knew, I would tell you.

251
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,306
All right?
I swear to God, I would tell you.

252
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:24,436
They're charged with Orlando
and the undercover cop

253
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,855
but we're still hunting.

254
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,278
Him, he in Philly.

255
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,657
- How you know?
- Cos I dropped him there.

256
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,870
- Where?
- A corner, North end, I don't know.

257
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:44,498
Did Wee-Bey say anything to you
about the shootings?

258
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,376
We don't talk shop in a car.
It's a rule we got.

259
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,964
So, is that it?

260
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:59,805
Your client must realize that any agreement
is dependent on his full cooperation.

261
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,389
There ain't nothing else.

262
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,234
Diedre.

263
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,740
Tap, tap, tap.

264
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,540
She was one of my uncle's girls.

265
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,959
We got people who put you with her
the night she's killed.

266
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:34,256
I didn't know that he was gonna do her.
I swear. They played me.

267
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,216
How so?

268
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:45,308
My uncle gave me an eight-ball of coke.
Told me to take it over there to her.

269
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,020
I was surprised,
cos I thought he dumped her.

270
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,939
But he said it wasn't
like that no more.

271
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,859
So, he had Wee-Bey take me
over there.

272
00:19:54,735 --> 00:20:00,198
I walked up, knocked on the door, she came
to the door naked, with this little robe on.

273
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:03,451
She's your uncle's girl
but she comes to the door naked?

274
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,996
She used to do that shit
with me all the time, man.

275
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,875
Teasing. You know how girls do.
Maybe you don't.

276
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,336
I don't know.

277
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,465
Anyway, I'm like,
ain't you going to let me come in?

278
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,969
She's like, no. She gotta get ready
for my uncle to come by later.

279
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,889
So, I give her the coke.

280
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,976
She laughs about how she's going to put
that shit on ice, for later on.

281
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,104
Refrigerate it.

282
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,358
I don't know shit about no refrigerator.
Like I said, I didn't go in.

283
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,487
I turned around, started walking back
to the truck and I heard this shot.

284
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:43,909
Wee-Bey came running back
with this big-ass .45 he liked so much.

285
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,244
Tells me how he was tapping
on the window, real soft.

286
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:51,458
She had to walk all the way up cos
she couldn't see what was on the outside.

287
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,295
And when she gets up
to the window and looks out...

288
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,432
- You did good, D'Angelo.
- Yeah, you did.

289
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:25,241
Y'all don't understand, man.

290
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,869
Y'all don't get it.

291
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,289
I grew up in this shit.

292
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,752
My grandfather was Butch Stamford.

293
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,713
You know who Butch Stamford
was in this town?

294
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:46,137
All my people, man,
my father, my uncles, my cousins...

295
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,349
It's just what we do.

296
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:58,108
You just live with this shit
until you can't breathe no more.

297
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:05,031
I swear to God,
I was courtside for eight months

298
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:09,828
and I was freer in jail
than I was at home.

299
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,373
What are you looking for?

300
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,210
I want it to go away.

301
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:21,423
- I can't.
- I want what Wallace wanted.

302
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,717
I want to start over.

303
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:29,222
That's what I want. I don't care where.
Anywhere. I don't give a fuck.

304
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:33,518
I just want to go somewhere
where I can breathe like regular folk.

305
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,522
You give me that...

306
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,192
and I'll give you them.

307
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,284
No, that's great. Really great.

308
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,995
Yeah.

309
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,957
That's our move.

310
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:02,797
OK.

311
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:16,936
We broke it open tonight. Wide open.
I'm bringing this case in big.

312
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,027
So, this squares things
with Burrell, right?

313
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,283
To hell with the man.

314
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:34,496
But we might have enough to reach out to
the feds. Try to run this thing through them.

315
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:37,665
- Cedric.
- He knows about the money, Marla.

316
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,251
He's known for a long while.

317
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:44,047
Fact is, I wouldn't be surprised
if it's why he picked me for this case.

318
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,177
What does he...?
What are you going to...?

319
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:53,515
He's got me if he wants me.
Thing is, I don't think he wants me.

320
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:55,183
Too much stink.

321
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,852
Too much mess.

322
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,068
Kind of like this case.

323
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:11,699
I have to admit it, Jimmy.
This is a great case.

324
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:15,829
Not just because of Greggs,
it goes to that and answers that.

325
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,039
Because of how deep it goes.

326
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,875
I mean, the murders, the money...

327
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:25,088
I feel like I've been drunk
since that kid started talking to us.

328
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,967
You OK to drive? I can drop you home.
You can pick up your car tomorrow.

329
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,969
No, I'm good, I'm good.

330
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:34,514
I'm great, I'm great.
This was fucking great!

331
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,977
You want to try to go federal with this?
I am up for it.

332
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:43,731
I get cross-designated as an AUSA,
and we can really run with it, you know?

333
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,486
Career fucking case.

334
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,619
Anyway...

335
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:08,965
Ronnie, the thing at
Levy's the other day, I was...

336
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,758
I was...

337
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:22,854
Jesus, Ronnie, not here.
What are you doing?

338
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,815
Like you never did it
in the headquarters garage before?

339
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,669
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

340
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:49,297
Look what just walked in
without a fucking escort.

341
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:54,761
Downtown Roy Brown,
the living legend in his own mind.

342
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,264
Uptown Lester Freamon.

343
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,975
Fuck me, how long's it been?

344
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,646
Your retirement party, wasn't it?
And this is retirement?

345
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:06,898
Yeah. Nice fucking digs, huh?

346
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:10,318
I asked my supervisor
when I'll see a little sunlight.

347
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,988
Runt cocksucker says,
when your unit turns a profit.

348
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,658
But enough of my joy.

349
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:18,993
What do you guys need?

350
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,872
We need a trap and trace
but not in Maryland.

351
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,960
- Pennsylvania, Philly.
- You got to go through them.

352
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:31,881
They'll tell us it can't be done.
Then another week to OK our subpoena.

353
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,509
It's more complicated
than a straight-up trace.

354
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,680
We need a list of phones in Philly
that called this number in the past week.

355
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:43,559
- What's the number?
- Drug lawyer, downtown office.

356
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,104
Thought Billing would be
the place to look.

357
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:50,525
Well, if we can do it,
and I'm not saying we can,

358
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,820
it's going to be a fucking week,
maybe two.

359
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,198
Thanks, Roy.

360
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,033
Hey, Lester.

361
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:02,912
Isn't this supposed to be the time
you tell me how fucking important this is?

362
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,715
The Philly number gives us the mope
who shot that female undercover.

363
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:22,557
I'm telling you,
it's the perfect case.

364
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:24,809
- You'll love it.
- It sounds great.

365
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:28,229
But like I said,
we're not fishing for drug cases anymore.

366
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,648
Try DEA.

367
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:35,361
It's too close to our CID. Our bosses would
know we've gone there before a meeting.

368
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,904
Your bosses don't know
you're doing this?

369
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,201
Who'll be coming?

370
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,579
Me, a detective name of Freamon,
and Daniels.

371
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,959
I can speak for Daniels, brother.
He's played this thing out with real heart.

372
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,629
Come on, set something up.

373
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:57,800
All right.

374
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:09,854
Could I get ten copies?

375
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:13,107
- Ten copies?
- Ten, right.

376
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,702
No problems?

377
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:26,621
No.

378
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:28,915
No?

379
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,548
All right, man, I'll get at you.

380
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,975
Yo, you locked that door, right?
Yeah?

381
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,187
All right, so listen.
It's not street-ready, all right?

382
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,107
Everybody's gonna work
on their own cut.

383
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:57,485
Now, listen to me,
tell them to get this straight.

384
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:03,491
Three parts of this, all right?
To one of raw, all right?

385
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:06,244
That's how we gonna do
until we get the new stash.

386
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:09,080
I want you to put the word out there
that we back up.

387
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,500
Understand me? We back up.

388
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:17,547
It's a good target.
You guys have a pretty good case here.

389
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:22,427
Look at the violence alone. There's a dozen
murders, including state's witnesses.

390
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:26,097
If you help us squeeze the Barksdale kid
into a witness protection program,

391
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,723
we can run wild.

392
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:31,310
- No suppliers though.
- We're still looking for a way into that.

393
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,522
There was nothing on the wire
that took us toward New York.

394
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:39,360
The trouble is,
we have these post-9/11 protocols.

395
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:44,657
We can't pick up any new narcotics work
unless it goes to priority crime targets.

396
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:48,578
Meaning Cosa Nostra or Colombians.
Or Russians maybe.

397
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:52,290
- We don't have Colombians in Baltimore.
- We don't have any wise guys.

398
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:55,668
All we got is locals
busy tearing the Westside apart.

399
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:58,880
I hear you
but the Bureau-wide protocol applies.

400
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,258
To run with you on this,
we need a recognized OC target

401
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:05,595
or a connect to counterterrorism
or corruption.

402
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:09,056
You go near stuff like that, we have
something we can bring to our ASAC.

403
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:14,187
- What kind of corruption?
- Don't know. What kind you got?

404
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:20,735
Yo, Poot, we up yet?

405
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,696
- Where Roc-Roc at with the shit?
- Package in.

406
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,866
- Who is it?
- Onion and them off-brand niggers.

407
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,202
Onion?

408
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:32,246
- What the fuck they got?
- Some shit they call yellow tops.

409
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,586
Got them yellow tops, y'all.
Yellow tops.

410
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,593
Yellow tops, yellow tops.

411
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:49,514
Motherfucker,
what the fuck is up? Huh?

412
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:54,602
What the fuck is y'all doing? Do what you feel.
But be ready to finish what you start.

413
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,605
What you doing?
This ain't no open market.

414
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:01,776
Ain't no market at all. You ain't got shit
to sell. Back your ass up for those that do.

415
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:04,111
- You know what?
- What?

416
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,948
Get the fuck out of here, bitch!
Get your ass outta here!

417
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:14,580
- See, that's why we can't win.
- Why not?

418
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,794
They fuck up, they get beat.
We fuck up, they give us pensions.

419
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,714
Close it!
Get the fuck out of here!

420
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,653
Heard you ain't much
as an eyeball witness.

421
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,532
Bad as any civilian.

422
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,702
Guess so.

423
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,498
Where we at?

424
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:02,169
- With what?
- With the case, fool.

425
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,338
Jesus, give it a rest.

426
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,049
What's on the wire?

427
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,681
- Come on, man.
- Wire's dead.

428
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:16,851
They changed up after
we hit them with raids.

429
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,270
Daniels didn't tell you?

430
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,356
Hell, no.

431
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,609
He only talks to me
about the good shit.

432
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,945
About how y'all were
onto my shooters and stuff.

433
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:33,159
Yeah, well, we lost the wire,
but the good news is D'Angelo's flipped.

434
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,411
We're talking to
the feds about...

435
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,538
Fuck both y'all.

436
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:44,503
She wants me to quit.

437
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,883
Says there ain't nothing
worth this.

438
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,470
So, I promised her
I'd think about it.

439
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,599
What do you say?

440
00:32:58,769 --> 00:32:59,935
I don't know. I...

441
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:05,566
I guess you should do
what you need to.

442
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,361
But she's right.

443
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:11,530
It isn't worth it.

444
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:15,868
No?

445
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:18,412
Yeah.

446
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,498
Probably not.

447
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:31,175
Anyway, what took you so long
getting up in here?

448
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:35,763
Shit. No cards, no flowers.

449
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,723
I mean, what the fuck, Jimmy?

450
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,767
I couldn't, I...

451
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,270
I felt...

452
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,483
A case like this,
it's always you or Sydnor

453
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,736
or some other black cop
who ends up going undercover.

454
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,619
I swear, if I could do it over...

455
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,417
If I...

456
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,877
If I could do it over...

457
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,464
you know what I'd do?

458
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,803
Put more tape
on that fucking gun.

459
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,475
I'm sorry, Kima.

460
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,146
I'm sorry.

461
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:33,154
Anyway, since I got you up in here
acting like my bitch and shit...

462
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:37,324
with all your
guilty-ass crying and whatnot...

463
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:42,371
maybe you can do something for me.

464
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:47,334
She said you were doing good.
Said she was proud of you.

465
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,338
How's she doing?

466
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,258
Still shook.

467
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:59,764
But she wanted you to have that and told me
to tell you she's sorry to be late with it.

468
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,350
Girl got such heart, you know?

469
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:05,811
Yeah.

470
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:11,609
This is enough for what I got
going on now, man.

471
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:14,487
You give the rest back to her.

472
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:17,907
Are you sure?

473
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:29,043
Give her my love.

474
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,545
Right.

475
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:36,175
Hey, McNulty.

476
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,430
Don't tell her.

477
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,899
- What you got, man?
- Over there, man.

478
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:56,821
Un-fucking-believable.
Five guys got jumped. Not just you.

479
00:35:56,905 --> 00:36:00,199
- Four other guys jumped me.
- I'm sorry, man.

480
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:06,914
It's got to be all the brutality complaints.
It'll never matter how well I do on no test.

481
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,835
You don't know that.
You might make the next list, you know?

482
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,420
- You don't know.
- Yeah.

483
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,549
Guess I ain't leadership material.
Congratulations, Carv.

484
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:19,260
Thanks.

485
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,221
Yeah.

486
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:40,990
The world is on its ass.

487
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,954
Guy called for you
from the phone company.

488
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:49,832
He's got the number
for a house in Philadelphia.

489
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,375
Beautiful, thank you.

490
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:02,011
- Good casework.
- Thank you.

491
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:03,846
I don't think
I'm giving anything away

492
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:07,808
by telling that Arnold has had a file on
Senator Davis for two years.

493
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,560
It took us a while,

494
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:13,480
but the quid pro quo is in that Westside
redevelopment mess.

495
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:17,067
Barksdale or his fronts
grease enough city politicians

496
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:21,238
and word comes back years in advance
where the development zone's gonna be.

497
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:26,452
He buys every piece of garbage real estate
he can, exaggerates the values.

498
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:30,289
The city's gonna pay him millions
to condemn the properties.

499
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,042
It's a lot to work with,
but we're willing.

500
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:38,589
The question is, can your cooperator give us
the senator or any other political figure?

501
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:41,342
- The cooperator?
- D'Angelo Barksdale.

502
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:43,761
What does he have for us
on the money?

503
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,476
Nothing.

504
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,645
He gives you the drugs
and the violence.

505
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:55,356
He gives you Avon Barksdale,
Stringer Bell.

506
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,734
- And they give us the senator.
- Maybe.

507
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:02,196
Whoa, whoa, you're making
Barksdale and Bell cooperators

508
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,156
and the politicians the target?

509
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:05,532
Of course.

510
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,494
Fuck the politicians.
It's Barksdale and Bell.

511
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:11,538
They turned West Baltimore
into a free-fire zone.

512
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,040
No one's saying they walk.

513
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,626
But if we bring you the case,

514
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:20,214
you'll let Barksdale and Bell reduce
any sentence they get through cooperation?

515
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,717
Jesus Christ, are you kidding?
You're seeing all this ass-backwards.

516
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:27,096
We have a mandate
to pursue political corruption.

517
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,807
- Can you believe these guys?
- Jimmy, look.

518
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:34,645
Drugs and murder don't cut it anymore?
How about terrorism?

519
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:39,149
These guys have dropped 14, 15 bodies.
The witnesses, cooperators.

520
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,527
That kind of hyperbole
doesn't serve anyone, Detective.

521
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,415
I think we're going with
a different direction on this.

522
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,500
Thank you for your time.

523
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:01,922
West Baltimore is dying
and you empty suits

524
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,758
are running around trying to pin
some politician's pelt to the wall.

525
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,597
Thought you was real police,
brother.

526
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,542
So, they got you all
the way out here?

527
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,087
I started out
thinking you was in Jersey.

528
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:46,925
You ain't in Jersey, I figured they still
got you down in Central Booking.

529
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:50,804
All the way out here...

530
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:56,310
- Do send a message though.
- A message needs sending.

531
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,480
How y'all even find me?

532
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:03,358
Ain't no one going to keep
a mother from her son, right?

533
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:12,826
You know,
he always talking family.

534
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,538
Family is the heart,
he say.

535
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,793
Well, I'm family, ain't I?

536
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:25,089
Well, what about me for once?

537
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,258
It ain't right.

538
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,427
What's right?

539
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:36,683
You like for him to step up,
take all the weight, and let you walk?

540
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:40,354
Because he will.
You know he will.

541
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:46,026
But if he got to go away that mean
you got to step up and fill his shoes.

542
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,028
You ready for that?

543
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,322
Ma, you know I ain't.

544
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,867
I ain't ready,
and I'm never gonna be ready.

545
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:55,577
- D, come on.
- Look.

546
00:40:56,746 --> 00:41:01,667
They're giving me a chance to walk away
to start again someplace else.

547
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,629
And what you giving them?

548
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,886
Look...

549
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,808
He messed up, D.
He knows it.

550
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:22,563
Now if you want to
get even with him, you can.

551
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:28,068
But you hurt him,
you hurt this whole family. All of us.

552
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,404
Me and Trina and the cousins.

553
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:35,742
And Donette too. And your baby.
Your own baby boy.

554
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,247
This right here is
part of the game, D.

555
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:44,835
And without the game, this whole family
would be down in the fucking Terrace

556
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,253
living off scraps.

557
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,005
We probably wouldn't even
be a family.

558
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,092
Start over, huh?

559
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,179
How the fuck you going to
start over without your peoples?

560
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:57,806
Without your own child, even?

561
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:06,732
You ain't got family in this world,
what the hell you got?

562
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15,908
This motherfucker Wee-Bey twitches,
there won't even be a trial.

563
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,205
Detective Carver, a word.

564
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,172
Shut the door.

565
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,268
What's up, LT?

566
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,147
Anything you want to tell me?

567
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:52,861
Been weeks now.

568
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,573
The deputy ops knows what's going on
in this unit almost before I do.

569
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:03,372
Except last week, we run the bug up
into Barksdale's club office

570
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:07,334
and Burrell, for once,
he's a step behind.

571
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:10,170
You see it?

572
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:15,550
- Maybe he...
- I see it.

573
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,428
I look around the office

574
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:22,099
and I see that one of my people
is at the academy for in-service.

575
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,105
Lieutenant, I swear,
it wasn't my idea.

576
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:32,025
I'm minding my business,
doing my job

577
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,278
when the man calls me for coffee
and a Danish.

578
00:43:34,404 --> 00:43:36,905
I never been on the eighth
floor of that fucking building.

579
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:42,327
And there's the deputy fucking ops telling me
how concerned he is about the case,

580
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,831
how he needs to be informed.

581
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:50,127
I mean,
he's the Deputy fucking Ops, man.

582
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:08,145
Couple weeks from now you're gonna be
in some district somewhere

583
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:11,773
with 11 or 12 uniforms
looking to you for everything.

584
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,902
And some of them
are going to be good police.

585
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,741
Some of them will be stupid,
a few will be pieces of shit.

586
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:24,494
But all of them will take
their cue from you.

587
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,749
You show loyalty,
they learn loyalty.

588
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,585
Show them it's about the work,
it will be.

589
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:35,255
Show them some other kind of game,
then that's the game they'll play.

590
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:47,184
I came on in the Eastern.

591
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,520
A piece-of-shit lieutenant
was hoping to be a captain,

592
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:53,273
piece-of-shit sergeants
hoping to be lieutenants.

593
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:56,777
Pretty soon we had piece-of-shit patrolmen
trying to figure the job for themselves.

594
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:01,990
And some of what happens then
is hard as hell to live down.

595
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,383
Comes a day you're going to have to decide
whether it's about you or about the work.

596
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:35,440
Grand jury came in Tuesday.

597
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,235
But you knew that, right?

598
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,489
We're working a flight
warrant today.

599
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:44,825
There's...

600
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:47,994
There's a lot to do here,
in-office.

601
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,540
I'd be careful with that though.

602
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,667
I understand the trigger pull
used to be light.

603
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,951
Keep him down, keep him down.

604
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:33,874
You got him? Get him up there,
get him up there.

605
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:38,503
Bunch of low-bottom bitches.

606
00:46:38,588 --> 00:46:41,756
- Get his wrists.
- You didn't have to fuck with my ride.

607
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:49,097
You motherfuckers got lucky.

608
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,113
Yeah?

609
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:12,454
Podunk lawyer in Denton's
giving the guards a hard time

610
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,499
about moving D'Angelo
from original jurisdiction.

611
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,459
Put the call through.

612
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:20,253
OK.

613
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:26,092
Officer Mace, ASA Pearlman.
You got a problem with the lawyer?

614
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,306
OK, put the asshole on.

615
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:35,810
This is he.

616
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:49,574
You do not make it easy, Jimmy.
I have to admit, I am deeply ambivalent.

617
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:52,452
- Excuse me?
- Sit.

618
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,621
Sit.

619
00:47:56,624 --> 00:48:00,126
- Here.
- I heard from Bunk.

620
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,879
Philly. Great work.

621
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:08,009
You all did great work. And the number
of clearances I'm looking at here...

622
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:11,471
Christ, for the first time this year,
we got the clearance rate up over 40%.

623
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,015
That's on the one hand.

624
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:18,687
On the other hand, the deputy ops
got a call from the deputy US attorney

625
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:23,024
asking whether an asshole such as
yourself really works for us.

626
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:28,405
This is the first the deputy hears
his troops are creeping behind his back

627
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:31,491
to take a case federal
when they were told it was closed.

628
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:36,162
You're a good detective.

629
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,832
And I've got to admit
you got some stones on you.

630
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,544
Did you actually call
the first deputy an empty suit?

631
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:49,551
I want to see you land OK, Jimmy.

632
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,138
So, tell me,
where don't you want to go?

633
00:48:57,393 --> 00:49:01,521
You all know that Baltimore city jurors
are capable of just about anything.

634
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:07,861
If you want to spend months going through a
bunch of half-heard telephone conversations

635
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:11,031
and see how well you do,
I'll certainly respect the effort.

636
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:15,243
It's not just talk on the wire. We've got
money and lot of dope on the table.

637
00:49:15,328 --> 00:49:16,536
And a lot of violence.

638
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:19,998
All of which stops way short of
Mr. Barksdale. You know this.

639
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:23,418
All of it except for the New Jersey bust.
That one he eats.

640
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,965
Maybe he does. Maybe he pleads to one
count of attempted possession

641
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:31,468
and takes, I don't know,
maybe three, four.

642
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:36,056
Maybe he can arrange for everyone you have
on those tapes to follow suit.

643
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,977
Maybe you get five-year pleas from
those with no prior felony convictions.

644
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:44,648
Ten years for those with one prior,
15 for two or more.

645
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,191
What about the murders?

646
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:50,111
We acknowledge you've got Mr. Brice
cold for the murder of Orlando.

647
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:52,405
- And the wounding of the police officer.
- Who?

648
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:54,616
Wee-Bey.

649
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,828
Representing Mr. Brice, I'm fairly confident
that to avoid the death penalty,

650
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:03,083
he'll proffer to at least a half-dozen
of your open murders.

651
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,959
Naming co-conspirators?

652
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:08,546
For that kind of cooperation,
I'd consider straight life.

653
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:14,260
I believe Mr. Brice is ready to take
sole responsibility for all of his crimes.

654
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,764
Still, you walk away
with at least a half-dozen clearances.

655
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,683
Assets.

656
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:24,312
Take the strip club, whatever trucks
and cars you can link to the drugs,

657
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,189
and whatever cash you've seized.

658
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,402
He's got dozens of other properties.
The funeral parlor, the towing company.

659
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:34,364
You get the cars, because
you can tie them to illegal activity.

660
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,282
There's nothing else of his to take.

661
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,660
So you keep the money,
the real estate,

662
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,454
and Stringer Bell stays on the street
with his hand on the throttle.

663
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,583
If you have a charge against
Mr. Bell, file it.

664
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:50,255
Otherwise, I understand that nothing
in all those hours of tape implicates him.

665
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,595
Three or four years ain't
enough, Maury.

666
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,014
Not for Avon Barksdale.

667
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:01,808
No?

668
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:06,855
Make an offer.

669
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:10,024
Part 14 of the circuit court
of Baltimore City now in session.

670
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:12,277
- Be seated.
- First up.

671
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:14,988
State versus Avon Randolph
Barksdale, Your Honor.

672
00:51:15,865 --> 00:51:19,534
One count of possession with intent
to distribute, to wit, a kilogram of heroin.

673
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:23,788
- You have a statement of facts?
- Mr. Barksdale is offering a plea of guilty

674
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:26,666
in exchange for a maximum
of seven years in DOC

675
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:29,169
in consideration of
the following facts...

676
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:32,589
on or about the date of
September 17, 2002,

677
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:34,924
in the jurisdiction of
Essex County,

678
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:37,510
Trooper Robert Warren
of the New York barracks

679
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:42,348
effected a traffic stop on a Ford Taurus
traveling southbound near Exit 13.

680
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:46,728
It resulted from information gleaned from
surveillance of Mr. Barksdale

681
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,147
and his nephew,
D'Angelo Barksdale,

682
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:53,443
by detectives assigned to a detail
under the command of a narcotics supervisor.

683
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:57,447
A search of the vehicle, rented
from the Avis location at BWI Airport,

684
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:02,160
revealed that a kilogram of pure heroin was
concealed beneath a spare tire in the trunk.

685
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:06,790
Mr. Barksdale acknowledges his role
in procuring those drugs

686
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:10,210
with the intent to dilute, package,
and sell retail amounts of heroin.

687
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:14,172
Diedre Kresson, Roland Leggett,
Toreen Boyd, all tied to the same gun.

688
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:18,468
Plus, we got the stick-up boys,
Brandon Wright, John Bailey.

689
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:22,764
With Orlando, that makes six.
Plus the attempted murder on a police.

690
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,224
That it?

691
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:28,019
- I do better if I give them more?
- Life, no parole, means what it says.

692
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:30,897
This proffer keeps you off death row
but that's all.

693
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:33,775
You were on the wrong side
of a cop getting shot.

694
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:35,860
You want to dream about
straight life,

695
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:39,823
you got to talk about Avon Barksdale
and Stringer Bell.

696
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:43,827
- Nah.
- You might as well give them what you have.

697
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,871
Anything you leave out
is outside the deal.

698
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:50,917
- They can charge you later.
- Fuck it then.

699
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:55,171
For another pit sandwich and some
potato salad, I'll go a few more.

700
00:52:57,967 --> 00:53:00,510
- How you want that?
- Medium rare, a lot of horseradish.

701
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:11,062
All right. I did Little Man, thinking he might
get weak on that cop getting shot.

702
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,939
Yeah? Where's the body?

703
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,275
Druid Hill.
Behind the reptile house.

704
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:18,444
You get back in them weeds,
you might find what's left of him.

705
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,281
All right, that's seven.
What else you got?

706
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:25,451
How about them witnesses?

707
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:31,249
The security lady, and whatshisname,
the maintenance man?

708
00:53:32,585 --> 00:53:35,128
- Gant?
- Yeah. Gant.

709
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:37,297
You did Gant alone?

710
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:43,761
They're out of potato salad.
I got slaw.

711
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:52,896
Information gleaned from surveillance shows
that Mr. Watkins a.k.a. Ronnie Mo,

712
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:57,233
was involved in the distribution
of heroin and cocaine in the high-rises

713
00:53:57,318 --> 00:54:00,320
at 734 Fayette and
221 North Fremont.

714
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,364
In exchange for his pleading guilty
to conspiracy,

715
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,826
he agrees to a sentence
not to exceed 15 years in DOC.

716
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,038
Mr. Watkins is on probation
for a drug distribution charge

717
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:13,166
adjudicated in Judge Prevas's court
in August, 2001...

718
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:20,006
Cedric, hey.

719
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:23,217
Major Cantrell.

720
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:26,012
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

721
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,848
- Where are they sending you?
- Northwest. Spurgeon's retiring.

722
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,978
- I heard that was happening.
- If ever you want a change, give a yell.

723
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:38,024
I could use a good shift lieutenant. Right
now, the whole fucking district's a mess.

724
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:40,610
- What isn't?
- Hey,

725
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:42,487
- good seeing you.
- You too.

726
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:52,121
You see, this ain't no DEU.
It ain't like that.

727
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,667
When you came downtown,
the job changed.

728
00:54:56,085 --> 00:55:01,047
Down here, we make big cases, big
hairy-balled cases like this Barksdale thing.

729
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:04,258
All that mess you call police
work down in the districts,

730
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:09,263
all that fuck-somebody-up and rip-and-run
bullshit. It won't play down here.

731
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:14,143
You think I'm kidding.
This is what makes cases, gentlemen. This!

732
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:17,438
Remember that.

733
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:33,955
Nicely done.

734
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:46,217
Motherfucker, I been here since lunch,
waiting.

735
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,594
Ain't nobody been through here.

736
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:52,557
You hear me? I been waiting
and y'all ain't about shit.

737
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:58,980
Yeah, listen to me. Look, if you feel
like that, then get off this phone.

738
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:01,816
Come down here and step
to me then, nigger.

739
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,609
All right.

740
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:09,115
Yo, if Roc-Roc ain't here in ten minutes
with my re-up, whoop his ass, man.

741
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,007
You did a tour in Homicide
years ago

742
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:30,094
but let me tell you how I run this unit,
because how I run it is how it runs.

743
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:33,264
We work on rotation.
You're up until you catch a call.

744
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:36,517
Then you step down
and someone else steps up behind you.

745
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:40,480
This is the way we do business in a town
with 250, 300 murders a year.

746
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:42,774
And it works.

747
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:47,153
You do not play the game for yourself,
you play it for us.

748
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:52,658
If you remember these few rules, you'll
find me to be supportive and reasonable.

749
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:54,327
Very reasonable, sir.

750
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:58,414
- That's what they say about me.
- They say that. They do.

751
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,025
Yo, D.

752
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:32,590
What the fuck was that?

753
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:36,410
You take a nigger's money,
then you serve him? What the fuck?

754
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,918
I'm saying, take their money,

755
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:46,629
then send them round
and let some other nigger serve.

756
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:51,300
The way you doing it, someone snapping
pictures got the whole deal. You hear?

757
00:57:57,933 --> 00:57:59,767
We got to tighten up
around here, yo.

758
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,319
Jimmy.

759
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:18,077
Hell of a case. Read all about it
in the papers. You done good, kiddo.

760
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,041
I gotta...

761
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:35,136
D'Angelo Barksdale supervised distribution
in the low-rise courtyards

762
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,764
and was also involved in the violence
attributed to the organization.

763
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:45,271
He was arrested in New Jersey possessing
heroin intended for distribution in Baltimore.

764
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:47,940
He acknowledges his role
as a conspirator

765
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:53,237
and is on parole for two earlier counts
of distribution dating from March, 1999.

766
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:57,241
- What are you asking?
- As he has two prior convictions

767
00:58:57,326 --> 00:59:02,246
and is insisting the effort to transport the kilo
was undertaken on his own behest,

768
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:05,541
and is refusing to cooperate
against others,

769
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:09,086
the state is offering only the maximum
allowable 20 years, Your Honor.

770
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:13,966
Mr. Levy, this is your understanding
of the plea agreement?

771
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:16,802
- Yes, sir.
- Very well then, Mr. Barksdale.

772
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:20,264
- Can you hear me distinctly?
- Yes.

773
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:22,350
Are you under the influence
of alcohol?

774
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:24,268
- Wee-Bey, man.
- How'd it go?

775
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:29,565
Life, no parole. He puts himself in for Orlando
and the attempt murder on Greggs.

776
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:37,573
He also takes Nakeisha Lyles, Diedre Kresson,
the two project murders that match that gun,

777
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:40,493
both the stick-up boys,
and Little Man.

778
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:41,827
Little Man?

779
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:44,622
Body found up behind
the reptile house in Druid Hill.

780
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:50,670
He gave us that one just for fun, I think.
He also takes William Gant.

781
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:55,007
- I know. It's bullshit.
- How'd he tell it?

782
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:57,468
Man.

783
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:02,056
- Boom.
- He said a contact wound? It doesn't play.

784
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,934
Gant had no compression,
no stippling.

785
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,645
Wound was to the front.
He's talking out of his ass.

786
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:10,314
But this motherfucker's
just taking murders just to take them.

787
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:14,026
He's taking life for shooting a cop,
what the fuck?

788
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:17,238
- Might as well spring Bird for killing Gant.
- All rise.

789
01:00:46,018 --> 01:00:48,269
Jesus, what the fuck did I do?

790
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:54,692
You happy now, bitch?

791
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:19,008
<i>Step by step</i>

792
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:22,386
<i>All the happy saints
go marching in</i>

793
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:25,723
<i>And if those saints
step out of line</i>

794
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,059
<i>You have to start again</i>

795
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,853
<i>Cos Jacob's golden ladder</i>

796
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:33,689
<i>Gets slippery at the top</i>

797
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:39,362
<i>And many a happy-go-lucky saint
has made that long, long drop</i>

798
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:42,281
<i>If I'm late, don't wait</i>

799
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,242
<i>Go on without me</i>

800
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:49,497
<i>I may tarry a while</i>

801
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:53,417
<i>Cos I need to know</i>

802
01:01:53,502 --> 01:01:56,253
<i>Before I go</i>

803
01:01:56,338 --> 01:02:00,925
<i>How come the devil smiles...</i>

804
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:27,284
How's it going, man?
How you doing?

805
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:29,537
<i>If I'm late, don't wait</i>

806
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:32,498
<i>Go on without me</i>

807
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:36,794
<i>I may tarry a while</i>

808
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:40,923
<i>Cos I need to know</i>

809
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:43,843
<i>Before I go</i>

810
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:48,431
<i>How come the devil smiles</i>

811
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:55,521
<i>Free from care, free from fear</i>

812
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:57,690
<i>The saints are trooping in</i>

813
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,110
<i>Children play
all around the throne</i>

814
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,571
<i>Innocent of sin</i>

815
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:06,699
<i>A trillion voices
sing the name</i>

816
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,701
<i>The mortal may not know</i>

817
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:14,123
<i>And heaven's walls too high to hear
the trouble down below</i>

818
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:17,126
<i>If I'm late, don't wait</i>

819
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:20,296
<i>Go on without me</i>

820
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:24,049

01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:28,387

<i>How come the devil smiles</i>

01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,648
<i>I need to know</i>

825
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,651
<i>Before I go</i>

826
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:44,028
<i>How come...</i>

827
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:53,704
Are you the man
with them jumbo sixes?

828
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:58,584
