1
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,016
How is she?

2
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,646
In and out of the morphine drip.

3
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,899
They got her stabilized
is all I know.

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,360
Go on in.

5
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:29,987
No.

6
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:33,282
Unfreeze your ass
off that wall then.

7
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,953
Either pay your respects
or get your head back into this case.

8
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,289
- Fuck this case.
- Fuck it?

9
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,084
You're just gonna call off
your little crusade?

10
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,671
Is that what you think it was?
A crusade?

11
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,048
Avon Barksdale was a way

12
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:50,550
to show everyone
how smart I was

13
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:51,634
and how fucked up

14
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,927
the department is,
that's all.

15
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,221
Just put Jimmy McNulty

16
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,431
up on your shoulders,

17
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:57,807
march him round the room,

18
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,851
break out the keg.

19
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,355
It was never about
Avon Barksdale, Lieutenant.

20
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,400
It was all about me.

21
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:09,527
You think I didn't know that?

22
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,739
You think we all didn't know?

23
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:21,247
Listen. This case is gonna move
forward with you or without you.

24
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,623
This case got her shot.

25
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,709
I put a battery up her ass

26
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,878
and got her thinking
it meant something.

27
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:28,838
And you know what?

28
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,340
Burrell, Rawls, and them,
they were right.

29
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,635
This case means exactly shit.

30
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:38,806
Well, I know it meant damn near nothing to me
when you came in beating the drum.

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,018
But now we got that woman in there,
that good police,

32
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,688
breathing through a fucking tube
because it meant something to her.

33
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:49,317
And the shooters who dropped Kima?
They're still in the wind.

34
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:53,196
And whoever sent those motherfuckers
into that alley, he needs to get got too.

35
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:58,743
You can stand there dripping with liquor
smell and self-pity if you got a mind to,

36
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:03,414
but this case,
it means something, now.

37
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,518
<i>If you walk through the garden</i>

38
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:26,604
<i>You better watch your back</i>

39
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:31,442
<i>Well, I beg your pardon</i>

40
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,445
<i>Walk the straight
and narrow track</i>

41
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:38,699
<i>If you walk with Jesus</i>

42
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,912
<i>He'll save your soul</i>

43
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:46,290
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

44
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,127
<i>Down in the hole</i>

45
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,756
<i>All the angels sing</i>

46
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:58,052
<i>About Jesus' mighty sword</i>

47
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:01,764
<i>And they shield you
with their wings</i>

48
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:05,810
<i>Keep you close to the Lord</i>

49
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,521
<i>Don't pay heed to temptation</i>

50
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:13,109
<i>For his hands are so cold</i>

51
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,612
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

52
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:20,616
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

53
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,877
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

54
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,922
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

55
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:39,802
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

56
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,264
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

57
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,274
You hit them again?

58
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,650
I been calling all morning.

59
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,319
They ain't hit me back yet.

60
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:59,155
Damn, we gonna tap out by noon.

61
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,408
Yo, Poot!
What we got over there?

62
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,410
200, maybe.

63
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,996
Shit.

64
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,456
What the fuck is this?

65
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,917
What the fuck you think, nigger?
Fish food.

66
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:13,669
Give me my shit.

67
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,384
Heads up.

68
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,553
String.

69
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,641
I need your pagers.
All y'all, the whole crew.

70
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,358
- Who else?
- Sterling, Cass and Manny.

71
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,361
- Go get them shits.
- How am I gonna talk to my girl?

72
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,488
Talk to your hand.
That's the only girl you got.

73
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:45,493
No more. Get out of here.
Just get the fuck out of here, man.

74
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:51,082
No more pagers.
Touts, lookouts, off the air, all right?

75
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,543
Nobody gonna use these cellphones
except for you and Bodie,

76
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,463
and y'all don't say shit on these,
you understand?

77
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,966
We the only niggers
that need them numbers.

78
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,052
Not your moms, not your girl, nobody.
You feel me?

79
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:08,891
You use these phones to set up a meet,
go to that meet and talk face to face, period.

80
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:12,311
- So no more payphones?
- You deaf? I said no phones.

81
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,563
How I'm gonna reach y'all?

82
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,235
All right, top number's for re-ups,

83
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,404
second number's for muscle.

84
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,072
You need me,
hit me on the third number.

85
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,825
Learn them shits,
then throw that shit away.

86
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,326
You doing this
in the towers too?

87
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:30,204
Doing it everywhere.
Payphones is dead.

88
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,539
All right?

89
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,623
Yeah.

90
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:38,337
Yo, String.
We need some re-up, man.

91
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:43,300
Re-up from where? You niggers ain't heard?
Narcos took the main stash.

92
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,428
Why the fuck you think
we changing up?

93
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,519
Back the fuck up, young'un.
These shits ain't for you.

94
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,398
All right.

95
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,820
Cool. There you go.

96
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,616
There we go. All right.

97
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,080
The gift of corrected vision.

98
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,249
Compliments of the BPD.

99
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,876
Dang, y'all are focused.

100
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,836
What man wouldn't be?

101
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:30,973
Excuse me.

102
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,021
They been cleaning us
for a few days.

103
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,983
- Last night they burned us all the way.
- I knew it. I fucking knew it.

104
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:45,488
- I'm in this motherfucker's head.
- Not a message since early morning.

105
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,782
I had to cut Prez loose.

106
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,284
- Send him down to Annapolis.
- For what?

107
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:55,623
State finance reports. I checked the stuff
here but Barksdale's money has legs.

108
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:59,502
Shit. All the work we did
to get up on this fucking wire.

109
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,838
You don't hit these guys
and expect them to stay in the pocket.

110
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,008
- They know they dropped a police.
- We need to change up too.

111
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:12,515
Come on. Shardene. Honey, this is
Detective McNulty who's working with us.

112
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,519
She works at Orlando's,
helping us out there from time to time.

113
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:20,231
And now I think that she can see
well enough to match faces to voices.

114
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:23,400
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.
I'm scared of this shit.

115
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,237
Time comes, though,
I know you gonna step up.

116
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,281
We need Pearlman
to approve her wearing a wire.

117
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,700
- Can I get a coffee?
- How do you take it?

118
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,745
I'll get it.
A little cream, right?

119
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,712
Those narco motherfuckers
cleaned my shit out.

120
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,006
You can replace product
and currency.

121
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,174
He right.

122
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,345
- We gotta focus on what's real here.
- All of this shit is real. All of it.

123
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,721
They wanna put me in a box.

124
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:56,016
I think what's important
is to take stock.

125
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,686
Ask yourself what's
out there that can hurt you.

126
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:02,439
Where are you weak?
Where you need to clean up?

127
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,197
Think it through.

128
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,367
Start with Orlando,
if Orlando rolled.

129
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,703
You know he talked about
the club, at least.

130
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,622
That punk-ass nigger
ain't talk about shit else.

131
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,875
That's all he knew about.
He wasn't with us.

132
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,418
We kept him on the outside.

133
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,587
So you walk away from the club.

134
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,922
You're not on the license,
you're not a listed owner.

135
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,718
- They can't make a connect.
- When did this shit start up?

136
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,388
About the time
that your nephew beat that charge.

137
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:40,769
When they found that witness with the lead
in his dome, the shit hit the newspapers.

138
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,355
But around that time,
the cops was on our shit.

139
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,525
The security guard
whose testimony sprung D'Angelo.

140
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,654
- Nakeisha Lyles?
- Bug-eyed ass bitch. But we hooked that up.

141
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,949
- So she can still hurt you, right?
- Yeah.

142
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,661
The point is anybody
who can hurt you can be put into play.

143
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,457
- The less I hear, the better.
- All right, yo.

144
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,001
Hey, yo, lock that door.

145
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,961
Lock that door.

146
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,425
So we got Bird and Bey.

147
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,427
Bird will stand tall.

148
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,096
He already in jail,
and Bey about to go too.

149
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,473
And Wee-Bey hard like a rock.

150
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,226
And we got Savino.

151
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,770
It ain't nothing but
an Arm & Hammer charge.

152
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,898
He ain't gonna flip out
over a motherfucking three years.

153
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:26,982
True.

154
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:31,403
Then we got that shit with Orlando,
and the only problem there was Little Man.

155
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,322
Was.

156
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,616
- Was.
- Was.

157
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,409
Who else?

158
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,247
It's over, your wire's cold.

159
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,166
The court orders give me
a total of 90 days on five phones.

160
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,668
I'm doing the full 90.

161
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:49,880
You want to sit listening to a bunch
of broke-ass pay phones, have at it.

162
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,758
But you don't need
all that manpower to do it.

163
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,344
You want some bodies back,
I'll send a couple.

164
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,347
Hold on, Lieutenant.
I gave you those people.

165
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,432
I decide who comes back.

166
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:04,520
But feel free to speak your mind,
if it were up to you.

167
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,315
He asked you a question,
Lieutenant.

168
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,361
I have no opinion.
Take your pick.

169
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,282
What's the name of that
old detective from Pawnshop?

170
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:21,036
And that young one,
Valchek's braindead son-in-law.

171
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:24,873
Freamon, Pryzbylewski.

172
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,042
Keep them.

173
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,629
Send back Sydnor and Santangelo.

174
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,010
And, Lieutenant,
if you want to do anything

175
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,762
beyond listening
to those dead phones,

176
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,224
you need to brief me first.

177
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,398
You did good, Cedric.

178
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:53,944
You play your cards right, all the work
you did over the past few months

179
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,988
will speak volumes for you.

180
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,742
Major Spurgeon says
he's retiring at the end of November.

181
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:03,245
- Opening up the Northwest Command.
- That's right.

182
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,417
Hi, Ronnie. Come in. Sit.

183
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:12,921
- Sheila, send Patrick in.
- Yes, sir.

184
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,299
- Anything up?
- With me?

185
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,009
Same shit, different file.

186
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,137
- How about the Barksdale thing?
- You got my office reports.

187
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,182
We're looking into a bug
in the man's nightclub.

188
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,726
Aside from that,
you're doing what?

189
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:30,356
Pulling campaign finance reports for every
politician in the city of Baltimore, right?

190
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:31,774
I am?

191
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:33,817
We are?

192
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,196
And making calls to
some contributors,

193
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,657
asking questions,
doing background checks.

194
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,993
I don't know anything
about this.

195
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,412
I mean, Ronnie,
where the fuck is all this going?

196
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,167
Those are public reports, right?
I mean...

197
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:54,380
No one on that detail has come
to me for any kind of subpoena.

198
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,840
You got back-doored too, huh?
Well...

199
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:02,971
Just so there's no misunderstanding,
I want to give you this.

200
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:07,393
Copies of checks on the account
of my re-election committee

201
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:12,648
representing the return of five separate
contributions, totaling $4,500.

202
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:18,153
Also copies of the checks from
the donor are represented in there too.

203
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,156
Kind of like Caesar's wife
and all that shit.

204
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:25,244
The only thing that we could
come up with were those five checks.

205
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,705
I don't know those people,
and I don't know why they gave.

206
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,500
That money's gonna be
returned to the donors.

207
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,503
Guys, listen to me.

208
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:40,217
I don't know a fucking thing about anyone
looking at campaign contributions.

209
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:46,098
Be that as it may, this should make it
clear that our hands are clean.

210
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,643
I want you to take that back
to whoever's on the hunt

211
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,439
and I want you to tell them
they've got no quarrel with me.

212
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,695
What's up, String?

213
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,577
So y'all want to get with me?

214
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:11,248
We need to holler at your boy. You know,
the one that dimed on Omar's bitch.

215
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,625
Can't recall his name.

216
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,586
Which one?

217
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,963
The one that was at the Greek's
that night.

218
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,966
- We paid him for the lookout.
- What y'all need him for?

219
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,511
What's it to you?

220
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,222
- You ain't got to worry about him.
- Say what?

221
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:31,101
- He's gone, he's out the game.
- Out the game?

222
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,896
The man asked you
a simple question.

223
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,775
I don't mean y'all no disrespect.
You know I don't.

224
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,570
I am sitting here telling you
that the boy is out the game.

225
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,948
Even if he wasn't out the game,
he wouldn't be no problem.

226
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,452
Well, you know we just want
to talk to him, D.

227
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,332
Avon...

228
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,919
let the boy be.

229
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,801
Just let him be.

230
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,270
Honey, just leave the damn
thing alone.

231
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,940
- Where'd you get these, man?
- Prevas.

232
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,108
Broadway market?

233
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:04,528
- Best chili dogs in the city.
- No, man, not even.

234
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,322
I'll give you ten bucks
if you can name a better dog.

235
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:11,118
- George's on Light Street.
- The Greek joint?

236
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:14,621
That closed when you were
still sucking on your mama's nipples.

237
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:17,624
My mama's nipples?
I was sucking on them last night.

238
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,251
You owe me ten.

239
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,504
I said name a better dog
you can have today, not in history.

240
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,465
You go get that dog right now.

241
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,595
- You cannot go get that now.
- You said the best fucking dog.

242
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,679
Can you please keep it down?

243
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,972
I can't hear a goddamn thing!

244
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:43,108
You'd know how much I got
if you laid something on me.

245
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,986
- You like that freeze?
- If you holding.

246
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:49,031
I'm fixing to be.
That's why I'm here, you know?

247
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,283
To discuss some things.

248
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,203
When you done discussing,
you come back.

249
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:04,254
All right, then.
Hold that pose right there, shorty.

250
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,465
I'm gonna hook you up
with some uncut.

251
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,636
Y'all niggers talk
too damn much, man.

252
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,771
Who the fuck is she?
Housing police?

253
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:25,067
No, she's one of them civilians
they got doing security.

254
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:29,404
- Housing cops wear the grey uniforms.
- So she's not armed or nothing.

255
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,906
Do she look it?

256
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,246
You leaving early?

257
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,707
I was early,
I worked the lunch crowd.

258
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,345
She's out.

259
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:56,515
Anything?

260
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:00,102
Scraps.
What we want is in that office.

261
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,772
There's no reason for Shardene to be
in there long enough for us to get it.

262
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,860
- Take it out, I can't do this any more.
- You won't have to.

263
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,780
I think they'll look at me and know.
I need to quit.

264
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:15,117
I don't need you wearing
this wire, all right, honey?

265
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,453
I just need you to go in there
and do one more thing.

266
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,248
Oh, look at this country nigger.

267
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,252
- Damn, Wallace.
- Wally!

268
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,881
He kept crying
till I sent him bus money.

269
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:34,136
All right. I just got tired
of that same old country scenery.

270
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,679
It was just too slow for me.

271
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,682
But did you get some
of that country ass?

272
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,559
If he did, it was on four legs.

273
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:44,896
Nigger, they got no farms down there, man.
They did have some Bamas though.

274
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,899
They got their Saturday night
shit down at Sears.

275
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:52,362
- They was like...
- You were about to cry. You got DieHards?

276
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,240
- These Timbs.
- Yeah, they Timbs.

277
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,534
I can see the tree
on the side of them.

278
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,494
So you gonna put me back
on the money?

279
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:06,001
Hold. Look, if we do put you back on,
you have to start as lookout, man.

280
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,087
You lost your spot
when you bucked town, dawg.

281
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:11,631
A real man would stay
with his people.

282
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,717
He wouldn't run at the first
sight of blood.

283
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,802
Y'all can still holler
Five-0, right?

284
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,095
If he want back on the money,

285
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,848
he back on the money.
If he want it.

286
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,642
My man might be
thinking of going back

287
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,978
to Edmondson like we talked
about, right?

288
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,359
Come on, nigger, let's walk.

289
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,613
Dawg, you ain't cornholed
no animal for real, did you?

290
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,449
- Go ahead, Poot.
- You're stupid.

291
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:40,285
Don't be fucking
with my Sean John.

292
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,789
- So who caught it?
- Garvey.

293
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:45,874
He knows about the witness angle

294
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:49,044
but he doesn't want to run it up
until he knows more.

295
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,088
Why ace Nakeisha Lyles now?

296
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:54,174
Now they know we're for real.

297
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,635
Avon's cleaning the house
all the way.

298
00:18:56,719 --> 00:19:00,722
First the phones go dead and then anyone
he thinks we might be able to flip.

299
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,896
What about the boy?

300
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,690
Fuck me.

301
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,320
We took him to the shore Friday.

302
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,823
The plan was to bring him back up
for the Grand Jury.

303
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,492
- What happened?
- Greggs got shot.

304
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,618
Trooper Reese?

305
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:24,663
This is Lieutenant Daniels,
Baltimore Department.

306
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:28,583
Can someone go near Cambridge and
check on a kid we got stashed down there?

307
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,710
- Call him.
- There's no phone.

308
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,295
- Can you hang on?
- I'll hold.

309
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,757
Have Sydnor pull a car
from motor pool.

310
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:40,595
We get the kid here. He sleeps on my sofa
and we Grand-Jury him in the morning.

311
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,766
- What about your stripper?
- The woman's got heart.

312
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:48,228
I mean, I want her protected.
No more bodies, hear?

313
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,730
I got room at my place,
she can lay up with me.

314
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:54,234
- I got no problem with that.
- Remember who you are, Detective.

315
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:59,531
Protect and serve, Lieutenant.
Protect and serve.

316
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:04,452
I'm saying, this here game,
it ain't gonna work for you no more, man.

317
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,790
You leaving,
you stirred up some shit.

318
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,877
- I'm saying it ain't your fault.
- D, look.

319
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:16,298
I appreciate what you trying to say and all,
but I grew up in the courts, all right?

320
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:19,426
I been with them niggers
since forever.

321
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,597
I guess this is home, right?

322
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,182
You ain't hearing me, Wallace.

323
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:27,767
You ain't hearing me.

324
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:32,647
Anybody asks you whether you in this game,
you tell them you in it for life, all right?

325
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:37,527
Play it hard, play it tight and make sure
niggers know you stand by your people.

326
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,822
No loose talk,
no second thoughts, and no snitching.

327
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,075
Play it like that.

328
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,250
Hey.

329
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:55,337
- What you doing down in the PJs? Lost?
- I'm looking for you.

330
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,796
You know I be down here working.

331
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,174
A working man got to eat.

332
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:04,471
- My favorite spicy fish cakes?
- On the saltines with the mustard.

333
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,389
You gonna make me cry,
you know.

334
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,850
I need to get up out of here
and get back to it.

335
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,395
- You be safe.
- You too.

336
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,605
All right.

337
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,068
This here.

338
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,321
Sterling's, baby,
we're about to feast.

339
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,239
What the hell is Sterling's?

340
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,034
Sterling's on 29th Street?
Don't you know nothing?

341
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,329
Shit, if it ain't up
on the Westside, I don't know shit.

342
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,166
Cos this shit,
this is me, yo, right here.

343
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,045
Who was that,
your new girl or something?

344
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,047
No, nigger, that's my mom.

345
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,224
You know Senator Davis?

346
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,226
No, sir.

347
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,561
Lieutenant.

348
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:58,024
Clay wanted to meet you,
see if there was any help he can offer.

349
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,361
Help?

350
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:05,031
Your people are apparently
pulling finance reports

351
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,867
and checking up on
some of the contributors.

352
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,245
I wanted to reassure you
on that front.

353
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,164
I'm not involved in drugs,
Lieutenant.

354
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:15,625
Good.

355
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,878
And this business
with the senator's driver.

356
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,590
- Mr. Price, Damien.
- Day-Day.

357
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,930
This... This business with Mr. Price,
this is a misunderstanding

358
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:31,349
that is really of no concern
to the police.

359
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,353
We hid $20,000 of cash on him

360
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,857
delivered out of a project tower
by a known drug suspect.

361
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,818
The money was banded
and manicured by denomination.

362
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,528
This is...

363
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,781
There's no crime here.

364
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:51,161
That was money that Damien already had
on him when he drove to Franklin Terrace.

365
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:54,789
Money from a cash-bar fundraiser
the previous weekend.

366
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:58,376
We filed an amended
finance report that shows that...

367
00:22:58,461 --> 00:22:59,544
Fine.

368
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:04,299
There's no probable cause
for a search of Mr. Price.

369
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,343
I think we are
in agreement on that.

370
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,888
No, there was PC for the search.

371
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:14,059
You're saying you have evidence that
a senatorial aide is involved in drugs?

372
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:18,855
I'm saying we had reason
to stop Mr. Price and search him,

373
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:23,443
after which we discovered $20,000
in cash, in banded, manicured bills.

374
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,944
That's all I'm saying.

375
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:29,908
Explain to this motherfucker
just what it is he's doing here.

376
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,910
- Lieutenant Daniels?
- Excuse me, sir.

377
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,037
But it's pretty basic.

378
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,916
If the senator is not involved in anything
illegal then he doesn't need to worry.

379
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,460
I can't be any clearer
about it than that.

380
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,087
Fool, what do you think?

381
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,964
That we know anything
about who gives money?

382
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:48,843
That we give a damn about
who they are or what they want?

383
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:52,347
We have no way of running down
them or their stories.

384
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:57,227
We don't care. We just cash the damn
checks, count the votes, and move on.

385
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,566
Anything else, Deputy Burrell?

386
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,154
Gentlemen.

387
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:18,706
You need to put his ass on a foot
post so far out in the sticks

388
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,751
that he's gonna see the Philadelphia
cops walking towards him.

389
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,088
Now you just ain't talking
to me now, Erv.

390
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:30,343
You talking to the Mayor, the city
caucus, the state central committee.

391
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:33,054
And right now,
you got your hand in our pocket.

392
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,223
18, baby!

393
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:41,896
Eight-eight-eight-eight-eight-eight-eight-
eight-eight-eight-eight-eight-eight.

394
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,232
18 with a bullet, baby.

395
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:48,278
Detective Sergeant Hauk
reporting for duty, sir.

396
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,866
And the best part?
Carver's 37.

397
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,702
You know, it helps
if you know them by the numbers.

398
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,912
It makes you sound
more professional.

399
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:02,375
Fucking Carver. He gets back from training,
he's gonna kiss the stripes.

400
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,377
I'm gonna make him kiss
the stripes.

401
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,589
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.

402
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,386
- Sergeant Hauk?
- God help us.

403
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:19,934
- Daniels.
- Daniels, this is Trooper Reese.

404
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,604
Grandmother says this kid's
been gone two days.

405
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:25,982
Wallace is out of pocket.
Two days.

406
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,985
Thanks.

407
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,160
Ain't no re-up in the towers,
neither?

408
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,412
No. Shop dead, yo.

409
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,809
- What up, man?
- Same old, same old.

410
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,396
What's up with that boy?

411
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:08,733
Oh, man.
He just a punk, that's all.

412
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,653
D put him back on count though.

413
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,489
Word?
I heard he was out the game.

414
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,325
He was, but he back now.

415
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,661
Where he been at?

416
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,413
Down his granny house,
he says.

417
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:24,749
His granny.

418
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,169
I heard he damn near shit
his pants when

419
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,255
he saw what happened
to Omar's bitch.

420
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:35,301
He just ain't built for this, you know.
His heart pump Kool-Aid.

421
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:38,554
Right. What about you?

422
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:40,765
You built for this shit?

423
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,102
No doubt.

424
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:47,939
You ready to put the work in?

425
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:52,944
You got heat?

426
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:03,746
All right, soldier.

427
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:42,952
It's clear upstairs.

428
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:58,092
- No extension cords. No juice boxes.
- No Wallace.

429
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:04,432
Dang, boy, Chink Bob's
never be putting no napkins in the bag.

430
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:07,310
Motherfucker.
Napkins expensive and shit.

431
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,978
So is my money.

432
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:11,981
All right, come on, go.
Something to eat?

433
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,776
Y'all know what's here.

434
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:21,783
Y'all need to get up in this Chinese food
cos I'm looking needy right about now.

435
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:27,455
What you listening to?
Hold up, take them plates first.

436
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,083
Big Tymers, their new video
on 106th and Park.

437
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,668
- 106th and Park?
- The joint is vicious.

438
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,463
- What they call you?
- Buff, cos I got the stuff.

439
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,509
You got the stuff? You need to get up
in these egg rolls or something.

440
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,387
Any word on the kid?

441
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,473
I rolled around Cambridge
all night with his B of I.

442
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,351
If he's down there,
he ain't got no profile.

443
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,978
We got lookouts to every car.

444
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:53,147
We're trying for an address
on his mother.

445
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:57,485
- Detective.
- Lieutenant.

446
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:01,489
Wire's dead so we've been ordered
to begin sending bodies home.

447
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,909
Sydnor, we have a little longer
because Cantrell still owes me.

448
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:08,496
- You OK with Rawls?
- I gave him his clearance, right?

449
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:09,831
What's he gonna do to me?

450
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,834
Keep it warm, Sanny.

451
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:20,174
What's that?

452
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:24,429
- Plans for Orlando's. The upper floors.
- This is the property next door.

453
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,639
- How'd you get them so quick?
- CoStar.

454
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:31,018
Plan is to get a remote mike into the office.
Maybe even some fiber optics.

455
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,521
Only we don't know
where Avon's office is.

456
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,690
Which is where Shardene
helps us out.

457
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:39,444
Is she gonna take out a tape
and ask Avon to hold the other end?

458
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,529
Ain't none of y'all been
in the military?

459
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:43,865
How do you learn a 30-inch,
quick-time?

460
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,705
Draft-dodging peace freaks.

461
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,542
- Get me a ruler and some string.
- Why me?

462
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,137
Why? Why?

463
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,765
- Because the man said so, that's why.
- Wallace ain't no snitch.

464
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:12,685
Man, how you know?
How you know where he been running to?

465
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:16,189
He was getting high.
I've seen him cop.

466
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,692
He probably went down
to the shore to clean that shit up.

467
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:25,072
Man, if he using, then you know
he ain't reliable. Come on, think.

468
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:30,077
Look, the man gave the word, all right?
We either step up or we step the fuck off.

469
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,831
That's the game.

470
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,917
That's the fucking game.

471
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,677
Cedric.

472
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:52,934
You ever hear of an elected official
in Baltimore giving money back?

473
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,231
Whatever you're doing
scared my boss shitless.

474
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,067
He calls me in and hands me that.

475
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:10,993
Forgive me for prying
into the details of our investigation.

476
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:14,872
I know, it's annoying.
But what the hell are you guys doing?

477
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,626
Is that Avon's money?

478
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:26,092
Eastside addresses but maybe Barksdale
has fronts we don't know about.

479
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:29,470
- State's Attorney's returning this?
- Fast as he can.

480
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:32,682
Y'all are stirring some shit here.
Why didn't you tell me?

481
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,226
Aren't you better off
that we didn't?

482
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,002
I remember my mom used to
bring me here.

483
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,920
We used to go to
Fruit Fantasy.

484
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:04,672
Orange soda,
some shit like that?

485
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,173
No, these were fresh.

486
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,301
My mom poured Bacardi
in hers though.

487
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:12,972
- Wasn't much she didn't pour it into.
- Talking about her like you're still a kid.

488
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,057
I got to thinking on her.

489
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,852
Your ass ain't got
to be hard all the goddamn time.

490
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,187
Soft link break the chain.

491
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,484
What are you, a boy or a man?

492
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:27,778
I'm a man.

493
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,995
So what are we gonna do, man,
go have some fun?

494
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,061
OK, on this floor.
It's the second room from the rear.

495
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:05,274
The stairs start 30 paces from the front.
There's 24 stairs, about a foot each.

496
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:09,612
When you get to the top floor, it's eight
paces to the door of the dressing room

497
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,739
and another 10 to the back room.

498
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:14,200
80 to 110 in from the front.

499
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,915
The third floor of this
building is vacant.

500
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:23,918
Otherwise we'd need a warrant.

501
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,756
- $15.
- Here take $10.

502
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,883
- $15.
- Motherfucker, I don't see no meter.

503
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,927
Get the fuck out of here.

504
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,934
It's 2:30 in the morning.

505
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,855
Easy now. Hole only needs
to be as big as your finger.

506
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,692
Not those sausage fingers you got.

507
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,443
You know what big hands mean.

508
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:53,489
You know what big hands mean, right?

509
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,660
Lieutenant, I just pulled a fresh
address for Wallace's mother.

510
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,830
We're OK here.

511
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,920
Where y'all at?

512
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:14,343
All right, when I find y'all,
y'all gonna get it.

513
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,554
You better come out now.

514
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,685
Where y'all at?

515
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,317
Look, I'm not even playing
with y'all right about now.

516
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:31,527
You hear me?

517
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,623
Game over.
Where the fuck y'all at?

518
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:49,503
When I find y'all, I'm beating your asses.
Now where y'all at?

519
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,922
Don't let me find y'all.

520
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,641
Check this, Poot.
Little Man left his player and shit.

521
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,073
Yo, man, you...

522
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,367
You a weak-ass nigger, man.

523
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,705
You should've stayed down
in the country, man.

524
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,082
Y'all my niggers, yo.

525
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,210
You fucking brought this
on yourself.

526
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,378
- We boys!
- You brought this on yourself.

527
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,964
Why it gotta be like this?

528
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:36,425
You my niggers from BC,
remember that?

529
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:40,471
Come on, wetting your fucking pants,
like you a little boy.

530
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:43,766
Be a man!
Stand up like a motherfucking man.

531
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,728
- Y'all my niggers.
- You said you a fucking man. Stand up.

532
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:50,314
That's us, man.

533
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,571
Do it, goddamnit, if you...

534
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,485
Darcia Wallace?
We're looking for your son.

535
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,988
Thought you might know
his whereabouts.

536
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:44,660
Where-a-who? Shit, I be looking for that
smart little nigger too. Boy took me for $10.

537
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,704
- Recently?
- What's going on?

538
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:47,788
Nothing.

539
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:53,460
Couple of police interrupting me,
while I'm trying to get my drink on.

540
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:57,381
- Your son might be in danger.
- He will be if he shows up.

541
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,884
Snatched that $10 out my purse.

542
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:03,178
- I'll slap the bright out his eyes.
- Here's my card.

543
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:06,140
You run into him, you call me.

544
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,541
- Y'all got a tape?
- Over there, man.

545
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,712
All right, let's see
what we got here.

546
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:41,300
He's packing shit up.

547
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:03,530
What you scratching
your head for, man?

548
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:06,200
How y'all get the safe in here,
and you can't get it out?

549
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,662
Just dial 911 and talk
to whoever pick up.

550
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:11,455
Don't say your name or nothing.

551
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:16,377
Just say there's been an animal hurt
inside the house and then you hang up.

552
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,259
What up?
So what do you need from me?

553
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,892
I need you to run up to NYC
to pick up a little something.

554
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,812
Look, I know
we tapped and all.

555
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:37,898
Everybody waiting on the re-up,
but I never made that run before.

556
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:42,778
I feel like I don't have that many people
around me I could really trust.

557
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,197
Not like I can kin.
You follow me?

558
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,575
- All right?
- How much is it?

559
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,995
We just need to maintain.

560
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,206
Put out enough so we can
keep hold of them towers.

561
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:00,129
- When?
- Tonight.

562
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:05,009
All right.

563
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:09,388
- What am I driving?
- A rental, nothing flash.

564
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:10,514
Where from?

565
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:14,268
I don't know where from, man,
one of those places by the airport.

566
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:18,188
- Yeah.
- We got something real.

567
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,441
- I'm on my way.
- All right.

568
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,712
Shit!

569
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,092
- Which one?
- The rental there, the Taurus.

570
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,979
I gotta say, Lieutenant,
you got mad suction with the federales.

571
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,006
Yeah, Daniels.

572
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,179
Yeah.

573
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:34,431
Where?

574
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:39,686
Wallace?

575
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:24,398
Poor fucking kid.

576
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,695
With Wallace gone,
that's Stringer out of the box.

577
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:43,000
He was in there changing
his fucking clothes.

578
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,628
You believe that?

579
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:49,256
Boy had to get himself correct.

580
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,187
We're on. No need for an eyeball.
Let the satellite do the work.

581
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:24,291
How about I call my lawyer, have him explain
that whole profiling thing to you?

582
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:30,964
Mr. Barksdale, our tollbooth cameras
have you on the GW Bridge at 23:10 hours,

583
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:34,843
then re-entering the turnpike
at the same exit 35 minutes later.

584
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:38,472
Why did you drive all the way
to New York for half an hour?

585
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:43,644
Step out of the car, sir.
Keep your hands where I can see them.

586
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,772
Turn around, face the car,
hands on the roof.

587
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,441
- Are you carrying any weapons, sir?
- No.

588
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,151
- Knives, any needles?
- No.

589
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:54,029
Any illegal substances
I should know about?

590
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:56,740
OK. Spread your legs back.

591
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,951
Spread your legs back more.

592
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:06,083
OK, slowly bring
your right arm around your back.

593
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,918
Now bring the other one.

594
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:24,226
- Remember me?
- Lawyer.

595
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:26,728
Easy.
We're just getting started.

596
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:30,857
- Lawyer, motherfucker.
- OK, so you're hard, but guess what?

597
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:34,444
- I could give a fuck.
- You? I'm tired of your games.

598
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,989
You want me to write a letter,
or some shit like that?

599
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:40,575
No game we need to run.
You're popped with a kilo of uncut.

600
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,954
Not that you messed up.
You did everything right.

601
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,581
Speed limit, turn signals,
working tail-lights.

602
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:50,294
Question you gotta ask is how'd
those troopers know to pull you over?

603
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:52,921
Someone else fucked up.
You following me?

604
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:56,508
But it's you they're gonna blame
and you who's gonna do the jolt.

605
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:00,846
- Lawyer.
- That'd be Levy, right?

606
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,225
He's getting paid by your uncle,
is that right?

607
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:08,270
He's looking out for
your interests.

608
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:09,771
More than you.

609
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:12,024
Listen.

610
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,736
I ain't saying
another damn thing

611
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,238
to nobody but my lawyer.

612
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:28,707
Oh, by the way, your boy Wallace,
shot dead in the low-rises.

613
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,293
That's how y'all take
care of your own, right?

614
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,755
You're a lying motherfucker.

615
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:40,177
So what? You want me to write
a letter to his mom too?

616
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:42,971
Get the fuck out of here.

617
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,113
You didn't have
to send him the way you did.

618
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:04,701
In one car?
He should've been trailing a mule.

619
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:09,039
95 or on the train, it don't make no difference.
He shouldn't have been alone.

620
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,792
- Look here, Brianna.
- Ain't you ever heard of a trap-car?

621
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:16,922
You send my son to New York
in a motherfucking rental

622
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:19,007
and let him ride
with that package in the trunk?

623
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,052
- I'm sorry.
- That won't bring him out of prison.

624
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:25,639
Better make sure that Jew lawyer of yours
earns his money, huh, eh?

625
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,975
- D'Angelo has to do his part.
- Meaning what?

626
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,478
You like the car
you driving in, right?

627
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:35,148
You like this crib?
I put you in this crib. You like it?

628
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:39,194
We all got a lot to protect here.
You need to remind him of that.

629
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,155
So when it come down to it,
he can stand up tall.

630
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,289
You ain't gotta worry
about my child.

631
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:55,502
I raised that boy,
and I raised him right.

632
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,346
It wasn't me who fucked up.

633
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:11,768
Really? So who did?
Why the fuck are we here?

634
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:15,272
All you need to do is keep
your head through the bail hearing.

635
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:19,693
- We've got a shot at bringing you home.
- Then what? Huh?

636
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:24,364
Who gonna take the weight for all
the shit in the trunk of that car?

637
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,579
Where's Wallace at?

638
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,460
Where's the boy, String?

639
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,007
D'Angelo, shut your mouth.

640
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:46,678
Where's Wallace?

641
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,346
That's all I want to know.

642
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,724
Kid, you'd better think.

643
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,977
Where the fuck is Wallace?

644
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,480
Huh, String? String?

645
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,690
Look at me. Look at me!

646
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,192
Where the fuck is Wallace?

647
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:03,653
I don't want this motherfucker
representing me.

648
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,530
I'm gonna get my own man.

649
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:07,032
So just get back in your car

650
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:09,326
and get the fuck back
down south.

651
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:13,371
All right, you stupid motherfucker.
You made your decision.

652
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,665
I made my decision.
Where's Wallace at?

653
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,752
Where the fuck is Wallace?
Where's Wallace?

654
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,922
String!
Where the fuck is Wallace?

655
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,882
God damn!

656
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:25,842
Bring him in, you're done.

657
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:26,927
Why?

658
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:29,679
We have the charge
whenever we want it.

659
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:31,973
Why not stay up on the bug
in his office?

660
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:34,434
The bug you didn't brief me about.

661
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:39,439
I thought your little bird told you everything
we did a minute after we did it.

662
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,442
One of ours got hurt.
That should mean something.

663
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:47,864
We're hunting her shooters and
by the grace of God and your good work,

664
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:50,367
we've got a viable case on our main target.

665
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:54,371
Just charge Barksdale
with the attempt purchase from New York

666
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:56,164
and bring it all home.

667
00:47:56,332 --> 00:48:00,001
What about Stringer? He slipped
off the hook when we lost the boy.

668
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:02,128
We've done all we can.

669
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:04,464
Are you hearing me?

670
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:06,132
These are the people responsible

671
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,592
for dropping a police.

672
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:09,052
Not just the shooters,

673
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,845
but ones who make
the dirt happen.

674
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:12,514
I'm trying to put them
down for real,

675
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:13,848
not for some short-time bit.

676
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:17,102
That all you trying to do?

677
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,897
If it is, how is it
you have people pulling

678
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:23,567
campaign records
and finance reports?

679
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:24,734
The fuck has that

680
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:26,361
got to do with anything?

681
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:28,572
The money is part of my case.

682
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,908
I was willing to say otherwise,

683
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:35,078
to let your friends
hide some of that dirt, but not now.

684
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,622
You want to talk about dirt?
Have at it.

685
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,208
Talk about your Eastern
district days.

686
00:48:40,293 --> 00:48:42,377
Talk about what was going on

687
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,462
when you ran wild in the DEU.

688
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:46,047
That's just talk.

689
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:47,966
Just talk?

690
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:57,517
FBI field reports.

691
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,855
You came into
a lot of money, quick.

692
00:49:02,732 --> 00:49:07,902
And you can go to jail just as quick
if I start asking the right questions.

693
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,864
This case ends,
or you are done.

694
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:14,326
Hell, I don't even need you
to lock up Barksdale.

695
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:18,455
I'll have your major debrief your detectives
and type the warrants himself.

696
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:21,541
This case is done.

697
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,213
You do what you feel.

698
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:30,967
You wanna pull Avon in on
half a case? You go ahead.

699
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,261
You wanna put my shit
in the street?

700
00:49:33,346 --> 00:49:34,346
Feel free.

701
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,890
But the Eastern had
a lot of stories.

702
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,642
Mine ain't the only one.

703
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:41,061
A lot of people came
through that district.

704
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:43,271
If you were gonna do me,

705
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:45,023
I'd already be done.

706
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,983
But there ain't nothing
you fear more

707
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:49,486
than a bad headline now,
is there?

708
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:50,862
You'd rather live in shit

709
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,323
than let the world see
you work a shovel.

710
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,993
You can order warrants,
and I'll serve them.

711
00:49:57,078 --> 00:49:58,828
But as long as I have days left

712
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:01,790
on those dead wires,
this case goes on.

713
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:17,013
Yo, look at these Delta Force
motherfuckers, man.

714
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:19,099
- Look at them.
- All right.

715
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:24,104
- What's up with Levy?
- He said he gonna meet us down there.

716
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:27,440
I still didn't get this safe out
of here yet, man. How much money in it?

717
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:30,318
- $150,000.
- $150,000.

718
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:34,531
Open it up, man.
No sense in ruining a good safe.

719
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:56,136
This isn't as much fun
as I thought it would be.

720
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,346
The SWAT love to break
out their toys.

721
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:01,683
Do they think it's Tony Montana?
They probably haven't touched a gun in years.

722
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:06,813
Fuck this shit.

723
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:09,607
You and me, Lieutenant.

724
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:15,613
What units are in the alley?

725
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,117
Any sightline to the rear door?

726
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:22,662
10-4, who has the roof?

727
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:26,583
We're gonna move in on my command.
Everyone stand by.

728
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:30,253
We're not gonna need
your men today.

729
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:33,214
- Now wait a minute.
- My case. Back your men off.

730
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:32,023
Catch you later.

731
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,226
It's good.

732
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,565
Barksdale's wearing bracelets.

733
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,903
Still no Wee-Bey, no Little Man?

734
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:02,280
No, nothing there.

735
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:17,837
This is the best work I ever did. I never
did a case like this. But it's not enough.

736
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:22,258
I gotta go back to Auto
tomorrow morning and...

737
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:26,387
- I just feel like this just ain't finished.
- Detective.
