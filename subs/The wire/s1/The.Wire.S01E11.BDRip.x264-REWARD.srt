1
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:17,058
Come on. Come on!

2
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,186
Another bag here.

3
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,610
Christ.

4
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:31,322
- Sergeant?
- Yeah?

5
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:38,329
- Who are the primaries?
- Cole and Norris.

6
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:42,083
Cole's here and Norris
is at the hospital.

7
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,587
- What do you need?
- Room to work.

8
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,631
I keep ordering people
off the scene,

9
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:51,718
and between Narcotics,
DEA and the two districts,

10
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:54,762
we keep collecting more
and more bodies around here.

11
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:58,307
Nobody move!

12
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,018
I said nobody fucking move!

13
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:06,566
If you have not been assigned a task
by a Homicide detective,

14
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,484
step away from this crime scene.

15
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:13,406
Is there anybody doesn't
understand a direct order?

16
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:19,245
If you have not specifically
been instructed otherwise,

17
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:23,124
then remove your useless,
interfering asses from the area.

18
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,294
Now!

19
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,425
Slow this thing down to a crawl.

20
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:36,512
Give these bastards no chance
to fuck up in a meaningful way.

21
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:46,022
- Wedged all the way to the back.
- She couldn't get to it.

22
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,025
She taped it up front.

23
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:53,571
But as soon as she put any weight on these
worn-ass car seats, they pulled the tape off.

24
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:56,324
Gun slid back behind the mesh
as they drove, probably.

25
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,702
Christ.

26
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:06,334
- Where was her support?
- There were two cars several blocks distant.

27
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:10,713
She got turned around in the alleys.
She gave her 20 at the north side of Warwick.

28
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,799
They went there on the shots?

29
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,678
Foxtrot finally found her.

30
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:22,433
So, we had two units covering the north side
and a helicopter up on top,

31
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:24,769
and no one saw
any vehicles in flight.

32
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:42,203
Bunk. Terry, Mike, come on.

33
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,753
What the fuck happened?

34
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:26,664
<i>If you walk through the garden</i>

35
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,750
<i>You better watch your back</i>

36
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:34,463
<i>Well, I beg your pardon</i>

37
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,216
<i>Walk the straight
and narrow track</i>

38
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,345
<i>If you walk with Jesus</i>

39
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,974
<i>He'll save your soul</i>

40
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,228
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

41
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,731
<i>Down in the hole</i>

42
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,485
<i>All the angels sing</i>

43
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,947
<i>About Jesus' mighty sword</i>

44
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,576
<i>And they shield you
with their wings</i>

45
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:08,706
<i>Keep you close to the Lord</i>

46
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,626
<i>Don't pay heed to temptation</i>

47
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:16,005
<i>For his hands are so cold</i>

48
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,508
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

49
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:23,512
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

50
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:34,023
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

51
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,860
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

52
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,740
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

53
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,660
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

54
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,377
You didn't have an eyeball?

55
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,380
On those streets,
there's no way you can eyeball it.

56
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:01,676
- She threw out 20s as best she could.
- Understood, I'm just asking.

57
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,472
The link we have to this is Savino Bratton,
a minor lieutenant to our target, Barksdale.

58
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:10,017
- I gave you people all that.
- We're hitting his last-knowns.

59
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,728
The set-up was more than him. The casings
are different calibers

60
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,022
and her Glock was full up.

61
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,151
- How bad?
- Chest wound, no exit.

62
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,028
Through and through to the throat.

63
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,532
They had the pressure pants on her
to push up the pulse.

64
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,242
They put those pants on you,
it ain't good.

65
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,579
OK.

66
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:34,542
You're on Baker when you hear the shots.
Where was the second car?

67
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:37,628
- Warwick, I think.
- OK. You've got the east well covered.

68
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:40,339
- To the west is the rail bed.
- What did Foxtrot see?

69
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:43,509
- Nothing moving except our units.
- Lieutenant.

70
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:49,098
I know just how you feel. This is
the toughest job a police commissioner has.

71
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,725
I don't think
I'll ever get used to it.

72
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,185
This is Lieutenant Daniels.

73
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,357
Oh. Right. Right, of course.

74
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:04,238
This entire department stands behind
Detective Greggs in every possible way.

75
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:09,160
- I just thought you should know that.
- Yes, sir.

76
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,545
Jaybird.

77
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,595
We have a runner.

78
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,140
Yeah, we're gonna need casts
of these two imprints.

79
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,225
Put the lab tech on it.

80
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,567
The money's not anyone's primary concern.
I understand that.

81
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:46,363
I won't give a shit about the money when you
have lost one of your own who might...

82
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,657
I mean, Jesus, this is awful.

83
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,702
- But if we can get to this Savino character...
- Hey.

84
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,706
Fuck your money.

85
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,175
Jimmy?

86
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,430
You hurt?

87
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,557
No.

88
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,021
It's hers.

89
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,446
Come on, get up. Let's go. Up with you.
Come on.

90
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,666
She couldn't talk, couldn't breathe.
Nothing.

91
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,293
She went into the ambo that way.

92
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,880
Is she...?

93
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:51,762
- What the fuck did I do?
- Come on, walk.

94
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,767
What's that?

95
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,908
- What's our plan, Ray?
- Bunk and Jay stay with the scene.

96
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,203
Keeley and Crutchfield are at the office
typing warrants.

97
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,455
- Who's on the autopsy?
- Me, I'm at the morgue.

98
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:22,710
Norris and Holley stay at shock trauma
in case she sits up and talks.

99
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:26,422
- We're laser printing the car, right?
- Course. Worden's on that.

100
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,926
- You're in command for the city, right?
- Major Rawls, Homicide.

101
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:36,182
Anything you need from my office.
Men, money, whatever, you just ask.

102
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,851
Right.

103
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,611
Cooperator,
your girl's down shock trauma.

104
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,451
- Let's get to work.
- Fuck you.

105
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:59,622
- Fuck me? We got a wire up.
- So?

106
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,499
We got a wire up on some motherfucker
that shot a cop.

107
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,545
If somebody says the wrong fucking thing
about what happened,

108
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,464
where the fuck
do you want to be?

109
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,885
Church roof?

110
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,805
Yeah, you and me. Sydnor takes
the McCullough Street phone.

111
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,601
Anybody get in contact
with Kima's people?

112
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,145
Shit.

113
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,607
I'll do that first and
meet you at the church.

114
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,792
Bunk, Mike.

115
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,893
Wonder who that bitch was.

116
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:04,979
- Always some shit, right?
- Yeah.

117
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,441
- Done?
- Done.

118
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:10,985
All right.

119
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,237
Let's get outta here.

120
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,162
Yeah.

121
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,583
Lab tech to this spot.
Photos and casts.

122
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,714
Can I get 18-12 up here?

123
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,719
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

124
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,558
You're camped here.
Nobody touches this shit,

125
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,061
or even comes near it,
till the tech does his recovery.

126
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,073
Hello.

127
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:03,829
- He stopped running.
- Either he got tired or...

128
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,665
- Or he got into a car.
- Right.

129
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,834
- 11-34.
- Go ahead, 11-34.

130
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:13,589
I'm in the 3000 block of Landvale,

131
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,258
backing up to the CSX bed.

132
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,762
I need a lab unit and
a DPW crew with a jackhammer.

133
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:23,474
- A jackhammer?
- Gonna keep a bit of road, KGA.

134
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:31,857
- Alive. In the OR.
- My people at the scene have heard this.

135
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,484
It's a copy of the original.

136
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,487
- We brought a machine... Where the fuck is...
- Sir.

137
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,614
Here it is.

138
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,672
- Don't fuck with this count.
- That's Savino.

139
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,966
I'll be right back
with your shit.

140
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:03,263
Where are we? That sign said
Longwood but I could swear this is Warwick.

141
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:06,392
The hoppers be turning the sign poles
to fuck with you all.

142
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:11,522
I make it we're on the north side of Warwick,
in an alley, I don't know, shit...

143
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,649
half a block west of Longwood, maybe?

144
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,735
I hope you all copy that.
This got the right feel for you?

145
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,738
He better not be long
cos I don't know where the stash is,

146
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,741
and if they dragging us all over
this part of town...

147
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:25,869
- What's that?
- Jesus.

148
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:29,915
- Something ain't right. This shit ain't right.
- Christ.

149
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,002
Signal 13, signal 13.

150
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:37,548
- Where the fuck...?
- She can't reach the gun.

151
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,759
- What the fuck?
- Two males, black hoodies, both armed...

152
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,264
Shut it off. Shut it off.

153
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,333
Listen to me, you fuck.
You did a lot of shit here.

154
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,502
You played a lot of fucking cards

155
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,630
and made a lot of people do a lot of
fucking things they didn't want to do.

156
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,718
This is true.
We both know this is true.

157
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:30,809
You, McNulty, are a gaping asshole.
We both know this.

158
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,645
Fuck if everybody in CID
doesn't know it.

159
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,397
But fuck if I'm gonna stand here

160
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,108
and say you did a single fucking thing
to get a police shot.

161
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,986
You did not do this,
you fucking hear me?

162
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:47,701
This is not on you. No, it isn't, asshole.
Believe it or not, everything isn't about you.

163
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,581
And the motherfucker saying this,
he hates your guts, McNulty.

164
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:57,753
So you know if it was on you,
I'd be the son of a bitch to say so.

165
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:06,720
Shit went bad.
She took two for the company.

166
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,015
That's the only lesson here.

167
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,813
Police!

168
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,857
Police, let me see your hands.

169
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,109
- Hands on your head!
- Down on the ground!

170
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,362
Search warrant,
get on the ground.

171
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,781
Police. Get down.

172
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,700
Let's see your hands.

173
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,869
- He ain't here!
- Who ain't here?

174
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,996
- Zach, he ain't here!
- Zach?

175
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:38,001
- No, honey, we're looking for Savino.
- Savino? No, he's my baby.

176
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,337
Yeah, well,
your baby shot a cop.

177
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,717
They're kicking in the doors,
looking for Savino.

178
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:49,221
- What up with that, man?
- Some shit about he killed a cop.

179
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,598
Who, Savino?
Savino ain't shot no cop.

180
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,850
They acting like he did it.

181
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,936
- Shit.
- I'm telling you, man.

182
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:01,567
- They're talking about it anyway.
- Ripples in the pond.

183
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,652
Talking ain't knowing, is it?

184
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,907
Skin this cat another way.

185
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,202
Two pages to Stringer
tonight, right?

186
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,663
Only this one
after the shooting.

187
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:19,876
Who's 07? And what phone is he asking
for Stringer to call him back?

188
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,346
- Shit went good but...
- Hold on.

189
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,641
The officer may have
been undercover.

190
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,481
- All right, talk.
- Like I said, it went good.

191
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:45,694
Except there was this bitch in the back seat.
Surprised the shit out of us.

192
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,614
Didn't even see her
until the shit popped off.

193
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,908
I mean if it was up to me,
I'd have let the girl walk.

194
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,952
She ain't look
like the talking type.

195
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:57,289
But Little Man seen her,
bugged out and let a couple go.

196
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,000
- Savino didn't tip y'all off?
- Wasn't no time.

197
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:04,254
He get up out the car, we see him go
up the block like we said, right?

198
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:07,049
After that, he out of sight and
we bring it home like we planned, baby.

199
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,968
Shorty was a cop.

200
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,890
And she ain't dead.

201
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,186
Where'd you all put the guns?

202
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,816
She wasn't no cop, man.
She look like one of Orlando's hos.

203
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,234
Bey, where the fuck are the guns?

204
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:32,616
- A storm drain off of Park Heights, man.
- What the fuck is wrong with Little Man?

205
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,951
This motherfucker bugged out
one time.

206
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,496
He gonna bug out again when
he find out shorty's a fucking cop?

207
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:42,084
Come on, man. Savino got a story
that he can keep to and he know it.

208
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:46,004
But Little Man,
he always been fucking weak like that.

209
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,756
Little Man gotta go.

210
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,717
You hear me?

211
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:57,933
This shit gonna get real heavy.
You understand me? We gotta fall back.

212
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:02,312
I wanna see how it go with this Savino
bullshit, see how they go past that.

213
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:06,483
But if the shit don't hold or if this
cop wake up and start talking shit,

214
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,735
then you gotta go sky up.

215
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,739
Where you got your peoples at?

216
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:18,036
New York, Jersey, Cleveland.

217
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:21,665
All right. So, Philly? DC?

218
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:26,253
You know what I'm saying?
No profile, no connections, no noise.

219
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:30,716
You feel me, right?
All right. We gotta be careful.

220
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,856
- Jesus.
- I'm sorry.

221
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,483
It's all right,
you just scared me.

222
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,236
I...

223
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,406
I work with Kima.

224
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,789
- Kima, she...
- Kima's at work.

225
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,170
What are you...?

226
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,394
Dust the receiver, the coin return
and the metal top.

227
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,196
The can too.

228
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,584
We can't really know for sure.

229
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,547
Lieutenant?

230
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,635
I'm sitting over there
with Kima's girl and...

231
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:02,057
Maybe somebody from the department
or the city might want to say something.

232
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,684
Who's here from the family?
A daughter, you say?

233
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:08,480
- A daughter?
- Officer Greggs has a girl?

234
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:12,776
A roommate.

235
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,113
The family's in Richmond,
driving up first thing.

236
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,241
The roommate's already here.

237
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,300
I'll do it myself.

238
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:44,140
No problem. If we lose her,
he can always pose for the funeral.

239
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:50,206
Still need the right door for Savino. His last
knowns, his girlfriend, his mama. Nothing.

240
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,209
Tracers picked up a of couple hairs
on one of the hoodies.

241
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,421
So either these guys
are neighborhood yos

242
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:00,425
who lucked into $30,000
on a street stick-up, or...

243
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:04,346
Or they're pros who set up in an alley
on one side of the tracks

244
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,098
then slip over to the other side,
where they park their ride.

245
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,267
What about the post?

246
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:12,145
Cause and manner of death
on Mr. Blocker is homicide,

247
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:17,067
to wit, close-range GSWs to the shoulder,
chest and left arm.

248
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,862
Nine millimeter, six left twist,
suitable for comparison.

249
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,782
We pulled something else
from the back seat of the car?

250
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,910
Yeah, .380, semi-jacketed.
Casings were different too.

251
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,870
So we confirmed the two shooters.

252
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:32,248
Print hit. Wynton Little Man Rice,
enforcer in the 221

253
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,210
and a definite connect to
Barksdale's world.

254
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,212
Print hit? Print hit from what?

255
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,716
Soda can. Dropped at the pay phone
at Park Heights and Belvedere.

256
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,219
Still had fizz in it
when I got there.

257
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,055
What is this pay phone
at Park Heights and Belvedere?

258
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:51,309
Some motherfucker paged Stringer Bell
20 minutes after the shooting.

259
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,561
I dusted the phone too,
but it was smudged.

260
00:21:54,230 --> 00:22:01,111
So we got a Barksdale pro in the northwest
ringing up the boss minutes after the deed.

261
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,279
So much for the amateur-hour theory.

262
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,281
Good pull. You are?

263
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,283
Freamon. Lester Freamon.

264
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:11,079
- Where you working?
- Pawnshop Unit.

265
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:20,338
How you gonna shoot a police? Ain't no
percentage in that, know what I'm saying?

266
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:21,965
For real.

267
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:26,636
Someone around here do that, every knocko
in the world be down here busting heads.

268
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:31,099
I guess them Park Heights niggers
just ain't got no fucking common sense.

269
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:36,354
- A lotta heart, just no sense.
- Poot. Wallace on the phone.

270
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:39,274
- Yeah?
- Wallace?

271
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,610
Nigger ring me up twice a day
whether he got shit to say or not.

272
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:46,990
- Homesick motherfucker making me bug.
- Where's he at?

273
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,534
At the shore with his grandma.

274
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,166
Surfing or some bullshit.
Or something.

275
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,081
- You just use that phone?
- Yeah, a little earlier.

276
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,833
- You might wanna go to Mosher Street.
- Just now?

277
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,668
Yeah.

278
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,590
- A man downtown needs to talk to you.
- Man downtown?

279
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,218
Make some sense
for this man, please.

280
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:51,179
- I ain't never been so clean in my life.
- I'm just doing my job.

281
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:02,440
- What up, Mr. Beachfront Property?
- No, fool, I told you, I'm bayside.

282
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:06,277
- My grandmother on the bayside.
- You on vacation and not bringing me.

283
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,656
- How you get all the way down there?
- I took a bus.

284
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,325
Shit, tell me how to go,
and I grab a 'hound too.

285
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,244
Come down and hang
with your ass.

286
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:18,164
No, man, it ain't like that. The air down here
all sticky. Worse than Baltimore.

287
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:22,418
And these crickets, louder than
a motherfucker. I can't get no sleep.

288
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,797
I ain't cut out to be
no country-ass nigger.

289
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,801
Please deposit two dollars
for an additional two minutes.

290
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,094
Shit, I gotta go.

291
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:34,305
You can take a nigger out the Westside
but you can't take...

292
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:04,419
What's your name?

293
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,922
Look, I didn't do shit here, OK?

294
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,428
- I asked you your name.
- No, this shit ain't right.

295
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,807
- Who'd you try to page, shit bird?
- Why the fuck do you care? I mean...

296
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:25,940
You have exactly three more seconds
to explain yourself to me, asshole.

297
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,738
One shooter opened
the passenger door,

298
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:35,450
so any latent prints
from that side...

299
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,952
- Why'd you page her, shit bird?
- Get off me.

300
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:41,956
- You think this is a game?
- I wanna talk to Greggs.

301
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:45,710
- You can't, motherfucker.
- Then McNulty then. This shit ain't right, sir.

302
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:55,803
Savino. Savino.

303
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:58,139
Mope ain't around.

304
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:09,525
One of them low-rise hoppers
on tower phone two.

305
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,902
OK.

306
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,831
Maybe he forgot the number.

307
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:40,515
- What the fuck was that?
- You don't know?

308
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:43,559
We just caught a re-up
off the tower stash.

309
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:46,187
Fourth floor, south side,
second unit down.

310
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,611
Put that away.

311
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,575
Put that away and work the case.

312
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:03,037
Can I ask you something?

313
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:14,924
How much of this case
would you give up to get her back?

314
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,386
- That's not the point.
- How much?

315
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,973
All of it.

316
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:26,060
But it doesn't work that way.
You can't give it back.

317
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:35,862
I'm sitting with a hospital progress report
that shows no fucking progress.

318
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:39,449
She's not conscious, she's intubated,
she's had a trach and a lung collapse.

319
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:43,995
And if she's got a shred of luck, the shot
she took to the neck didn't catch any spine.

320
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,084
It wasn't worth it.

321
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,341
Homicide for McNulty on line two.

322
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:08,603
Do your job.

323
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,743
- Yeah?
- So how you doing with it?

324
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,954
- I'll live.
- Yeah?

325
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:31,501
Well, listen, Jimmy.
We had a little dust-up over here.

326
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:36,964
Holley might have beat
one of your girl's CIs on spec.

327
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,134
What is he, a short guy?
Mumbles a lot?

328
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:46,182
That's him. You might wanna roll past and
squelch this shit before it gets outta hand.

329
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,434
Yeah.

330
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:58,653
- It ain't worth it, man.
- It ain't worth it at ten times the price.

331
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,321
A fucking cop, man!

332
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:04,575
How stupid is this motherfucker?
If you see a bitch in the car, change it up.

333
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,536
We can go to Orlando another day.

334
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,915
Savino was trying to signal, but he in the
dark, he don't know where Bey's coming from.

335
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,377
- Nothing breaking our way.
- We gotta burn this cop money.

336
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,421
It's probably marked somehow.

337
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:19,924
The guns are in the sewer,
Bey's a rock, but it's the bitch cop.

338
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,052
If she talks, she gonna put
Little Man and Bey in there.

339
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:26,889
- What up with Little Man?
- He's scared. He shot a cop.

340
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,184
- Fuck.
- But I put Bey on that.

341
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:34,480
- What about Savino?
- Savino, he gotta eat the charge.

342
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:38,776
But he knew that. So if he keep his
story tight, he gonna be all right.

343
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:41,571
We knew Orlando was
a snitching motherfucker.

344
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:43,906
But this is cash.
He got us caught up.

345
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:46,451
I know, man.
That's my fault, man.

346
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:51,581
Bey and Savino came to me with the idea that
if they take Orlando, they can take the cash.

347
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:53,875
I was like,
you all get your payday...

348
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:57,211
How the fuck is Orlando
gonna front this type of cash?

349
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:01,632
- What it say?
- I know, I fucked up.

350
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,889
All right, take this trash
outside, fucking burn it.

351
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,725
Tell Wee-Bey to clean up the mess
before he jet.

352
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:21,527
He was throwing 911 messages to
her pager. I asked him why.

353
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:24,864
He braced up.
Shit got outta hand.

354
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,511
Does he know?

355
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:37,043
McNulty, man. What they doing over there?
He just started beating on me.

356
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,378
Last night, she got shot.

357
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:44,300
- Where the fuck were you at?
- I was there.

358
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,804
Hey, Bunk.

359
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:52,642
We got no good latents
on the passenger side door.

360
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,812
What about the dash?

361
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,775
Call the lab.

362
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:06,405
What can I do?

363
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:10,952
For one thing you can roll around
the projects, see who's missing.

364
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,454
Who ain't around.

365
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,790
You OK with that?

366
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,918
Yeah, I just...

367
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,879
I been keeping it kinda close,
you know?

368
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:26,551
Ain't been around the projects much lately.
You know what I'm saying?

369
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,302
You beefing with someone down there?

370
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:32,139
No, I'm not beefing with...

371
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:41,232
Eyes open, Bubs.

372
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,901
For Kima.

373
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,487
Hang loose, I'll get you a ride.

374
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,618
Where are we with Savino?

375
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:55,329
- Still MIA.
- Enough of this bullshit.

376
00:31:57,249 --> 00:32:01,586
Well, if he calls me, I'll tell him
to turn himself in. I'm going to do that.

377
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,963
- Not good enough.
- Excuse me?

378
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,632
We need him now.

379
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:12,263
No, thanks. Perhaps as
an officer of the court...

380
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:16,434
Ronnie is being polite.
She's a member of your twisted little tribe.

381
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,269
She's putting it into
your twisted language.

382
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,688
Me? I wouldn't wipe my ass
with a Baltimore lawyer.

383
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,693
- No offense.
- None taken.

384
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:29,113
I'm willing to let you
ratfuckers suborn perjury

385
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,283
and blow smoke up a judge's ass
and jury-tamper your balls off

386
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,410
without losing the slightest bit
of my sunny disposition.

387
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:38,623
Fuck me if I don't let you structure
your cash into briefcase fees, either.

388
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,710
That's between you and the IRS.
Neither one of you is anyone's friend.

389
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,130
What Jimmy is trying to say is...

390
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,467
No, what Jimmy is saying is
if you want my nose closed to your shit,

391
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,594
you have to throw me something.

392
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,221
Right now I need Savino Bratton
in bracelets.

393
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,809
- I don't know where he is.
- You repped him the last four felonies.

394
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,728
I guess you can get word to him
if you want to.

395
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,193
A police may die, Maury,
and Savino was there.

396
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,781
He comes in this afternoon,
and he takes the drug charge at least.

397
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,741
Or what?

398
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:18,245
Or we send tactical teams
into his momma's house

399
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,081
until there's no house left
to worry about.

400
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,459
You get a letter from
the State's Attorney's office,

401
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,253
and subpoenas for
all your bank accounts.

402
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:29,965
And let's see if all those cash deposits
match the reported income.

403
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:38,724
I'm hearing this from him,
and I understand that he's distraught.

404
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:42,603
Am I hearing this from
the State's Attorney's office as well?

405
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,442
You are.

406
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:53,072
I'll see what I can do.

407
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:57,159
Fuck you, Jimmy!

408
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:00,329
- You didn't tell me that was coming.
- He'll bring him in.

409
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:03,290
- He will if he can, that's not the point.
- What's the point?

410
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:07,878
The point is that Maury Levy is a past
officer of the Monumental Bar Association,

411
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,464
and unless I want
to spend my whole life as an ASA,

412
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,925
I can't spend time
pissing on people who matter.

413
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,052
Another career in the balance.

414
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,850
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

415
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:24,770
If only half of you in the State's Attorney's
office didn't want to be judges,

416
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:27,064
didn't want to be partners
in a law firm,

417
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:30,109
if you had the balls to follow through,
you know what would happen?

418
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:33,529
A guy like that would be
tried and convicted.

419
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:37,283
The rest of them would back up
so we could push a clean case through.

420
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:40,202
But everybody stays friends.
Everybody gets paid.

421
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:41,787
And everybody's got
a fucking future.

422
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,167
You'll just use anyone, won't you?

423
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:59,764
I've been searching the logs for pager
hits that used an 07 code, right?

424
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:02,433
It comes up now and then
on D'Angelo's pager.

425
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,602
Stringer's too, but less often.

426
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,979
Most of the time,
there's nothing to place the guy.

427
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,482
But check it.

428
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:14,111
- And this is on Stringer's page?
- It comes back to the pay phone

429
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,238
at Maryland General Hospital.

430
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:21,202
Let me guess. The date of this page
is the same day that Stinkum got killed.

431
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:26,081
- And Wee-Bey got shot in the leg.
- That was the talk on the wire anyway.

432
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:31,420
If you pull the ER records for that morning,
you're gonna find Wee-Bey in the pile.

433
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,715
07 is Wee-Bey. It's gotta be.

434
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,471
Then we have Wee-Bey and Little Man
at the pay phone at Park Heights

435
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,598
20 minutes after the ambush,

436
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,683
throwing a page to Stringer.

437
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:49,063
We're all over town
for this piece-of-shit Savino.

438
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,023
With ties to the Barksdale
organization?

439
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,609
- Yes, sir.
- What else?

440
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:59,114
The case is progressing. We're gleaning
possible shooters from the wiretap.

441
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,367
I asked for the controlled buy.

442
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,661
I put one of our people
in harm's way.

443
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:07,665
So right now I want to make sure
that we are doing everything.

444
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,667
- We are, sir, we're on it.
- Good.

445
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:13,337
The commissioner wants raids citywide.
Every door we can take.

446
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:17,258
Any addresses we can write on,
anything connected to a narcotics case.

447
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:20,177
CID, tactical, the DEUs.

448
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:25,558
And tomorrow, on the six o'clock news,
we put a lot of fucking dope on the table.

449
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,601
A lot of it.

450
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,020
Dope on the table?

451
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,398
We need to let them know
who we are.

452
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:36,193
We can't for one minute
let them think that this will stand.

453
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:40,781
The Commissioner wants
to send a message, Lieutenant.

454
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:46,287
You make sure you and your people do
everything possible to see that it is heard.

455
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,506
Dope on the damn table.

456
00:36:57,591 --> 00:37:01,635
Hey, it's like the man said.
We're letting them know who we are.

457
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,763
Yeah?
And who the hell are we?

458
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:16,984
Again, for the record, let's make clear
that Mr. Bratton has not been Mirandized

459
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:20,195
and that what is said here
is for purposes of a proffer.

460
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,573
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

461
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,701
OK, then. Here you go.

462
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:37,922
That's baking soda. Which Mr. Bratton
intended to sell to Orlando Blocker.

463
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,381
You can keep it with our compliments.

464
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,510
- Where's the money?
- Mr. Bratton did not receive money.

465
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,306
He left it in the car when he went
to retrieve the sham cocaine.

466
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,517
If you recorded the transaction,
the tape will confirm this.

467
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:54,855
And he wasn't around for the shooting.
He doesn't know who the shooters are.

468
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:58,692
And God knows he wasn't in on the setup.
I mean, it was pure dumb luck

469
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:02,404
that he left them in an dead-end alley
and they were shot just two minutes later.

470
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,783
This is bullshit.
A police is down.

471
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:11,747
Mr. Bratton had no knowledge
that the young woman was a police officer

472
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:17,378
and no intention of doing anything other
than defrauding Mr. Blocker of $30,000.

473
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,547
Ms. Nathan?

474
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:24,927
No charge if he gives us
the shooters.

475
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:29,640
And if he testifies, we'll find a way to squeeze
him into the federal witness program.

476
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:36,230
As I indicated, Mr. Bratton has no idea who
shot Mr. Blocker or the undercover officer.

477
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,985
Best you can do is 286B.

478
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,739
- What the hell is that?
- Distribution of sham CDS.

479
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:49,827
- Three-year maximum, $5,000 fine.
- That's it?

480
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:53,497
If he took the cash,
we could go to felony theft or fraud,

481
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,041
but the tape has him
leaving the money.

482
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:01,296
- Three years.
- A cop was shot, Maury.

483
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:03,590
So if we convict,
he'll do every damn day of the three.

484
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:06,635
I can do the three.
Ain't no thing.

485
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:11,682
And the $5,000 fine?
Oh, shit, you still up $25,000, right?

486
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:22,818
Nicely done.

487
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:29,658
Give me two.

488
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:08,697
Damn, Orlando.
I still can't believe that shit.

489
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:13,744
Man, all this shit behind this motherfucker.
Who the fuck was he?

490
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,662
He ran a club for my uncle.

491
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:16,747
Yeah?

492
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,166
First Stink, and now him.

493
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:23,045
And I heard the cops
been all in Savino's shit too.

494
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,214
- He ain't been around.
- Little Man neither.

495
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:28,425
Somebody could clean up shit
around here.

496
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:32,638
True. You can't just be going around
dropping Five-0 like that.

497
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:35,224
You know how your uncle is
when people get to fucking up.

498
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,851
He starts taking that shit
personal, man.

499
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,646
Look like a couple more niggers
gonna get dropped.

500
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:43,357
- What up?
- You D?

501
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:44,483
Yeah.

502
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,111
You need to get with Stringer
right away.

503
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:52,908
See?
You moving up in the world.

504
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,203
As long as you don't fall in
with the trash they taking out.

505
00:40:57,205 --> 00:41:00,374
Yeah, whatever, nigger.
I'll be right back.

506
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:05,629
Tower boys all nervous and shit.
Little Man ain't post for work.

507
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,840
Ain't answering his page neither.

508
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:10,175
See?

509
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:15,556
I'm not gonna lie.
She has swelling around the vertebrae,

510
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,392
and some indications of
partial paralysis.

511
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:22,104
That may or may not go away
when the swelling goes down.

512
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,732
- Her family is with her.
- What the fuck is up with Homicide?

513
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:29,570
- Are we on the shooters yet?
- They're working it hard.

514
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:35,325
The departmental response is gonna be
to take doors tomorrow morning. Citywide.

515
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:39,621
Every unit is kicking in any
drug-connected address they can write on.

516
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,374
- We're gonna do the same.
- Lieutenant, is that...

517
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,794
Except we're gonna hold back
on the main stash.

518
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,422
The house up in northwest
we tracked...

519
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,425
We advance this case more
by sitting there.

520
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:56,096
And raids that are too much on the bull's-eye
will have Barksdale changing up.

521
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,515
We might blow the wire altogether.

522
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:02,519
Two addresses in the low-rises
are probables

523
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:06,607
and another two row houses have been used
for stash as recently as last week.

524
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:11,612
But this... this here is the best bet
for a good rip.

525
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:14,907
Herc picked up on it yesterday.

526
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:19,536
Fourth-floor, end unit
on the south side of the 221.

527
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:23,081
They're dropping the re-ups out
the window to the hoppers.

528
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:26,460
- What if they change up the apartment?
- They do that every day.

529
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:31,381
- Yesterday was the fifth floor, north side.
- We'll have a man there with a cell phone.

530
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:35,802
They change up, we call the duty judge,
who orally amends the warrant.

531
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,597
We hit everything at 11:00.

532
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:42,059
The squad that takes the high-rise
needs to stage at 05:00.

533
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:44,978
We need to be inside
before the building even wakes up.

534
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:49,733
Anyone who wants to sleep tonight
needs to start typing his ass off right now.

535
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:56,698
What's up?
Why ain't the club open?

536
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,284
You going with Bey.

537
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,662
Yo, Bey.

538
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:05,540
Keep it clean.
Don't make no mistakes.

539
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:17,594
Going where?

540
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,639
What the fuck you waiting for?

541
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:48,208
Stop bullshitting me!

542
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:09,646
The main stash. He knows we're on it.
He knows we held it back.

543
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,357
The Deputy.

544
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,485
We grab a senator's bag man
in the projects, he knows that.

545
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,696
State Police come in,
he knows that too.

546
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,407
- Like fucking clockwork.
- He's got a rat.

547
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,868
Here, in the detail.

548
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:31,418
In the beginning,
when we started, Burrell had me.

549
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:34,755
I pipelined everything
to that motherfucker.

550
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,549
- But now...
- He lost you.

551
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:40,177
So now he's picked up
someone else.

552
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,262
That's how they do.

553
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:11,500
Can we talk?

554
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,252
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.

555
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,965
It's Burrell,
he's gotta back off already.

556
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:23,136
- What now?
- We're on a prime location. Barksdale's stash.

557
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:26,515
He wants us to write a paper
and take the door.

558
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:28,725
- Why?
- Dope on the table.

559
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:31,686
It's a photo op to make us feel better
about Greggs getting shot.

560
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:36,108
- Christ.
- You need to rip him a new one, Your Honor.

561
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,278
I don't know, Jimmy.

562
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,242
You back on the ticket, huh?

563
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,746
It was just the usual bullshit.

564
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,335
They're just dicking me around,

565
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:59,756
trying to get another black face, make it
four-and-one to even up for the last time.

566
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:02,300
The Governor promised
two new appointments.

567
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:05,345
So now we're back where we were.
That's all it was.

568
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,515
That's all?

569
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:11,726
Half-assed hack politics, Jimmy.

570
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,354
It has nothing to do
with your case.

571
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:17,983
I need you on this.

572
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,535
So, who's my daddy now?

573
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:41,214
I just do what the fuck
they tell me, you know?

574
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:46,052
It ain't on me to know
what the fuck they have in mind.

575
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:49,431
- Look, Bey.
- Now it come down to this crazy shit.

576
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:54,686
Yo, turn in this alley right here.
Right there.

577
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,444
<i>What's the sound?
Out of bounds...</i>

578
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,864
<i>Another nigger down and out,
a crackhead with no name...</i>

579
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,575
What the fuck you stopping for?
Go!

580
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,120
<i>Some guy hit hard
and wound up paying</i>

581
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:14,915
<i>Out in the field
where the bands keep playing</i>

582
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,833
<i>Understand what I'm saying...</i>

583
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:34,226
Inside, man. Let's go.

584
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,688
This dude is crazy.

585
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:46,279
Get in, motherfucker.
We ain't got all night for this shit.

586
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,839
Man, get in here.

587
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:18,520
Go ahead, man.
What's wrong with you?

588
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,910
Check it out, D.

589
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:40,208
I need you to feed them
while I'm gone.

590
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:45,338
You gonna give them different food
for each tank too, all right?

591
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:50,510
But don't worry.
I'm gonna show you what to do. Come here.

592
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:55,432
These are my Tetras.

593
00:48:56,809 --> 00:49:01,521
You got Kimmy, Alex, Aubrey
and Jezebel in here somewhere.

594
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:03,940
I don't know,
she think she cute.

595
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:07,777
You take two pinches of whatever food
I got next to each tank.

596
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:09,863
They set for the day.

597
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:14,951
You see, they ain't no problems.
Just beautiful as hell, D.

598
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:17,704
I'm gonna go upstairs
and pack some shit.

599
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:23,501
Yo, Bey.
Where we going, man?

600
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:25,879
Philly.
You gonna take the truck back,

601
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:29,799
but first I got to grab some shit,
show you what to do with my tanks, right?

602
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,885
Philly?

603
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,929
We shot a narco, D.

604
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:46,900
<i>I've been told</i>

605
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,446
<i>Soothe me</i>

606
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:56,451
<i>I want some sugar
in my bowl</i>

607
00:49:57,787 --> 00:50:04,292
<i>I want some steam
on my clothes</i>

608
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:09,255
<i>Maybe I can fix things up
so they'll go</i>

609
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,802
<i>What's the matter, Daddy?</i>

610
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:17,597
<i>Come on, save my soul</i>

611
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:22,435
<i>I want some sugar in my bowl</i>

612
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,020
<i>I ain't foolin'...</i>

613
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:28,942
No Savino.
No Little Man, no Wee-Bey either.

614
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:34,989
And the Barksdale kid from the Pit.
He's out the mix too.

615
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:37,617
You think it was them that did it?

616
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:43,289
- Wee-Bey, Savino, Little Man.
- Yeah, that's what we're hearing too.

617
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:47,335
We got pick-ups on these motherfuckers
and miles of NCIC bullshit.

618
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:51,631
- Warrants for blood and hair too.
- It's Bey and Little Man, shooter one and two.

619
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:54,467
Yeah?

620
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:58,304
Well, right now
we need our girl to wake up and say so.

621
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:00,724
All right.

622
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:03,643
You did good, Bubs.

623
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:07,689
McNulty, you know,
the situation is different for me.

624
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:10,775
- I mean, for me, I'm...
- Mount up.

625
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,782
I gotta go.

626
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:19,868
Prez will get you a ride, OK?

627
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:40,263
Move out.

628
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:02,494
Police.

629
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:04,621
Police! Go!

630
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:09,834
Show your hands, asshole!
Down on the ground. Move it!

631
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,796
Check the basement.

632
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,298
- Clear?
- All clear.

633
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,717
- Bathroom's clear.
- Check the mattress.

634
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:20,512
Check under the bed, check all the drawers,
every inch of this room.

635
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:29,479
- Got anything?
- No.

636
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:30,897
Bingo.

637
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:39,239
- Got it.
- There she goes.

638
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:40,865
Bag it.

639
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:49,916
Let's do it.

640
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:29,998
That's fine police work, Erv.

641
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:35,211
Ladies and gentlemen,

642
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:37,171
what you see on the table
in front of you

643
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:41,634
represents our department's answer
to a culture of death and drugs.

644
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,470
And when an officer falls
in this war,

645
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:47,015
others stand ready to pick up
the challenge

646
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:50,935
and carry the fight to the very
doorstep of those responsible.

647
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,563
This is only the beginning,
I can assure you.

648
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:58,151
But today,
a message has been sent.

649
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,696
And believe me, this message
is being heard loud and clear

650
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:05,158
by all those who seek
profit and power...

651
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,660
in the importation and sale
of illegal drugs.

652
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:09,662
Slow.

653
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:13,583
Bullshit on the McCullough Street phone,
nothing on the towers.

654
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,252
- Who's on the rooftop?
- No one.

655
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:20,882
Fuck it.

656
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:23,885
Where's the money, man?

657
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,554

- Your grandma ain't got it?
- She gonna try to stop me from booking.

659
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:34,354
I'm telling you, boy.
This country-ass shit got me all messed up.

660
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:38,566
You need to send me something
for the bus. I'm dying.

661
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:42,153
I feel you.
When do you want to come home?

662
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:45,531
