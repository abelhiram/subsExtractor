1
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:12,261
We gonna play the brand-new
big, bad game. Call us now...

2
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,893
Hello? Hello?

3
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,232
Who was that?

4
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,860
- They hung up without saying.
- They hung up without saying?

5
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,286
What you care? You never use
the damn phone in here no how.

6
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,193
<i>Na-na-na</i>

7
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:14,532
<i>And we say,
na-na na na-nah...</i>

8
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:25,376
<i>Politicians got lipstick
on the collar...</i>

9
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:26,794
What's up, baby?

10
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,380
I need you to get them
phone lines up out that house.

11
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:31,507
Out of the apartment?
Why?

12
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:35,178
What Chansay gonna say about
not having a line in her own place?

13
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,182
All right. Got you.

14
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:44,312
- What's up, baby, you got a problem? Good.
- I'm just sayin'.

15
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:47,732
It seem we goin' past careful
with all of this, man.

16
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:51,027
Like we buggin' out or something.
You know, like we paranoid and shit.

17
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,829
No, not this phone.
We used this phone yesterday.

18
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:06,083
What you blowing out
your mouth for?

19
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,670
Ain't nobody out to get me?
I got no enemies?

20
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,839
No, man.

21
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,717
We all right.

22
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,853
<i>If you walk through the garden</i>

23
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,731
<i>You better watch your back</i>

24
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,653
<i>Well, I beg your pardon</i>

25
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,531
<i>Walk the straight
and narrow track</i>

26
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,409
<i>If you walk with Jesus</i>

27
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:44,163
<i>He'll save your soul</i>

28
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,334
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

29
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,045
<i>Down in the hole</i>

30
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,633
<i>All the angels sing</i>

31
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,303
<i>About Jesus' mighty sword</i>

32
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,057
<i>And they shield you
with their wings</i>

33
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:07,812
<i>Keep you close to the Lord</i>

34
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,773
<i>Don't pay heed to temptation</i>

35
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:15,611
<i>For his hands are so cold</i>

36
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,823
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

37
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:22,618
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

38
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,337
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

39
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,966
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

40
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,721
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

41
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,807
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

42
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,734
This gonna be so easy.

43
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,570
Eastside chumps,
ain't nothing like Avon's people.

44
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,071
Watch. Y'all gonna see.

45
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,909
All right.
Y'all gonna be here, right?

46
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,662
Hold up. Hold up.
Yo, Boo!

47
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:11,834
I'm gonna slide up through here.
Bailey, you gonna cover the alley.

48
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,920
Yo!

49
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:22,345
Yo, Maurice short, man.

50
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,013
- How short?
- Three.

51
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,474
Tell him to grow
a couple of inches.

52
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,522
Where you gonna be at?

53
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,610
That be the trap right there.

54
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:41,072
You figure they roll
through the alley?

55
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,700
Rats run to holes
in times of danger.

56
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,786
And you him, ain't you?

57
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,747
- Who?
- Danger.

58
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,291
No, man. I'm just a nigger
with a plan, that all.

59
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:55,544
- And a shotgun.
- For sure.

60
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,007
Sorry I'm late.

61
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,593
Got myself lost down
the other hallway.

62
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:07,223
- That leads to the loading dock.
- Yeah, and deep storage.

63
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,769
So this is where they put you?
Quite a message they're sending.

64
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,730
- And that message is...
- Out of sight, out of mind.

65
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,316
Spoken like a true troglodyte.

66
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,863
Whole lot of dead trees
behind this nonsense.

67
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,490
The foundation of your case.

68
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:29,078
You lay it in right, you can build on it.
You lay it in wrong, everything on top falls.

69
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,004
We ready?

70
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,627
Do you swear and affirm that the affidavit
is true to the best of your knowledge?

71
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,004
I do.

72
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,090
Then by the power vested in me,
I now declare you man and wife.

73
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,469
- Did he swear already?
- The state's attorney?

74
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,430
Yeah. I see it.

75
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,225
Second copy is sealed for the court
and the police get the others.

76
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,518
How's this work?

77
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,272
Same frequency as the one
carried by D'Angelo Barksdale.

78
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,774
He gets a page, we get a page.

79
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:03,279
- So, we up now?
- It's official. You're up.

80
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,449
Then let the game begin.

81
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:15,124
Celebrities always seem smaller
when you meet them in person.

82
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,468
Yo! Yo!

83
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,261
Hey, yo!

84
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,348
Check it out, here he come.

85
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,686
- Somethin' ain't right, yo.
- Watch out, man, he got that boom.

86
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,147
- He's packing.
- Here he come.

87
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,567
Yo, come on,
Omar's coming, man!

88
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,445
Shit!

89
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:07,426
Yeah.

90
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,929
The cheese stands alone.

91
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,601
- How you know?
- 'Cause if you could, I'd have been had.

92
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:20,481
Yo, he saying you can't catch the bug
just by getting your dick sucked.

93
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:24,110
Dumb-ass. You gotta be
in some pussy to get it, all right?

94
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,239
Man, wear a coat if you want,
don't nobody like suckin' on a rubber.

95
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,825
How would you know?

96
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,164
Who you trying to fuck anyway?

97
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,918
Arletta Mouzone.
Treenee's cousin.

98
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:45,589
Damn, man. In that case
use a big-ass condom, all right?

99
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,842
You need a trash bag.
Fuck that.

100
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:52,805
I wouldn't run up in that bitch
with D'Angelo's dick. It's triflin'.

101
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,410
Easy to see why niggers come
around here stealing our shit!

102
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,080
Yo, you know what, nigger?

103
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,876
What?

104
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,382
Forget it.

105
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,805
142 isn't a working
telephone exchange.

106
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,517
Six intercepts so far,
and five aren't working numbers?

107
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:40,853
Something wrong with
the recorder?

108
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,481
We're getting what you'd expect,
seven digits of a number

109
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:47,902
and a two-digit add-on to
identify the caller, like here, 13.

110
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:51,030
McNulty, line one.

111
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,450
- Yeah.
- Did you just get a 142 exchange?

112
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,993
Yeah.
That's what we got too.

113
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,454
- That's fucked up.
- All right, later.

114
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,376
He's got the same numbers
on the readout of the cloned pagers.

115
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,669
So it's not the recorder.

116
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,671
They're using a code
to cover their calls?

117
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,966
- That's pretty damn sophisticated.
- What is?

118
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:16,055
They've coded numbers
in their pager messages.

119
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,306
How do you know?

120
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:21,644
Every time the Barksdale kid's pager goes off,
this machine gives a message and time.

121
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,396
McNulty has a cloned pager
but we use this in court.

122
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,065
Same with those pen registers.

123
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,276
Every time a pay phone
in the low-rise court is used,

124
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,821
we get the telephone number,
the time and the duration of the call.

125
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:37,660
- Incoming calls too.
- Spy shit. Very cool.

126
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,162
You say they're using
some kind of code?

127
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,123
They got to be. These numbers
don't make no fuckin' sense.

128
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,174
- You rang?
- Omar's ride. Bubbles spotted it.

129
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,345
Different tags, no stolen report,
these come back right for the van

130
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,514
but Bubs makes it
by the cargo rack.

131
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:02,268
Good scope.
You wanna take him?

132
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:06,480
Can't hurt to try. We pop Omar, get a gun,
he might let us work him.

133
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,275
Anything coming through
on the pager?

134
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:15,531
Eight hits so far,
most of them in some kind of code.

135
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,035
These ain't Baltimore exchanges,
that's for sure.

136
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:24,206
Three weeks to get Daniels to agree, a week
to write the affidavit and then this bullshit.

137
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,794
How complex a code can it be
if these knuckleheads are using it?

138
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,673
Then again, what does it say
about us if we can't break it?

139
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,386
You wanna run Bubs back downtown,
I'll sit here and wait for you.

140
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,263
All right.

141
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,853
- What'd I miss, girlfriend?
- Not a goddamn thing.

142
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,897
Boring, ain't we?

143
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,609
How y'all do what you do every day
and not wanna get high?

144
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,069
That's what I be asking.

145
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,246
It's been a little hectic
down here, right, cuz?

146
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,416
String, man, I can't lie.

147
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,461
Them stick-up boys,
they caught us dead up.

148
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,465
And the Narcos, shit,
I don't know what the fuck that was.

149
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,383
Five-0. Comin' up!

150
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,303
- Five-0 comin' up, y'all.
- Time out.

151
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,431
- What is that?
- What?

152
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:28,145
Get your crew to understand it's the stick-up
crews and creepers that give us trouble.

153
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,982
When they start thinking like that,
you're not gonna have any more surprises.

154
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:38,155
'Cause you know, your uncle and me,
we think you got a snitch up in the shop.

155
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,658
- What?
- Someone who tips off the stick-up crew.

156
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:46,789
And you gotta be on that, right?
You gotta be on that.

157
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,749
I'm gonna tell you what you do.

158
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,335
What day is it today, Friday?

159
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,212
What happen on Friday?

160
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,714
- Payday.
- Not this Friday.

161
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,424
Why not?

162
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:01,553
You gonna call 'em like you gonna pay 'em
and then you crack 'em.

163
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:05,391
You tell 'em you're not happy with
what they fuckin' pass as work down here.

164
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,560
When you're not happy,
they ain't gettin' paid. Feel me?

165
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,605
But you don't pay a nigger,
he ain't gonna work for you.

166
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,775
You think a nigger's
gonna get a job?

167
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:19,863
These niggers gonna be like, fuck it,
let me quit this game here and go to college?

168
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,492
They gonna buck a little,
but they not gonna walk.

169
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,287
- And in the end, you gonna get respect.
- Yeah.

170
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:31,625
And when that money run out,
they'll come up to you and roll on you

171
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:36,672
and ask you for an advance and shit,
when they flat-ass broke.

172
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,675
Them the niggers that
you strike off your list.

173
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:45,848
But that nigger that stay eatin', the nigger
that steady rollin', ain't askin' you for shit,

174
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,352
that's the nigger I want
to hear about. Understand?

175
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,275
Yeah, man. Shit, you know
how to play a nigger into a corner, String.

176
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,279
- Take care of this right here.
- You my favorite girl.

177
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,865
Shit, let me handle this, man.

178
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,368
Hey, Poot.

179
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,413
- Come here, man.
- What's happening?

180
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:13,584
What the fuck is that? What the fuck is that?!
You know the fuckin' rules.

181
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:41,778
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Copying.

182
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,991
A telephone.

183
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,911
This fucking detail...

184
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,506
It's after three.

185
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,091
So where are the boys at?

186
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,843
Maybe they only come out
at night.

187
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,140
I used to have a guy like Omar
working for me.

188
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,018
Guy named Reuben Terry.

189
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,772
- Is he good?
- Saw the street like we wish we could.

190
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,275
Ain't nothing like a good CI.

191
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,989
School's out.

192
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,076
Can I use your cellphone?

193
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,677
I got that. I did.

194
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,684
- I know.
- I don't know about this.

195
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,686
What do you mean,
you don't know?

196
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:59,565
For Christ's sakes, I'm their father.
You think I'd let 'em sleep on the floor?

197
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,651
Yes, I got them.

198
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:07,489
Sheets, pillows, comforters, pillowcases.
I fuckin' got them.

199
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,615
What color are they?

200
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,493
What the fuck do you care
what color? Hello?

201
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,294
- Lost her.
- I bet.

202
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,296
You know something?

203
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:26,508
My ex-wife, the way she acts sometimes,
the way she deals with shit...

204
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:33,515
You would think a less enlightened man
than myself, cruder man than myself,

205
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:37,227
a man less sensitized to the qualities
and charms and value of women,

206
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,022
not me, but a man like that,
he just might call her a cunt.

207
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,568
You just called the mother
of your children a cunt.

208
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,028
No, I did not.

209
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,404
- Yes, you fuckin' did.
- No, I did not.

210
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,157
Let's just leave this, OK?
I got some stuff to do.

211
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,081
Five-0, gotta go.
Man, get out the way!

212
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:07,633
Shit.

213
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,510
Not much fighting this time.
Getting tired, asshole?

214
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,471
Still dragging from Kima's
whupping.

215
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,222
Fucked you up
like a cop should.

216
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,225
That's one thing about Kima,
she put a hurtin' on you like a man.

217
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,229
Get your monkey ass up.

218
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,442
You're gonna want
your business card back, right?

219
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,570
Come on.

220
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,829
<i>From Bantry Bay
to the Derry Quay</i>

221
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:41,500
<i>And from Galway
to Dublin Town</i>

222
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:47,089
<i>Well, I never seen
my brown colleen</i>

223
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:50,217
<i>That I met in
the County Down</i>

224
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,555
<i>That I met in
the County Down</i>

225
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,982
<i>That I met in
the County Down</i>

226
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,485
First, I go in, play nice.

227
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,905
- Then you come in, play bad.
- I ain't playin'.

228
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,296
Bracelet too tight?

229
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,940
You rackin' up all
kinds of points, ain't you?

230
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:51,445
First, you put a cop in the hospital,
damn near kill his ass with that punch.

231
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:54,239
Now, you on the wing
from Boy's Village.

232
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:58,660
Man, I'm 16, all right?
What the fuck they gonna do to me?

233
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,580
That's the least of your worries,
my friend.

234
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,542
I got a partner outside who can't wait
to get in here and fuck you up.

235
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,503
Cop you banged was Herc's uncle.

236
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,757
Herc wants off the leash
on this one.

237
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:16,845
And I suppose you
at the other end of that leash?

238
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,729
See, I don't want to play
it that way.

239
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,150
I know about comin' up
hard and all.

240
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:34,488
Why, you... you came up hard?

241
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,949
Flag House projects.
Eastside.

242
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,204
Yeah, Flag House?

243
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,293
You know, you remind me of me.

244
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:55,759
I'm thinking we should work
something out.

245
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,597
What do I get?

246
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,605
What you want?

247
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,697
I... I want...

248
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,243
for you to suck my dick.

249
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:32,170
- I'll beat your fuckin' ass.
- Take it easy.

250
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,632
- You're supposed to be the good cop!
- Dumb motherfucker!

251
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,218
What? What?

252
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,814
- Hello, may I help you?
- We'd like a table.

253
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,357
And you have reservations?

254
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,778
I thought, you know,
we could just walk in...

255
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,947
Let me see what I got.

256
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,409
That's two?

257
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,123
Follow me, please.

258
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,302
Your coat, ma'am?

259
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,015
- Can we get that one, over there?
- It's Friday night.

260
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,309
Those are for reservations.

261
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:29,352
Let me get your chair
for you, ma'am.

262
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:34,816
- It's OK, man, all right.
- Here you are.

263
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,654
Here you are, sir.

264
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,365
Your waiter will be
with you shortly.

265
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,705
You shoulda pushed him, D.

266
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,354
Oh, bastards.

267
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:34,250
Sarge, nobody answers at Juvenile
Intake and we been calling.

268
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,712
Clearly, they're not
as dedicated as you two detectives.

269
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:40,382
What time does the duty
consultant get here?

270
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,677
You missed the 8:00.
You got another one around midnight.

271
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:49,140
- Midnight?
- You think if we left you the paperwork,

272
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,017
you could put him
in the box until Intake gets here?

273
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,574
Hemorrhoid.

274
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,216
For the crumbs.

275
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:24,759
Yeah, right.

276
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,599
- You like your dinner?
- Yeah.

277
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:34,728
- That shrimp was right.
- Yeah, it was good, right?

278
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,111
Think they know?

279
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:45,447
Do they know what?

280
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,866
You know. What I'm about.

281
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,786
What you mean, D?

282
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:55,081
Come on. You know.
It's like...

283
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,500
We get all dressed up, right?

284
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:01,379
Come all the way across town.
Fancy place like this.

285
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:06,426
Then we go down to the harbor, walk around
a bit, act like we belong down here.

286
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:10,972
So?
Your money good, right?

287
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,892
D, we ain't the only
black people in here.

288
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:20,356
It ain't what I'm talking about.
It's about where we... Come on, you know.

289
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:25,153
I'm just saying, you know, I feel
like some shit just stays with you.

290
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,782
You know what I'm saying,
like, hard as you try,

291
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,700
you still can't go nowhere.

292
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:34,788
- Can I interest you in dessert?
- Yes, thank you.

293
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,749
- Can I have some chocolate cake?
- I'll bring the cart.

294
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,799
Boy, don't nobody give a damn
about you or your story.

295
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:49,219
You got money, you get to be
whatever you say you are.

296
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:50,428
That's the way it is.

297
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:58,353
Sir, I'm sorry.
These are the samples.

298
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,779
And for you, sir?
Very good.

299
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:17,914
Don't be a bitch.
Admit it.

300
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,836
Go ahead.

301
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:28,383
- Admit you're wrong. Be a man.
- I gotta confess.

302
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,886
This sub beats chink-ass
Bob's by a mile.

303
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,890
You might be all that when
it comes to thumpin' on niggers

304
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,226
but you can't do shit
with that stick.

305
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:41,187
- You'd do better.
- I play.

306
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,565
Says he plays.

307
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,611
- He might.
- I'm even better with two hands.

308
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:53,158
I checked it out, man.
Stinkum true on this one.

309
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,244
Except for that nigger, Scar,
from New York.

310
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:59,998
- Edmondson gully is wide open.
- What about Tee-Tee's crew?

311
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:04,502
They dried up when they took that federal
charge. Most of 'em are gettin' high.

312
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:09,883
I'll tell you what.
You holler at the boy Scar.

313
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,926
Let him know it's time
for him to take a stroll.

314
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:15,513
If he give you any beef at all,
we'll put Wee-Bey and Bird on it.

315
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,432
Then once we got him out,

316
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:21,144
we'll send in the smokers to run out
all the little poop-butt locals and shit.

317
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,440
If some cats got game,
we put 'em on our team.

318
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,192
Who do you want to run it?

319
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,611
- Send Stinkum up here.
- All right.

320
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:32,614
He saw the shot.
So, he gets a shot.

321
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,999
OK.

322
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,293
Not bad.

323
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:47,337
Can't let the duty officer
see that.

324
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,465
You wanna give it a rest, man?
You down 60.

325
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,135
That might be your salary
but I clock that in minutes.

326
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:57,513
- Rack 'em and break 'em.
- You waiting for Juvenile Intake?

327
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,682
He's in the squad room.

328
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,478
If I had more time,
I'd run you.

329
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,024
Give you a tip, Preston.

330
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:11,402
You gonna run a hustle,
you best stay with what you know.

331
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:15,949
Man, fuck you and
your tired-ass advice, all right?

332
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,538
But that sandwich was good.

333
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,884
You gonna move our little thing
down to Edmondson Avenue.

334
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:37,345
Take the gully.

335
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:41,182
What about Scar?

336
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,560
Who?

337
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:48,481
Listen, I'm giving you points
on the package,

338
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,776
so you make a go of it,
you hear me?

339
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:56,030
You working for yourself too,
so you gonna put out the strong product

340
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,865
and get the locals behind it.

341
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,577
It's as simple as that.
You get your team together, you feel me?

342
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,039
Go and wait for me downstairs.
I'll be down in a minute, man.

343
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:09,544
- We gonna make this money run in a few.
- Smile or something, nigger.

344
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,383
- Made that nigger's night.
- He deserved it though.

345
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:22,140
It's Wee-Bey. We got one.

346
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,809
- You think it's Omar?
- Nah.

347
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:29,063
- It's one of the young 'uns, I think.
- One down, two to go, right?

348
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:32,775
Motherfuckers.
Trying to rob me, baby.

349
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,160
One, two, three.

350
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:55,733
- A winner.
- A match? Which case?

351
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:58,903
The one you brought me.
Casing in that girl shot up in Northeast.

352
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:01,489
- Kresson?
- Right, yeah.

353
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,783
She matches up with two other cases
from last year.

354
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:07,161
- Which ones?
- Toreen Boyle.

355
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,499
- Ligget. It's in the report.
- It's Toreen Boyd, Roland Leggett.

356
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:17,213
Yeah, them. Casings from all three killings
go to a .45, probably Colt Classic.

357
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:21,717
- That fucker Landsman. How's he do it?
- You like Landsman for these three?

358
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:27,348
I don't know. As sergeants go, Jay's a
sociopath, but I'd go with an actual gangster.

359
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,353
Jimmy, you sitting down?

360
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:35,314
I said it was hot, but if you
got these barbecue gloves...

361
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,108
You got a Johnny Weeks up in here?

362
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,734
- Who?
- Johnny Weeks.

363
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,320
- Over in the game room.
- Obliged.

364
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,990
- Any smokes?
- I'm out.

365
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:48,744
You gotta give the medication a chance
to work in your system, man.

366
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,789
Isn't that great?

367
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,426
Brought you something.

368
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:07,054
Some chicken pieces
and some fries.

369
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,725
I bought a shake,
but I dropped it on the bus.

370
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,148
It comes in a bag,
goes out in a bag.

371
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,947
How long you have that for?

372
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:32,079
- I fucked up, man.
- Yeah, I saw.

373
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,291
There was nothing I could do,
you know?

374
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:40,213
It's like first I got beat,
right, then I get this.

375
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,510
What are these for?

376
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,765
They say I got the bug.

377
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,104
The bug?

378
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,899
- They checked me when I was in hospital.
- Are they sure?

379
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,869
Where you been at?

380
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,540
Here and there, I'm at it.

381
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:18,417
I'd have come past sooner,
but I been on a mission.

382
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:21,087
- A mission?
- Them hoppers that beat you down,

383
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:22,922
they got problems now.

384
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,341
- Them and the people they sling for, even.
- What?

385
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,053
I put the police on their ass.

386
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,516
Police? What, you get locked up
or something?

387
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:37,353
I'm not working for them.
I'm working with them.

388
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,647
They don't give me the badge soon enough,
I keep doing like I do.

389
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,650
Why?

390
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:48,781
What do you mean why?
How can you ask me why?

391
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,492
Why the fuck are you in here,
with all these falling-down motherfuckers?

392
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:57,290
Why you passing shit through a bag?
Why do they beat you down?

393
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:58,916
Why I couldn't do nothing
about it?

394
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:04,547
It's all part of the game, right?
I mean, you taught me that.

395
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,687
What you up to in here, man?

396
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:24,817
- Doing the meetings.
- NA?

397
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,404
Yeah. Twice a day.

398
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:33,075
That's good, man. It's good,
you give the body comfort, you know.

399
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,119
Yeah.

400
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:38,539
- No, you needed a change.
- Guess so.

401
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,418
I'll be out at
the end of the month.

402
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,129
They got meetings everywhere.

403
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,089
You ain't gotta worry
about that.

404
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:51,636
Bubs.

405
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:56,641
Who's got the best package now?

406
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,893
- Get the fuck out of here, man.
- I'm coming home, right?

407
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,900
Shit is weak all over, you know?

408
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,986
Got some boys up in Baker
and Calhoun though.

409
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:10,905
They had a smoker out
the other day though.

410
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,324
- Yeah?
- Knocked a couple of niggers out.

411
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,744
Ain't you a trip?

412
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,747
Beat down, bagged up,
still ready to rip and run, huh?

413
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,918
I'm a Viking, homes.

414
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,003
I'm a Viking, homes.

415
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,763
Hey! McNulty!

416
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:39,308
There's something here
that needs kissing.

417
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,395
Speak again, oh, toothless one.

418
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:45,815
I guess you know now why I wear
the stripes in the family.

419
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:49,193
Good call, Jay. If Keeley
hadn't fucked the scene up,

420
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,529
you'd have had that casing
months ago.

421
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,572
Let Keeley be Keeley.

422
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:57,576
We all can't be princes of the city,
now, can we? Speaking of which.

423
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,288
Sit down.

424
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,043
May I ask you a question
essential to your career?

425
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:07,962
- What?
- Who do you serve?

426
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:13,592
I am asking you to identify for the record
your commanding officer.

427
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,136
- Major Rawls.
- Excellent.

428
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:19,890
And with that thought in mind, I advise you
to go immediately into the Major's office,

429
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:23,519
carrying the break I gave you
in the Kresson case and kiss his ring.

430
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:27,022
Because I have talked you
right out of the shithouse.

431
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:31,360
Here's the deal. You wrap up this thing
with Narcotics in two weeks.

432
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:34,488
You put yourself back in rotation
when we go to night work.

433
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:37,491
You do that and
you're back in the fold.

434
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,328
- Thanks, Jay.
- No problem.

435
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,334
- Shit ain't right.
- You work, you get paid.

436
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:50,963
- That's what I'm saying.
- I'm gonna say something to him.

437
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,673
- You should.
- Truth.

438
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,013
- What's up, D?
- What's up, shorty?

439
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,352
530.
The count is right, man.

440
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:09,482
OK, re-ups on the way down.

441
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,108
Go tell Sterling to be
ready for it.

442
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,194
All right. Yo, D, man.

443
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:17,198
You know, me and Poot,
we been steady working it, you know?

444
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,366
Nothing sloppy, no troubles, right?

445
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,285
No.

446
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:26,624
And we was wondering if, maybe you could
let a little something go until payday,

447
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:29,210
'cause you know, right now,
we some broke-ass niggers, man.

448
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:47,394
Right now, whoever did our girl also did
Boyd and Leggett a month earlier.

449
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:48,479
Leggett.

450
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,857
Those two are definitely
straight-up drug executions.

451
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,151
No mention of D in either file.

452
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:59,490
- But I did get a fresh number on Tywanda.
- Who?

453
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,159
The girl who called in on Kresson.

454
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:05,079
- She put D in for that.
- Have you seen this?

455
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,124
Jaybird.

456
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:12,378
And the bear said, you didn't
really come here to hunt now, did you?

457
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:18,634
- You see Saturday's 24s?
- Sunday morning.

458
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,427
Did you see Worden's
on the Westside?

459
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:23,931
John Bailey in a Kevlar vest,
lit up by three separate shooters.

460
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,308
Carey Street.

461
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:30,354
You made the connection. You didn't think
Bailey might tie in with Barksdale?

462
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:35,317
Worden's on the other shift.
I'm trying to work my murders. Jesus Christ.

463
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,653
Tony, Line three.

464
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,658
- What took you so long?
- We get a few murders here in Baltimore.

465
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:43,951
We get backed up.

466
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,120
- You weren't followed here?
- Why would we be followed?

467
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,582
Diedre was playing with scary people.

468
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,167
Who might that be?

469
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,675
You called this in after the murder
and you told the detective

470
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,594
you talked to her
the night she was killed.

471
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,179
She called. It was late.

472
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:08,392
She didn't talk long. She said she had to go.
D was at the door.

473
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,144
That was the last time you spoke?

474
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:14,440
- Yeah, she was killed that night.
- D was her boyfriend?

475
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,611
No, D was his nephew
or something.

476
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:22,948
- D would be D'Angelo Barksdale.
- And the boyfriend, Avon Barksdale?

477
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:27,328
- You know Avon?
- How do you know him?

478
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,663
You running the street
with the players?

479
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:36,211
I used to be, but not after
this thing with Diedre. I mean, damn.

480
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,757
We used to go to Odell's
for ladies' nights

481
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:43,761
and one time he was there with
all his people in one of the big booths,

482
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:46,388
ordering drinks,
acting like he was king of everything.

483
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:49,183
And Diedre ate that shit up.

484
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,561
- And you?
- I ain't gonna lie.

485
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,190
I did the club thing
for a while, but...

486
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,528
Some of those places,
everybody there's on some kind of game.

487
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,489
But Diedre went with Avon?

488
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,200
She was with Avon for like a year

489
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,952
and something happened.

490
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,245
She started getting possessive.

491
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,456
That didn't sit with Avon,
'cause he has other girls too.

492
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,334
She was bitching on him
one minute,

493
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,045
crying the next,
threatening to do all kinds of things.

494
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,256
- She threatened Avon Barksdale?
- The girl was off the hook.

495
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,051
One time, she threatened
to write a letter on him.

496
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,263
- A letter.
- A letter to the state's attorney.

497
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,724
Supposed to be some
sort of kin to her.

498
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:36,063
She said that if he dumped her,
she was gonna tell about the drugs.

499
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,066
- Did she write this letter?
- I don't know.

500
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:43,278
I tried talking about the way
she was acting, but she wouldn't let it go.

501
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,533
She had it out with him in his club
in front of all the people.

502
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:48,867
Avon has a club?

503
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:51,328
Orlando's, titty bar.

504
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:54,081
- Does he own it?
- That's what Diedre said.

505
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:56,250
She said he owned
a whole mess of stuff.

506
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,394
- Tell me something, man.
- What's that?

507
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:19,273
How can you run this place
and not just OD on pussy?

508
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:23,986
Shit. You try dealing with all these bitches
and their problems for a few days.

509
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,364
Get so you'd rather be running
a damn laundromat out this fucker.

510
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,118
Heard you're doing OK
in the Pit.

511
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:35,289
- Yeah, well...
- What, you ain't getting it like that?

512
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,043
My uncle got me working
on salary.

513
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:43,213
Damn, boy. You ain't the only one
your uncle keeps close.

514
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,633
- What?
- Come on, man, you ain't making no ends?

515
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,886
I know you getting a little
something on this.

516
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:53,140
No, man. I'm just the front,
clean name for the liquor board.

517
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:55,225
- I'm saying...
- Fuck!

518
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,187
Is there a problem?
That was for the drink before.

519
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:03,358
It ain't like I'm calling your uncle out
or nothing but give a nigger a chance.

520
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:06,570
- Plenty of pie for everybody.
- Believe.

521
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,407
You heard Stinkum
gonna be getting a percentage.

522
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:12,826
- What?
- Open up fresh territory.

523
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:15,412
Take over the corners
down near Edmondson and Brice.

524
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,832
So, my uncle gave that to Stink?

525
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:21,335
- Orlando!
- Figured you knew.

526
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,921
Orlando!

527
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,758
Can you help me down here?

528
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:31,178
- I already paid for that last drink.
- That was for the drink before.

529
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,472
- That was for this one.
- What's up?

530
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,892
Look, he ain't paid for that drink
and I took $20 off the bar.

531
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,937
- Look she took 20, then 20 more.
- Hell I did.

532
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:42,606
Why you gonna do me like this?

533
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,025
I been with you for an hour
buying drinks.

534
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,822
Look, man, this ain't right.
I just spent $120 in drinks, $40 in tips.

535
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:52,866
You gonna take all that
and try to sneak into my pocket?

536
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:55,911
- Shit, girl!
- You got to go, get him the fuck outta here.

537
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,330
I ain't done so much
as touch your kneecap.

538
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:02,209
Trying to treat her with respect,
and this is the way you do me?

539
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,877
Wait.

540
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,387
OK, man, I'm goin',
I'm out of here.

541
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,559
Why you do that?

542
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,438
- Did you take his money?
- No, I didn't take his money.

543
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,245
You buying me a drink?

544
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:43,542
Can I see you sometime?
Like, you know, not in here.

545
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,721
I don't usually see men
that I meet in here.

546
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:05,981
Usually.

547
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,322
What kind of strip joint
has a video camera looking out?

548
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,783
More to it than the girls, maybe.

549
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:20,537
So, he's got the club,
he's got the warehouse,

550
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:23,373
he's got the apartment
by Druid Hill Lake,

551
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,250
he's got the tow truck company,

552
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:28,962
and that's just what she knew from
what he bragged about to the dead girl.

553
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:32,758
- Major likes assets.
- The deputy too, I imagine.

554
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:36,553
Nothing like property forfeitures
to swell the departmental budget.

555
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,306
Check city assessments to see
who owns the club.

556
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,476
Run the company name
through the charter office.

557
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:46,396
Also, Homicide picked up one Saturday night.
Might be one of ours.

558
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:50,609
John Bailey, he's a stick-up artist
I used to know from the Murphy homes.

559
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:55,239
He was wearing Kevlar. 39 casings
on the scene, from three different guns.

560
00:42:55,657 --> 00:43:00,744
Overkill for a burn bag but about
right if he was running with Omar.

561
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,329
Look. Our buddy.

562
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,511
Just once, I wish
they'd use the right number.

563
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,269
Ain't like him to be late.

564
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:34,111
Bailey, you fucking dope fiend.

565
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:39,574
I'm telling you.
Them fucking people ain't to be relied on.

566
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,703
- Why you always talk like that, man?
- What?

567
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:44,454
F this and F that.

568
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:50,419
If I give it up,
I lose half of what I mean to say.

569
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,880
Don't nobody wanna
hear them dirty words, man.

570
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,884
Especially coming
from such a beautiful mouth.

571
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,984
Wait for Bailey?

572
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:18,613
Early bird catches the worm, dog.

573
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:47,351
- I beeped you.
- I didn't get it.

574
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:49,853
- Let me see.
- You want to see my pager?

575
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,897
Yeah.

576
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,441
Sure, Prez,
you want to see my pager?

577
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,904
- I beeped you too.
- You all right, Prez?

578
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,281
714-3432?

579
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,701
I got that. That was you?

580
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,953
You try it?

581
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,831
I tried it. Twice.
Non-working number.

582
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:12,751
It would've worked
if you knew the code.

583
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:20,258
- Shit.
- I'm as surprised as you.

584
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:25,138
I like word-search puzzles.

585
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:27,349
You know, where you gotta
find the hidden words?

586
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:31,186
So I thought I could do
the same thing with the numbers.

587
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:38,151
Take the number I sent you.
Now take the seven and jump it over the five.

588
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:44,408
You get three. Jump the one
over the five, you get nine.

589
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,577
With four you get six.

590
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:52,332
Three, that's seven, four is six.
A three again...

591
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:55,710
and two is eight.

592
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,838
Zero switches with the five.

593
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:02,342
So 714-3432 is...

594
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:06,179
396-7678.

595
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,181
Our number.

596
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:11,935
- And that's the code?
- Yeah.

597
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,522
And it works because it's all about
where the buttons are on a phone.

598
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:20,694
If it was a code that involved math
or algebra or whatever,

599
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:24,197
these little yos in the projects
wouldn't be able to follow along.

600
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:28,285
But with this, all you gotta do
is jump the five button.

601
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:32,664
Ain't no math to it. It's just how
a phone looks when you look at it.

602
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,500
Prez, you little genius!

603
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:40,380
- Jesus.
- I could kill you, that's so good.

604
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:49,055
Your mother keep ragging at me to take him
outta here and put him in a nursing home.

605
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,392
Yeah, bro. She ain't never
gonna let that go.

606
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:55,979
I keep telling her, man,
we can't show this legit money yet,

607
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,814
since he ain't got no insurance.

608
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,150
Soon, though, soon.

609
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:04,404
So, you ain't big
on coming here, right?

610
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,531
No.

611
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:10,994
Tell you something. You about to see
your uncle, you understand me?

612
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,330
- This is family.
- I know.

613
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:15,790
Family is what counts,
family is what it's about.

614
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,752
Family gonna always be there
'cause it's blood.

615
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:34,893
Man.

616
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,940
Dr. Galls, please.

617
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,820
You never figured on
this, did you?

618
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,453
Live the life, lead the life.
Ain't no big thing.

619
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:57,249
He used to talk that shit all the time
and he believed it, you know what I'm saying?

620
00:47:58,167 --> 00:47:59,751
What's up, baby?
Talk that shit now.

621
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:07,300
You know, you're right.
It's kind of hard to be in here right now.

622
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,303
He scare you, don't he?

623
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:14,516
- You know, I'm just saying.
- He scares me.

624
00:48:19,272 --> 00:48:21,106
Yeah.

625
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,985
See, if he dead,
I could carry it better.

626
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:27,279
Coming up the way we did,
you kind of expect that.

627
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,657
Waiting on it.

628
00:48:31,284 --> 00:48:36,079
See, the thing is,
you only got to fuck up once.

629
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:42,460
Be a little slow, be a little late.
Just once.

630
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,840
And how you ain't gonna
never be slow,

631
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,384
never be late?

632
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:55,307
You can't plan for no shit
like this, man. It's life.

633
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:02,355
Yeah.

634
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,111
It scares me.

635
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:25,211
They're still using it. I was by
on Saturday night and it was gone.

636
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:26,796
On your own time?

637
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:33,887
- You still getting your boys?
- Yeah, tonight for a sleep-over.

638
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,764
Omar's rolling.

639
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:53,239
What the hell?

640
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:55,325
Call for backup?

641
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:57,243
Not yet.

642
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,037
Let's see how it plays out.

643
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:19,766
An invitation.

644
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,310
- Feel a little lonesome for backup.
- Me too.

645
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:28,441
- That's nice. I'll check the rear.
- I'll watch the boys.

646
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,996
Afternoon, gentlemen.

647
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:44,791
Saying, if you were gonna use that
you would've used it by now.

648
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:51,965
It's clean.

649
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,842
Got to keep it clean.

650
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:57,512
We having one of our little parlays like
this, got to keep it clean, right?

651
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:01,307
Omar with no gun on the street?
Must be a first.

652
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:03,727
Sometimes who you are is enough.

653
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:10,066
But being as y'all sitting on my ride so long,
I thought I'd save y'all some time.

654
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:12,902
I ain't taking no charge.
You ain't putting me back in a cage.

655
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,407
We're not here to bury you. We're pulling
you up 'cause we got a problem in common.

656
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:19,951
- Problem?
- Barksdale.

657
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,787
- No, he ain't no problem.
- I don't know.

658
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:25,623
Avon's been chalking up a lot of bodies.
And you being you...

659
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,502
Put it that way,
I guess he could be a little problem...

660
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,338
but I can't come out and help you.

661
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:36,176
You know what I mean?
Snitchin' just rubs me wrong.

662
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:38,344
Personally, I don't think
the game is played like that.

663
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,681
We respect that.

664
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:46,436
If you do happen to take a charge though,
I'm McNulty, that's Greggs.

665
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:48,938
You give us a call,
we'll sort something out.

666
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,483
Fair enough.

667
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:55,695
You know, I used to work the homes,
back when your brother was up there.

668
00:51:57,281 --> 00:52:00,867
You get a chance, let him know
they blew up John Bailey last night.

669
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:07,040
Good man. Lot of enemies.

670
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:10,543
Are you trying to catch up with Bird?

671
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:14,881
Word is he dropped a workin' man.

672
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:20,303
Wait, hold up. Come on, don't play me.
What working man? What Bird?

673
00:52:20,513 --> 00:52:22,847
Come on, now.
Ain't but one working man, is there?

674
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:27,352
And Bird?
I think your snitch can handle that.

675
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:29,646
Shit, Bubbles know Bird.

676
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,860
- You working late?
- A little.

677
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:18,528
Got a minute?

678
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,030
Sure, have a seat.

679
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:23,950
No, this is better said standing up.

680
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,078
You know, I've been 13 years on the shelf.
I ain't bitched.

681
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:32,959
It was me that put me there.
But I'm here now, and I gotta say a piece.

682
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:37,505
We should've had a tap
on the project pay phones by now.

683
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,758
A wire there will get us the drugs.

684
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,511
Keep pushing,
we'll get a whiff of the money too.

685
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,140
I know you're serious
about climbing that career ladder

686
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:51,769
and I know how slippery it gets
the higher you go, but for me,

687
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:55,648
I don't want to go to no dance
unless I can rub some tit.

688
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:59,068
I appreciate your honesty.

689
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:02,780
Good night, Lieutenant.

690
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,098
What did you say to make
D pay out?

691
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:32,268
I told him to give it up
or I'm taking him out of the count.

692
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:35,688
- Shit.
- Look. I'll pump niggers when I got to.

693
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,077
- That's him.
- That's who?

694
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:52,038
One of the ones that robbed us.
That light-skinned boy.

695
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:57,543
That's him? All right, come on.

696
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:05,802
I'm the king of this shit.

697
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,192
- So, you want us to wait?
- Yeah.

698
00:56:03,736 --> 00:56:06,821
- All right. We on it, man.
- All right.

699
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:21,461
Hey, dog. Hey, yo, hey, yo.

700
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,171
There goes Scar right there.

701
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:27,633
- Right there in the blue? Number 80?
- Yeah, I'm on him.

702
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:45,985
All right, you got him?

703
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:51,199
Find a phone real quick. It looks like
my man D got himself an emergency.

704
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:53,242
What, he been stuck up again?

705
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,048
What's up, what do you need?

706
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:09,842
My people are onto one of Omar's
boys down at Greek's.

707
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,846
- All right, sit tight. I'll take care of it.
- All right.

708
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:25,399
Ain't nobody coming.

709
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:29,195
Yeah. D said wait. D said wait.

710
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:43,626
Told you.

711
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:54,762
- Yo, he still in there?
- Yeah, he's playing the games.

712
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:57,557
All right. You sharp, son.
What's your name?

713
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:00,476
- Wallace.
- Wallace, all right.

714
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:03,104
This nigger's gonna
point him out to us, all right?

715
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:25,042
- Yeah.
- Yo, it's done. Nice work, cuz.

716
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:27,044
All right.
