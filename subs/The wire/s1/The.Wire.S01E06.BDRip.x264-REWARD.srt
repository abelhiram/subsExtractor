1
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,840
Rise and shine!
Come on, man, get up!

2
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:37,263
Come on, get up! School day.
Y'all gonna be late!

3
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,265
Let's go.
Get up for school.

4
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,768
Go! Get up. Come on, man.

5
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,811
- Damn, Wallace.
- Damn, nothing!

6
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:46,481
Y'all know what happens
if you don't go to school?

7
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:50,109
They're gonna be callin' and
all y'all gonna end up in foster care.

8
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:53,237
If y'all want foster care,
climb your asses back into bed.

9
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,699
Get outta my way, man.
Damn, it's too early for this shit.

10
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,982
- Narcos?
- No, rollers.

11
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,110
Yo, where's breakfast at?

12
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,321
Here, man. You get two.

13
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,158
- I want two bags.
- You don't get two.

14
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,536
Come on, getting greedy.
Take the chips!

15
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,746
Come on. Take your juice.

16
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,292
Come on, man.

17
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,753
Where mine?

18
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,799
Go show your teacher.
Come on, man.

19
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:11,691
- Where's your book bag?
- Teacher ain't give no homework.

20
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:31,711
That's the worst case of suicide
I've ever seen.

21
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,629
That's him.

22
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,384
You see?

23
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,762
That's him, right there.

24
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,723
That's Omar's boy.

25
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:09,290
<i>If you walk through the garden</i>

26
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,001
<i>You better watch your back</i>

27
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,339
<i>Well I beg your pardon</i>

28
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,508
<i>Walk the straight
and narrow track</i>

29
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:24,013
<i>If you walk with Jesus</i>

30
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,183
<i>He'll save your soul</i>

31
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,520
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

32
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,231
<i>Down in the hole</i>

33
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,402
<i>All the angels sing</i>

34
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,323
<i>About Jesus' mighty sword</i>

35
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:46,243
<i>And they shield you
with their wings</i>

36
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,623
<i>Keep you close to the Lord</i>

37
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,918
<i>Don't pay heed to temptation</i>

38
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:58,130
<i>For his hands are so cold</i>

39
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,009
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

40
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,388
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

41
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,482
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

42
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,194
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

43
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:24,699
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

44
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,702
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

45
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:39,338
- What the fuck can I tell him?
- Whatever the man wants to hear, Jimmy.

46
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:43,926
Prodigal son.

47
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:49,432
Major, we got a good shot
at clearing a couple of cases here.

48
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:53,102
We're not here to talk cases.
I don't care about your cases. Sit.

49
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,772
Relax.

50
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,650
I'm a reasonable guy.

51
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,194
In fact, everywhere I go,
people say to me,

52
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,448
Bill Rawls, you are
a reasonable fucking guy.

53
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,159
- Am I right, Jay?
- You are reasonable, sir.

54
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,661
Yes. Yes, I am.

55
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,247
Because he knows me
to be reasonable,

56
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,875
he came in a few weeks ago
and reasoned with me. Right, Jay?

57
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,002
We reasoned. We did.

58
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:22,131
We reasoned that despite
his negligible Irish ancestry,

59
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:27,011
and a propensity to talk out of turn,
Jimmy McNulty is a good worker.

60
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,764
Probably worth saving.

61
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,683
- Major, I'm not...
- He's a good-looking kid.

62
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,731
Do you know what we do
here, McNulty?

63
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,400
What we do here?

64
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:45,154
That was one of them... What is it?
A question you don't have to...

65
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:49,950
A rhetorical question. You were being
rhetorical. Rhetorical and reasonable, sir.

66
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:55,581
We work murder cases here, as they come in,
one at a fucking time. It's a rotation.

67
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,918
You're up till you catch one,
then you step down, work it,

68
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,461
someone else steps up.

69
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:07,551
It's a simple but effective way to do business
in a town that has 250 to 300 cases a year.

70
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:08,886
Yes, sir.

71
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,098
But if someone gets it into his head
to leave the rotation,

72
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,935
it puts an unfair burden on the detectives
who have to pick up their casework.

73
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:21,941
Overworked cops make mistakes.
Mistakes lower the unit-wide clearance rate.

74
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:26,529
And that can make someone
who is otherwise as reasonable as me...

75
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,450
Unreasonable.

76
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,960
Detective McNulty, I expect to see
your ass back here next week

77
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,629
when your shift rotates
to night work.

78
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,896
<i>Night shows up and the beat goes on
like one of those nights that goes on too long</i>

79
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,150
<i>Maybe one of those songs that
could have cut the fuck off a long time ago</i>

80
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:09,196
<i>My friend says at his stop...
should have just followed</i>

81
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,157
<i>I read the laws,
the hip-hop laws</i>

82
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,659
<i>You know those laws,
there's laws to the hip-hop game</i>

83
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,953
<i>Should have read that book
that I recommended</i>

84
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,232
<i>'Cause if you did,
you would see...</i>

85
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,751
<i>If you don't have
a hip-hop license...</i>

86
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:33,053
- He's up early today.
- A lot of pager activity last night too.

87
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,397
<i>Respect,
tell me one thing about respect</i>

88
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,940
<i>Can you mock respect?</i>

89
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,067
<i>Bad man, I respecting</i>

90
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,450
<i>Respect...</i>

91
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,080
No woman takes that long.

92
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:10,299
Yeah.
But I look good, right?

93
00:09:17,998 --> 00:09:19,308
You did all this?

94
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,395
- Burned an egg or two. Ain't no thing.
- Yeah?

95
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,982
My mama always said,
don't let them get to cooking.

96
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,653
Once they're in the kitchen,
you have to give 'em a key to your house.

97
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,364
I don't want no key.
I don't want no house.

98
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,158
And your mama
don't know shit about me.

99
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,535
Looks just like you.

100
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,913
Yeah, he do.

101
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:46,085
- Where's his mother?
- Around the way.

102
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,629
You friends?

103
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,424
You know, she want a key.

104
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,595
She want a house, she want a car,
she want some new clothes, a necklace,

105
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,267
some pocket change, a trip to the shore,
she want a credit card with her name on it.

106
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,477
Ain't no such thing as free, right?

107
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,480
When it come to pussy,
there ain't no free.

108
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,777
I gotta go.

109
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,082
<i>Sometimes I wander
under the sun I used to wonder</i>

110
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,710
<i>Were you in the same
situation...</i>

111
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,799
Been working on this one. You'll get the lines
on the other two pay phones tomorrow.

112
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,760
- So we up?
- On the low-rise pay phones.

113
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,387
Let's hear it.

114
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:44,143
What I'm talking about is he ain't paid
no one, he just think it's right to do it.

115
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,855
See how it goes?
So I ain't got shit. I ain't got it.

116
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,398
Damn. For real?

117
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,526
Thinking he all that
because he got his family back.

118
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,531
- It was getting good.
- It's unmonitored.

119
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,907
It's what?

120
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,453
We can't listen to a conversation
on an unmonitored pay phone.

121
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,123
- What's that mean?
- We got a tap on the courtyard pay phone.

122
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,751
By tomorrow,
we'll be on two near the high-rises.

123
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:12,963
We can't listen to anything unless we know
one of our targets is using the phone.

124
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:17,634
We gotta be on those rooftops for hours
watching these assholes talk on the phone?

125
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,261
Yep.

126
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,013
It's more bullshit.

127
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,723
Detective,

128
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:26,268
this right here, this is the job.

129
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,564
Now, when you came downtown to CID,
what other kind of work were you expecting?

130
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,526
So what are you gonna do?

131
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,905
I can't get back here in a week,
this case is taking off.

132
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,449
You tell Rawls that?

133
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,577
- No.
- McNulty, line three.

134
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,290
Yeah.

135
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,502
Where at?

136
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:55,089
800 block, in the rear.
I got it.

137
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,258
Thanks. Yeah.

138
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:30,833
- Come in 22.
- 22.

139
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,253
We're still waiting on a lab unit.
Do you have an ETA?

140
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,338
Negative. They're all out.

141
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:41,051
- Damn dog got Norris too.
- You didn't think to warn me?

142
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:43,137
Too much fun not to.

143
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,975
- Damn.
- Yeah. Is he one of yours?

144
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,437
We found him with Kevlar,
like the one Worden caught.

145
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,939
- We thought it was a connection.
- It connects.

146
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,441
How so?

147
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,902
Don't have a name,
but he's part of a stick-up crew.

148
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:02,698
Took off a stash house last month.
My guy, Barksdale, is coming back on them.

149
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,827
- In a big way.
- They must've killed him four or five times.

150
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,873
Cut him in a dozen places, burned him
with cigarettes. Torture is what it was.

151
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:15,794
- Doesn't look like your scene.
- Fuck him up, dump him here for all to see.

152
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,213
- Anything we can use?
- Not yet.

153
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,717
We're up on some phones.
If I hear anything, I'll let you know.

154
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,595
- Bring 22.
- 22.

155
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,806
Anything yet? Or are we just gonna let
this guy go ripe on us?

156
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:30,851
- You been waiting for crime lab?
- Over an hour.

157
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,646
Two units on the street. Both are
at the City Council President's house.

158
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,900
- What happened there?
- Someone stole his lawn furniture.

159
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:42,196
They're taking pictures of an empty patio,
dusting the backyard gate for latents.

160
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,447
I kid you not.

161
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,576
You show me the son of a bitch
who can fix this police department,

162
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,162
I'd give back half my overtime.

163
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:53,916
He was all cut up and shit.
His insides was hanging out.

164
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,794
Fucked up, yo.
I mean, damn.

165
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,881
Sometimes you gotta send
a message.

166
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:06,136
I mean, when you picked up that phone,
what did you think they were gonna do?

167
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,972
All that shit is in the game.
You know that.

168
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,517
Yeah.
Like you and that girl?

169
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,354
- What girl?
- The one in the apartment.

170
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,106
The one you told us about,
remember?

171
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,652
I mean, I like what you said
about all that killing, you know?

172
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:25,197
Especially that part
about how it ain't gotta be like that.

173
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,907
Just sell the shit and move on.

174
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,743
Get me a ginger ale
and get something for yourself.

175
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,247
I remember that.
But it ain't like that, is it?

176
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:36,792
Yeah, I know it ain't.

177
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,378
Thing about it was his eye.
His eye was blown out.

178
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:43,632
And the other one was open.
And yo, Dee, it fucks me up.

179
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:47,636
It's like he's looking out,
like he sees everything, you know?

180
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,138
Don't think about it.

181
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,432
I c...

182
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,977
- Fuck!
- Yo.

183
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,980
Let that shit go.

184
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,941
Just let it go.

185
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,926
Barksdale kid on the line.

186
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,846
He's beeping someone.

187
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,281
Go deep.

188
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,248
- Yo.
- What up?

189
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:00,876
Hold on.

190
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,046
Yo, Strings! This is Dee.

191
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,799
Yeah. You hit me?

192
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:12,804
I wanted to know if you know a young
hopper, the one they got down there.

193
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,266
- Which one?
- The fool, drop in there with a punch.

194
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:19,728
- What about him?
- He got some problems, right?

195
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,607
- What you mean?
- Enough to bring home, right?

196
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,443
You know, man, whatever.

197
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,488
All right.

198
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,594
They're bringing Bodie home.

199
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,435
The young, light-skinned kid
from the cemetery.

200
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,561
Where?

201
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:04,648
In the alley behind Argyle,
across from the low-rises.

202
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:05,941
Shot?

203
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,985
- Stabbed, beaten, burned.
- Jesus.

204
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,321
- We gotta get with Omar.
- Yeah.

205
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,125
Impressive.

206
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:28,463
I don't often see a respondent come so
prepared for a juvenile commitment meeting.

207
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,550
In addition to the statements
from Preston's sponsors

208
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,510
at the Police Athletic League,

209
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,930
I also have a Photostatted copy
of a cashed check

210
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,599
which indicates he is enrolled
in the GED program

211
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:42,144
at the Baltimore City
Community College.

212
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:49,943
Can I ask how this young man is able to afford
not one but two attorneys from your firm?

213
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,987
This is pro bono, Your Honor.

214
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,407
My firm is making it a priority
to identify a number of youths

215
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:59,953
who are in crisis, and to undertake
efforts to reorder their lives.

216
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:04,249
I can't help but notice that
your client is under a delinquent petition

217
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,669
for the sale of narcotics
and for assault on a police officer.

218
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,547
Beyond that,
he walked away from a JSA facility.

219
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,883
My client stands ready
to acknowledge

220
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:16,762
that he was involved for a time
in the sale of a small amount of drugs,

221
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,473
for which he received
no remuneration,

222
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:23,685
having been manipulated
by older traffickers in his neighborhood.

223
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,938
- That was a mistake, Your Honor.
- So noted.

224
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:31,359
We will contend that it was Preston
who was the victim of a brutal police beating,

225
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,237
indications of which
are still evident on him.

226
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:37,824
He struck back,
wildly and in self-defense, Your Honor.

227
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,326
And the walk-away?

228
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,871
Preston was heavily medicated
when he left the Cheltenham facility.

229
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:48,710
In that state, Your Honor, he was simply
trying to get back to see his grandmother.

230
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:54,424
Did you know what you were doing
when you left the Boys' Village, son?

231
00:18:55,968 --> 00:19:00,096
- No, I was messed up.
- Anything else you'd like to add?

232
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,392
Just...

233
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,353
I don't know...

234
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,188
I'm ready to be good.

235
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:14,820
Pending a hearing on these charges
to be scheduled within six months,

236
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:18,573
I'm putting the respondent on
home monitoring with his grandmother.

237
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:23,829
I'm afraid Mrs. Brodus doesn't have
a telephone for any monitoring calls.

238
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,330
She's on a fixed income,
Your Honor.

239
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:29,251
How about he calls his probation
officer twice a week?

240
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,547
Cool. Whatever.

241
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,549
Your Honor.

242
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,788
- Yo, Bubbles, what's the game?
- Hey, Johnny.

243
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,207
- Rubbing them down?
- Yeah.

244
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,251
Bubbs.

245
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,379
- What is the scam out here?
- Ain't no scam.

246
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,339
Thank you, ma'am.

247
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:20,260
What you got here is an honest day's work
for an honest day's pay. Right?

248
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,387
Mr. Straight Time, Bubbles.

249
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,140
Gotta give something back
when they least expect it.

250
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,518
Me and Uck, we got something on too.
We got a plan.

251
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,979
- No shit.
- For real.

252
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,155
We're gonna take off
on the copper house.

253
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,908
Your first two days out
and you get dramatic on me.

254
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,951
- Copper house.
- Got to be got, homes.

255
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:47,829
- What about the fence?
- Fuck the fence.

256
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,790
- What about the dog?
- Fuck the dog.

257
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,836
All that time I was resting,
it got me thinking. It got good to me too.

258
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,381
Copper house. Gracious.

259
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,178
I gotta go, can you cash me out?

260
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:06,097
If you ain't got dreams, Bubbs,
what the fuck you got?

261
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,933
Thank you. Come on, dreamer.

262
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,043
Yeah?

263
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,879
- One of ours on the line.
- Got him.

264
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,841
- Is Carv still there?
- Hold a second.

265
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,760
Carv, call for you!

266
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:47,806
- Hello?
- You ain't gonna believe who I'm looking at.

267
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,475
Again he walks off?

268
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,311
Ding! Round three.

269
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,407
- Yo.
- What up, man?

270
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,493
- Yo, Stink, what up?
- Where are your manners, fool?

271
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,997
- My bad.
- You need to keep your fucking head, boy.

272
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,666
Forgot...

273
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:19,087
- What's up? Where you at?
- Where you at?

274
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:22,132
I'm down in the Pit.
I just came home...

275
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:25,593
I don't see nobody around,
I just wanted to know what was up.

276
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,929
Ain't nothing going late, man.

277
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,100
Just catch us tomorrow, man.

278
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,602
All right?

279
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,479
All right. Later.

280
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,945
Non-pertinent?

281
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,281
How do you log that non-pertinent?

282
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,617
No drug talk.

283
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,579
They use codes that hide
their pager and phone numbers.

284
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:56,541
And when someone does use a phone,
they don't use names.

285
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:59,669
And if someone does use a name,
he's reminded not to.

286
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,088
All of that is valuable evidence.

287
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,800
- Of what?
- Conspiracy.

288
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,054
Conspiracy?

289
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:14,100
We're building something here, Detective.
We're building it from scratch.

290
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:17,395
All the pieces matter.

291
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,189
All right?

292
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,161
Shit.

293
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,835
- Are you fucking serious?
- Fuck, man.

294
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,089
You keep walking away from JSA,
we keep kicking your ass.

295
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:47,759
- I'm all right with that if you are.
- I ain't walking away from nowhere.

296
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,677
Check my back pocket.

297
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:01,147
- Home monitoring?
- Yeah, man.

298
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:05,443
If you ask questions before you start wildin'
on niggers, you might save trouble.

299
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:09,030
- How the fuck are you home?
- You ain't bright, man.

300
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,949
Juvenile judge, man.

301
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,868
He saw my potential.
He expects big things from me.

302
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,411
Like what?

303
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:19,290
I don't know, college, law school,
medical school, all that good shit.

304
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:23,294
- Seriously, how are you out?
- Look, I'm gonna tell you something.

305
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:27,715
This is just my opinion, but the juvenile
system in this city is fucked up.

306
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,385
It's a big-ass fucking joke.
No offence.

307
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,972
Fucking fuck!

308
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,853
Hey, you could give me a ride down
to my grandma's, we'll call it even.

309
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,399
In back, fucknuts.

310
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:17,432
Jay.

311
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,279
Get outta the street!

312
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,572
Bitch!

313
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,119
- Hey.
- Hey.

314
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,706
What's up? What you need?

315
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,006
- Little late in the month for this shit, isn't it?
- What you mean?

316
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:00,016
- For my aunt, she hit the Match Four.
- You stealing from me, Cass?

317
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:14,989
What?

318
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,078
You look fresh today.

319
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:24,499
- Got laid last night, that's why.
- Your asshole still hurting?

320
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:28,336
- Call Jimmy.
- What's up, boss?

321
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:33,466
Rawls finally got around to reading the office
reports that McNulty tried to give him.

322
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,135
He wants arrest warrants
for Diedre Kresson

323
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,222
and the two project murders
that match up to that gun.

324
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:42,558
I know.

325
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:47,730
- Come on, Jay. Be right on this.
- I can't. It's Rawls, he wants warrants today.

326
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,858
All right. Who the fuck
are we supposed to charge?

327
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:56,656
A witness that puts D'Angelo Barksdale at the
scene of the murder, the night of the murder.

328
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,450
You got a ballistics match
between the Kresson girl

329
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:03,705
and the two dead mopes in the project
where Barksdale hangs. Run with it.

330
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,166
This weak-ass shit
is not gonna get past a Grand Jury.

331
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:10,420
Charge the mope,
and work it more afterward.

332
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,590
Call Jimmy, let him know.

333
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,803
Yo.

334
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,351
All right, listen up.
New deal.

335
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,813
Wallace, you're gonna be on the stash now
with Latroy and Peaches.

336
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,273
What about Sterling?

337
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,901
He's gonna be down on Crescent,
looking out for a while.

338
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,862
- What happened?
- Nothing.

339
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:40,033
- Then why you wanna change everything?
- Nigger, I gotta explain shit to you now?

340
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,999
Stringer Bell's pager number?

341
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:52,045
- Stinkum's too, I'm pretty sure.
- Very sweet.

342
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:55,131
If they moved around,
we would have problems.

343
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,924
They're a little lazy, you know.

344
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:01,596
Tend to go to that one pay phone
in the courtyard a little too much.

345
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,349
Jesus.

346
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,853
He's lit at 9:00 in the morning?

347
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,314
Or from the night before.

348
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:19,947
Detective.

349
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,202
Detective Polk.

350
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:36,297
It's McNulty. Bunk paged me.

351
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:39,467
All right.

352
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,895
Why did you even come in today?

353
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,732
- I had some...
- To pretend that you were here?

354
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:56,651
To fill out a run sheet?

355
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,571
I know I missed a couple of days
last week, but...

356
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:03,408
I got a run sheet from you every day
for the last two weeks.

357
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:07,620
Twice in Carv's handwriting,
twice it was Prez, once it was McNulty.

358
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,540
They covered for you.

359
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,625
But I won't.

360
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,420
Well, Lieutenant, I...

361
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:22,677
I don't know. I'm not really up
for this drug thing, you know?

362
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:28,307
Maybe if Mahone was here, I could get into
it more, learn some new tricks.

363
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:35,940
Why don't you send me back to Property
and keep everyone happy?

364
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,860
Send you back
so you can binge for two more weeks?

365
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:40,903
I'm not doing that.

366
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:44,407
- Lieutenant, please...
- You were dumped on me, Augie.

367
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:47,034
But it ends there.
I don't dump people.

368
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:52,415
You either go out on those rooftops today
to watch pay phones with the others

369
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:55,835
or you go over to the medical office
and check yourself in.

370
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,881
- Medical?
- For alcohol abuse.

371
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:03,843
Either dry yourself out
or go up on those rooftops wet.

372
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,395
Take a few minutes
and think about it.

373
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,407
- Where'd they go?
- Who?

374
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:35,458
Lieutenant, we need a file cabinet or two.
The paperwork from this, I mean...

375
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,877
There's a lot of it.

376
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,420
Lieutenant?

377
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,590
Sir.

378
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,468
I'm going to...

379
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:50,932
Good luck with the case.

380
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,859
Fucking Rawls,
he's fucking up the case to get to me.

381
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:06,405
He's fucking it up for three paper
clearances on prior cases. It ain't personal.

382
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:09,116
All he's got is D'Angelo
at the scene

383
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:12,954
and a ballistics match to unrelated
drug murders. How can he charge that?

384
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,498
He can charge anything he wants
to get credit.

385
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,417
Grand jury doesn't indict,
he drops the case.

386
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:21,337
- I'll go tell him what he can do.
- You don't.

387
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:25,091
I'm trying to build something.
Rawls sticks a finger in my eye.

388
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:27,635
- You talk to Landsman?
- Jay can't fix this.

389
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:30,513
Rawls told him
to have the warrants by morning.

390
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:34,225
He's gonna charge murders he can't prove
just to get the stats?

391
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,851
And fuck up our case.

392
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,730
We give up the motive for the Kresson
killing in the documents,

393
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:41,816
and Avon Barksdale is
gonna change up.

394
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,152
What he don't change he'll clean up.
Somebody should tell Rawls.

395
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:48,447
Rawls couldn't care less.
He wants the stats, that's all.

396
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,491
Then we take it to Daniels.

397
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,910
- He'll fight for it.
- He won't do shit.

398
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,538
He plays stiff now and then,
but he's a good man.

399
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:59,584
Are you kidding me? He's been trying to put
the brakes on this for weeks now.

400
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,919
This'll be his new excuse
to close shop.

401
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:05,339
You guys gotta make your move soon,
I'm sorry to say.

402
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:08,551
- Freamon.
- All right, Bunk, take care.

403
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:14,265
- We tell Daniels.
- Fuck Daniels and his ass-kissing ambition.

404
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,350
What other choice you got?

405
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,728
We go to Daniels.
If he fights, he fights.

406
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:22,940
If he gives it up to Rawls, then fuck it,
we were never gonna do the case anyway.

407
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,445
All right, come on.

408
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:04,523
Fucking idiot!

409
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:10,321
- Come on, get up, stupid.
- I'm hurt, man.

410
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,990
What are you doing? Leave me alone!

411
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:15,034
- What are you on, dope?
- Mostly.

412
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,577
Come on, get up.

413
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:20,206
You trying to rip out my guts?

414
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:23,000
What, are you trying
to kill me, man?

415
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:26,212
- Wait! Where are you going?
- Listen, I gotta get help.

416
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,506
You can't leave me here.
Stay with me.

417
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,424
Let's go over to the curb.

418
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:33,594
Just go get help, man!
What are you doing?

419
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,388
Stay there!

420
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:41,185
- Damn, boy! What the hell come out of you?
- Onion soup. Campbell's.

421
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,729
- My plan!
- Run, Forrest, run!

422
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:49,402
You could go to Forester,
or the Deputy Ops.

423
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:54,281
Why come crying to me?
Why not go to your friend, the judge?

424
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:59,078
I don't see a judge being able to argue the city
homicide commander out of three murders,

425
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:03,958
even if the cases are all weak sisters.
It's put-up or shut-up time, Lieutenant.

426
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:07,420
- Either you step up or you send us all home.
- So this is on me?

427
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:10,631
I don't see anyone else
in charge of this detail.

428
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,593
- Rawls is a major.
- Rawls is an asshole.

429
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,389
My point is,
he ranks me on this.

430
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,685
Chain of command might mean
nothing to you, McNulty.

431
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,484
What'd I tell you?

432
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:38,219
- Yo, how we doing?
- We doing good.

433
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,970
We doing good.

434
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,556
You know, if you say we doing good...

435
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,768
So what's up?

436
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,562
So the word is out
about these stick-up boys, right?

437
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:51,982
- Yeah, yeah. Y'all being heard.
- All right.

438
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,693
There goes shorty, right there.

439
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,658
What's up, man? You know...

440
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:04,328
I'm a man of my word.
I said it would be $4,000 on Omar,

441
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:08,165
$2,000 on each of the young ones,
this being a team effort.

442
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,168
$500 in the boy hand
who doing the scope,

443
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:13,921
$500 in your hand
for doing the relay,

444
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:18,092
$500 in Wee-Bey hand, Bird hand
for doing the muscling up.

445
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,471
- All right.
- How you doing with that other thing?

446
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:24,515
What?

447
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,809
Everybody a little
depressed, right?

448
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,895
You know,
ain't no surprises yet.

449
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:35,401
Cut everybody loose on Friday and they all
just a bunch of begging-ass bitches.

450
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,486
Ain't nobody showed
no money since.

451
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:40,281
- You gonna keep it humming?
- You know.

452
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:43,284
You got your hands up.

453
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:47,454
Keep on doing like how you're doing,
we'll talk about points on the package.

454
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,748
All right?

455
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:52,668
- Keep it humming.
- Most def.

456
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,757
- All right then.
- Take it light, but take it.

457
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,642
Hotter than the Wu-Tang,
killer bees, killer bees.

458
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,711
- 40 cents.
- Not 40 cents a foot, no sir.

459
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,880
Look, respectfully,
I gotta tell you,

460
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:41,592
for 40 cents a foot, you might as well
go to Home Depot, pay them.

461
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,845
They're gonna charge you
45 or 50 cents a foot.

462
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,889
For copper that isn't stolen.

463
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,851
Look. All right. 35 cents a foot.

464
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:54,104
And that's in respect I have for
what you're doing in our community

465
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,690
with these quality domiciles here.

466
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,319
30 cents a foot,
take it or leave it.

467
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,702
I understand the interest
in clearing these cases, I do.

468
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:14,166
But charging those murders now and putting
information we have into the documents...

469
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:17,044
I just call them
like I see them, Lieutenant.

470
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:21,590
Three murders, same gun, we got this
Barksdale kid right at the scene on the one.

471
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:25,344
We're up on the wire.
We're starting to pull good information.

472
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,973
You charge these prematurely
and Barksdale will change up on us.

473
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,225
- The work we've done...
- Look.

474
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:34,853
I can't tell you how to run your case,
I can only run my own.

475
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:36,105
Major...

476
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:41,151
I'm asking as a favor.

477
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:45,489
- As a favor.
- Yes, sir. A favor.

478
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,741
In that case...

479
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:51,578
No. Sorry.

480
00:38:56,835 --> 00:39:00,671
- You got home from work early today.
- Yep. Work sucks.

481
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,717
- Are we eating dinner with you?
- Why not?

482
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:10,014
- You promised we'd eat lasagna.
- So we'll go to Little Italy.

483
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:12,057
Get some lasagna at Sab's.

484
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:14,977
- You never cook.
- Cooking sucks too.

485
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,748
- Who's this?
- Yo, I wanna see him.

486
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,209
- Who?
- Brandon, my boy.

487
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,811
- Copper house, yo.
- Was the shit.

488
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:01,482
My plan, Bubbs.

489
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,068
Johnny had a plan.

490
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,529
Get out the way, motherfuckers.

491
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:10,157
This here is White Boy Day.

492
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,495
- I got a plan too.
- What?

493
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:19,458
We're gonna wait for that cheap-ass,
speculating motherfucker

494
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:24,213
to put that good copper line
back into them row houses he fixing up.

495
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:28,092
Then, before the drywall get up...

496
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:33,180
we creep back in there
and steal that shit right back.

497
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,683
30 cents a foot.

498
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:40,145
Gotta come back at a motherfucker
for that, you know?

499
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,940
Yeah.

500
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:47,486
You good?

501
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:50,864
I could top off with one more.

502
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,699
Just one more.

503
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,375
Johnny got it.

504
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:04,336
I'll be back.

505
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,488
It's my night with the kids.

506
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,840
You ain't gonna find nothing
because I didn't do nothing!

507
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,259
Why don't you just leave
me alone, man?

508
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:56,013
A white man can't walk down the street?
What's that about? Come on!

509
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,474
It's messed up, all right?

510
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:04,855
Profiling! What? It's 'cause I'm white, right?
Why don't you let me...

511
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,483
Man, what the fuck's that?
What's that?

512
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:13,989
That boy ain't got no luck.

513
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,046
All right. Hold up!

514
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,641
- Hey.
- Hey.

515
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:46,313
So, what are you going to do
with your money?

516
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:51,818
You know what you should do? Take the
roll and do something nice for your girl.

517
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,029
You do have a girl, right?

518
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:59,534
Anyway, you've got enough money
to go get yourself one now.

519
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,123
Why'd you punk Sterling
like you did?

520
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,709
I mean,
he did get shot behind this shit.

521
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:11,505
- I didn't punk him.
- So why are you dropping the lookout?

522
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,382
Cass too.

523
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:16,969
'Cause they was thieving.
Both of them.

524
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,304
They got pissed
'cause I wasn't paying them.

525
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:22,891
So Sterling started shaking up
the vials, handing off to Cass.

526
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:25,018
She was selling on the side.

527
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:30,691
You didn't tell anybody?
Stinkum, Bodie? They don't know?

528
00:43:30,984 --> 00:43:33,360
What you think they gonna do?

529
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:37,572
They gonna take a baseball bat
to Sterling, probably Cassandra too.

530
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:42,536
It's too much drama, right?
So, I just took them both off the stash.

531
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,205
So why didn't you pay us?

532
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:48,250
That wasn't right.

533
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,920
Listen, man.

534
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:54,381
Stringer thought we had a snitch
down here.

535
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:58,635
You know, with the jump-out,
Omar, all that shit.

536
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:02,014
So he told me to punk you all,

537
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:04,391
see who was holding money
at the end of the week.

538
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,435
Was they snitching?

539
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:08,020
Sterling and Cass?

540
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:10,939
No, man, just thieving.

541
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,658
All right, I'm with Homicide.

542
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:25,579
OK, you two, you sit right here, OK?
Don't wander off.

543
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,583
- Dad?
- What?

544
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:32,336
It's a school night.
Mom said we had to...

545
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,297
I know, I know. We will.
Just stay there.

546
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:39,152
64-Charlie to Central K.

547
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,574
You up to this?

548
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:49,371
Pay it back, Omar.
Pay it back.

549
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:21,611
Why ain't we in a real
police office?

550
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:26,366
We're a little like you. Out here on
our own, playing the game for ourselves.

551
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:34,040
Hard way to go sometimes.

552
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:40,255
Sorry about your friend.

553
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,717
Avon is one sick bastard.

554
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,636
Of course, he had his reasons.

555
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:51,558
- For one thing, you did take his stash.
- For another, he's looking for you, Omar.

556
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,227
That's what all the burns
were about.

557
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:57,063
Broken fingers, cracked forearms.

558
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,692
He wanted your boy
to give you up.

559
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,652
An address, a street.

560
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,447
Kid had heart.

561
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,574
Yeah.

562
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:12,162
I know you want to go to
wherever it is you lay your head

563
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,665
and pick up that sawed-off you like
so much and go on the hunt.

564
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:18,627
That's how a man like you
wants to carry it.

565
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:21,338
- You wouldn't be wrong.
- No, you wouldn't.

566
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:24,174
But one man with two barrels
ain't enough, Omar.

567
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:27,010
You're gonna do
what you're gonna do.

568
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:30,847
But whatever else you can give us
on Barksdale and his people,

569
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,558
that can go to
hurting him too.

570
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,269
Just throw us what you can.

571
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:39,523
Let me tell you all
something, all right?

572
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,110
What I do, I do,
straight like that.

573
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:49,616
Ain't no sense in you all troubling yourselves
'cause the way I feel right now, today...

574
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,626
What do you all need from me?

575
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:04,047
When did you last see Brandon?

576
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:08,009
Tuesday around 7:00.
Maybe later.

577
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:13,014
He was on his way down to Mindamin
and the Greek's after that.

578
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:15,559
He got snatched up from there.

579
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,310
On Baltimore Street?

580
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,438
He liked to play them pinball
games to death.

581
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:22,566
He go alone?

582
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,318
And I didn't like it
none neither.

583
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:30,907
But you can only treat a young man
like a boy for so long before they buck.

584
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:34,911
When Bailey got killed, you must have figured
Barksdale was coming back on you?

585
00:48:34,996 --> 00:48:36,621
Bailey? Please.

586
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,832
That nigger's enemies got enemies.

587
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:42,669
I just figured he tried his hand
on the wrong corner and got dropped.

588
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:45,589
But you were worried
about Brandon, right?

589
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:50,135
Look, in my game, you take some kid,
you play it the safest way you can.

590
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:52,762
But it ain't about
no hiding forever.

591
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,431
You heard?

592
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:58,643
Frankly, you been in it as long as me,
you do the thing on your name.

593
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:02,147
Anyone going to come after Omar,
they know Omar's coming after him.

594
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:04,024
Oh, indeed.

595
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,860
So, who came after Brandon?

596
00:49:07,737 --> 00:49:09,779
I heard it might have
been Wee-Bey,

597
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,532
boy Stinkum,

598
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:14,242
and Bird.

599
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,536
He was down with the snatch too.

600
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,211
So, what can you give us
on the job?

601
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:30,925
7:56 Tuesday night, you had
an incoming call to Barksdale's,

602
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:32,677
giving him the number
of a pay phone.

603
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:35,847
Westside exchange.
Number's encoded, right?

604
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:41,061
Three minutes later, we get another call
from the low-rises to that number.

605
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,980
A half-minute later,
another call from the low-rises

606
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:46,024
to a pager we know
is Stringer Bell's.

607
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:49,903
- I'll be damned.
- Finally, we get another call.

608
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:53,490
Probably from a pay phone.
Probably Stringer Bell calling back.

609
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:55,825
Coming on into the low-rise courts.

610
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,329
45 minutes later, another call.

611
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:03,833
This one from the same pay phone
that went to D'Angelo's pager

612
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,919
to start the whole thing off.

613
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,170
This is the murder here.

614
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:11,007
This first number,
the one they sent to D'Angelo.

615
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:14,594
I'm thinking this comes from
a pay phone over by the Greek's.

616
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:27,607
He's on you. We're up on those
pay phones, we catch that murder.

617
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,317
We get there before the murder.

618
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:33,822
It's all here on the pen register. This one
calling that one, that one calling back.

619
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:37,283
We're up on those pay phones,
and we have him cold.

620
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:42,455
But we're not up in time, are we? In this case,
we're never where we need to be.

621
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:55,593
Bad time for you all?

622
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:14,362
- He fight, but you arrest.
- You saw him get arrested?

623
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:17,240
- On Tuesday?
- Tuesday, yes. Tuesday.

624
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:20,034
By the police?
The police arrested him?

625
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,829
Cops, they handcuffed him?

626
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,209
What about these guys?
Were they there with him?

627
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:29,961
No.

628
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:36,301
- He fight, you arrest.
- Right.

629
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,345
Okay, thank you, sir.
Thank you.

630
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:48,646
It's a match.

631
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:51,608
No.

632
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,277
I need help. Rawls ranks me.

633
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:57,655
Lieutenant,
think what you're doing here.

634
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:03,203
You're gonna cross Bill Rawls, as ruthless
a fuck as we have in this department?

635
00:52:04,914 --> 00:52:06,623
And to do what?

636
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:10,710
To fight for a case the Deputy of Operations
doesn't even want.

637
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:14,339
No.

638
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:17,842
I like my career,
thank you very much.

639
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:24,933
In the cemetery, you were telling us
a guy named Bird killed the working man.

640
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,353
The man who testified.

641
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,480
William Gant. Right.

642
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:33,107
Bird did that one, for sure.

643
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:35,568
- How do you know?
- Everybody know, man.

644
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:40,990
Nigger walked up and shot him in the head.
The whole project saw that much.

645
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,034
And Bird worked for Avon?

646
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,911
As one of his shooters.

647
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:49,999
Liked to use this real sweet gun. A .380 from
Austria or Australia. Something like that.

648
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:52,252
But I know he loved that gun.

649
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:53,378
A .380.

650
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,922
A .380. You get him,
you get the gun.

651
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,675
'Cause Bird's too dumb
to throw a gun like that off.

652
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,803
- A gun alone ain't enough.
- Oh, no?

653
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,806
He bought the gun on the street
after Gant was killed.

654
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,851
- What would be enough then?
- Eyeball witness.

655
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,354
Some kind of corroboration
for what you're telling me here.

656
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:17,235
- Okay.
- Okay, what?

657
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:20,363
- I'm your man.
- You saw the murder?

658
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,115
Yeah.

659
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:26,160
You can ID this man Bird
as the shooter of William Gant?

660
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:31,165
And you ain't afraid to go into court and
testify against one of Barksdale's people?

661
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,378
Omar don't scare.

662
00:53:37,882 --> 00:53:41,467
While Daniels and his merry band
are lost in the swamps

663
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:44,929
playing with beepers and pay phones
and body mics,

664
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:48,433
my people have developed information
that ties Barksdale to three killings.

665
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:52,186
- D'Angelo Barksdale, not Avon.
- On behalf of Avon.

666
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:57,400
The victim is identified by our witnesses
as being involved with Avon Barksdale.

667
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:01,487
- Sir, we're developing...
- You're dancing around this thing.

668
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:06,659
- I'm charging three murders.
- You charge them, my investigation folds.

669
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:10,330
Not one of those cases
is strong enough for court.

670
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:15,501
We bring the kid in, throw a mindfuck at him
and the case becomes stronger.

671
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:19,505
You've had him twice before.
He's gonna go for less the third time.

672
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:22,842
So we re-canvass,
develop fresh witnesses.

673
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:27,430
The case I charge on today
can be twice as strong by the trial date.

674
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:32,602
We get a conviction. We roll
Little Boy Barksdale into Big Boy Barksdale,

675
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:38,358
then we go home like good old-fashioned
cops and pound some Budweiser.

676
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:43,279
This is bullshit!

677
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:48,826
McNulty made the ballistics match on
these murders and he's telling me fight this.

678
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:52,914
He knows you don't have
a viable prosecution, so do you, so do I.

679
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:54,540
Enough.

680
00:54:58,212 --> 00:55:01,047
Look, I've got no love
for your wiretap, Lieutenant.

681
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:06,135
I'm spending $2,000 a day over
the unit operating budget to staff the case.

682
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:12,266
Major Rawls is offering a chance to leverage
Barksdale through a murder prosecution.

683
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,727
Why not jump on this?

684
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:21,693
Because if Major Rawls is right
then he will be right a month from now.

685
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:26,030
If the wire doesn't give us a case,
he can charge all the murders he has.

686
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:28,032
We lose nothing.

687
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,909
But if he's wrong,

688
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,246
if he can't convict,
or if the Barksdale kid doesn't flip,

689
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,832
then it's too late to do anything else.

690
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:40,962
Avon Barksdale changes up his pattern,
and the wiretap dies.

691
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:45,633
At that point, there isn't gonna be a thing
that you, or me, or Rawls here

692
00:55:45,718 --> 00:55:48,928
is gonna be able to say
to that goddamn judge.

693
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,438
You wanted to see me, Major?

694
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:02,150
McNulty does personal business
on the clock, I wanna know.

695
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:04,777
He cheats on a run sheet,
I wanna know.

696
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:07,363
He runs any kind of game at all,
I wanna know.

697
00:56:07,448 --> 00:56:10,158
Major, the man's an asshole,

698
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:15,038
but he doesn't do much other than work.
He's got this case in his gut like it's cancer.

699
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:19,292
He does no wrong?
Doesn't drink any more?

700
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:22,420
Doesn't drink on duty?
Doesn't drink and drive, Detective?

701
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:26,424
- Major...
- You've got to help me on this, Michael.

702
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,156
The murder warrant's on hold.

703
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:53,826
The Deputy gave us another month.

704
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,413
Also, whoever that was
you brought in today

705
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:00,166
gave himself up
as an eyewitness to the Gant murder.

706
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,293
Who? Omar?

707
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:05,421
Greggs said to tell you
she'd write it up in the morning.

708
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:09,175
Lieutenant...

709
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:11,511
Thanks.

710
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,186
It cost you?
