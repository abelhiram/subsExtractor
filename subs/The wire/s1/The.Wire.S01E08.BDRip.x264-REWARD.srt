1
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,595
Number, 18.

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,305
Conine.

3
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,307
I knew that one.

4
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:18,935
Alright, this one's for Mikey.

5
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,230
- Can I help you?
- One lemonade, please.

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,942
- You ready? Number six.
- I know it.

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,610
Sean, shush.

8
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,572
- David Segui?
- Melvin Mora, numbnuts.

9
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,826
I thought Mora was number nine.

10
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:38,371
Listen, guys, we're gonna play that spy
game. Do you remember the spy game?

11
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:41,416
- Who's it?
- That tall black guy over there.

12
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:44,544
You're supposed to say
African-American, Dad.

13
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,839
- African-American.
- I'm the front, you're the follow.

14
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:50,967
- I was the follow last time.
- Don't argue, go on. Go.

15
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,867
Come on!

16
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:42,912
I got him.

17
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,141
They're both brown hair, one that big,
the other about that big.

18
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,769
He's wearing... I don't know
what the fuck he's wearing.

19
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:15,611
Will Michael and Sean McNulty please report
to the offices at the rear of the market?

20
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,155
Michael and Sean McNulty.

21
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,157
Please report.

22
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,129
<i>If you walk through the garden</i>

23
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,965
<i>You better watch your back</i>

24
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:40,928
<i>Well, I beg your pardon</i>

25
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,973
<i>Walk the straight
and narrow track</i>

26
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,435
<i>If you walk with Jesus</i>

27
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,480
<i>He'll save your soul</i>

28
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,610
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

29
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:59,196
<i>Down in the hole</i>

30
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,034
<i>All the angels sing</i>

31
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,829
<i>About Jesus' mighty sword</i>

32
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,875
<i>And they shield you
with their wings</i>

33
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:15,171
<i>Keep you close to the Lord</i>

34
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:18,049
<i>Don't pay heed to temptation</i>

35
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:22,845
<i>For his hands are so cold</i>

36
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,223
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

37
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:30,519
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

38
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,404
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

39
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,200
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

40
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:49,205
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

41
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:52,208
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

42
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,300
One payphone goes down,
don't mean shit.

43
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,470
Both at the same time,
that's a plan.

44
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,264
- We spooked them.
- Busting the runner?

45
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,892
Maybe it's that,
maybe something else.

46
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,769
We still got the tower phones.

47
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,313
And we're up on
Stringer Bell's pager now too.

48
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:17,191
Yeah, but this is showing us just
how cautious these guys are.

49
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,986
We make any kind of play
and they're ready to change up on us.

50
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,073
If they're not using the payphones
in the low-rises, then what are they doing?

51
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,242
They're walking to
another payphone.

52
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,996
We might see more traffic
on the tower payphones.

53
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,043
Sergeants' test's tomorrow, right?

54
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,713
Four in the afternoon.

55
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,632
You ain't gonna take it
this time?

56
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,009
Sure, why not?

57
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,805
- You ain't gonna study?
- Sure I am.

58
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,059
You guys need to follow
some of the boys out of the Pit

59
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:54,311
and see what they're using
for payphones.

60
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,442
- Excuse me, is that a direct order?
- I'm just saying...

61
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,944
If you wanna follow these assholes
from phone to phone,

62
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,362
why don't you do it yourself?

63
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,865
I'm in-office, remember?

64
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,785
- Right, they took your gun.
- For shooting your car.

65
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:13,622
- No, that was before.
- That's right, that was something else.

66
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,790
Right.

67
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,299
You believe this guy? Like there are
fucking stripes on his sleeve.

68
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,302
You guys need to get up
on those rooftops today.

69
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,305
See what these mopes are using
for phones.

70
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,494
Look at this shit.

71
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,120
What the fuck is that?

72
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,873
- Let me look at that shit.
- Bird told me that shit. Look at that.

73
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,876
Fucking peter-puffer,
get the fuck out of here.

74
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,852
Mr. Omar,
you want ends on this?

75
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,731
No, darling, I'm cool.

76
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,373
- Nice shirt.
- Fuck you.

77
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,668
Takes guts wearing a pink shirt
on the BPD Homicide unit.

78
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,169
Yes, it does.

79
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:46,674
Guts, or a familiarity
with alternative lifestyles.

80
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:51,053
- What are you chasing?
- Toyota Camry.

81
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:52,555
Whose?

82
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,432
It's listed to some woman
with a county address.

83
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:59,311
- Saturday, my man, Stringer Bell was using it.
- You were working the weekend?

84
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:02,022
No, I'm down in the Northeast market
with the kids, right?

85
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:05,401
- Who should appear before me?
- Market day for String too?

86
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,194
I know he makes me
if I get too close,

87
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,572
so I put Sean and Michael on him,
front and follow.

88
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:13,242
They're so fucking good, I lose track of them,
scared the shit out of myself.

89
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,828
But they stay with him,
spec the Camry,

90
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,455
and Sean, my flesh and blood,
gets the tag.

91
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,499
Your kids know front-and-follow?

92
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,794
They fucking love it.
We play spy in the mall sometimes.

93
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,382
Anyhow, I got a Woodmore address of a
woman who lends her wheels to Stringer Bell.

94
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:33,429
- It's a start.
- The fucking family McNulty. Jesus.

95
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,057
What?

96
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,229
Wallace. Wallace.

97
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,939
Yo, Wallace.

98
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,401
- What?
- Yo, Wallace.

99
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,820
- What?
- What's this about here?

100
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,119
This one here?

101
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,707
A bus traveling on Central Avenue begins
it's route by picking up eight passengers.

102
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:06,670
Next, it picks up four more, and then
an additional two, while discharging one.

103
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:10,799
At the next-to-last stop, three passengers
get off the bus and two get on.

104
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,928
How many passengers
are on the bus at the last stop?

105
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,263
Just do it in your head.

106
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,270
Yo, testers coming out today.
New package.

107
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:27,191
- I might be down later.
- Later?

108
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,443
Look, I'll catch you around
the way, alright?

109
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:34,615
Wallace, man,
you can't just lay up in here.

110
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,576
- Seven, right?
- D been asking about shit.

111
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:40,120
- So what?
- I been telling him you sick.

112
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,873
He ain't gonna let me
carry that too much longer.

113
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,501
I be down later sometime.

114
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:49,838
- Testers gonna be out.
- Look, man, fuck the testers.

115
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,299
Fuck the testers, fuck D,
fuck all that shit.

116
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:56,679
Just let me hold $10 and
I'll give it back to you by Friday.

117
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,723
How? D ain't gonna pay you
for not working.

118
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,767
Look, you gonna let me hold
ten or not?

119
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,360
- Eight?
- Damn, Sarah. Close your eyes.

120
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,154
You working a ground stash.
20 tall pinks.

121
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:17,324
Two fiends ask for two each.
Another one cops three.

122
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:22,037
Bodie hands you ten more, but a white guy
rolls up, waves you down, and pays for eight.

123
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:25,624
- How many vials you got left?
- 15.

124
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,044
How the fuck can you keep the count right
but not do the book problem?

125
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,880
Count be wrong,
they'll fuck you up.

126
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,512
- He coming to you.
- Today?

127
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,473
- He in a rush or something?
- We told him to do it like that.

128
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:45,436
He had his hand out last night
and we told him first thing today.

129
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,397
- He ain't coming into the tower?
- No, not like that.

130
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,734
Just run 20 on down to him.
He gonna roll on his way.

131
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,737
- Be there in an hour, maybe.
- Who gonna know?

132
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,072
Little Man, he know Day.

133
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,742
That was Stringer Bell?

134
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,662
Calling down to tower payphone number one,
after taking a page 15 minutes ago.

135
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,291
- We know Little Man?
- Enforcer in the 221 building.

136
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:12,338
So he's rolling out of the 221
in about a half an hour or so

137
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,257
with 20 whatevers to hand off
to someone named Day.

138
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,928
Product coming out of the towers.
We're usually trying to catch it going in.

139
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,473
If you wanna catch them,
we're gonna have to hustle.

140
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,270
Wallace, man, he bugging.

141
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,231
- Where he be at?
- Nowhere.

142
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:36,278
He just lays around all day.
Begged my ass off for sandwich money.

143
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,489
You worried about him?

144
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:43,452
Shit ain't right.
You might consult with him some.

145
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,747
What the fuck? If he don't wanna
be down here, that's on him.

146
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,626
Ain't like nobody holding
no gun to his head or nothing.

147
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,878
Yeah, but he ain't about
nothing else.

148
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,131
He up in his room and shit,
all the damn day.

149
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:02,054
- Tell Wallace to come see me.
- All right.

150
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,353
Be right back.

151
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,168
It's been two hours.

152
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,797
What if Little Man ain't working
in the 221 today?

153
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,010
What if this Day guy don't come?

154
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,933
What if he came already
and we just missed the pick-up?

155
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,519
Yo, Herc, what if your mother
and father never met?

156
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,236
- How's shop doing?
- Steady rolling.

157
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:03,866
- Let's take a ride. Beef run.
- Beef run, where at?

158
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,704
Pulaski, baby, the good shit.
Get in the car, man.

159
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,422
Yo, Poot.
You the man for an hour.

160
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,559
Shit, look at me.

161
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,753
- Kima.
- The Lincoln, we're on it.

162
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,431
Hang back.
Let's see where he goes.

163
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,778
I don't understand that,
never did.

164
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,281
Damn, Bey, how can you stand that shit
with all that hot shit on it?

165
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:31,245
Trick is not to give a fuck, boy.
I got this, you know me.

166
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,414
So what? My uncle just cut
y'all loose today?

167
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:38,627
No, we're celebrating. Stinkum got
some points for some fresh territory.

168
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,880
Yeah, I heard about that.
How much is yours in the package?

169
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,050
20. First we gotta run off
the niggers that been down there.

170
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:48,387
Ain't no thing.
Bunch of off-brand niggers is all.

171
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:52,057
You keep running that Pit the way you been,
you gonna see points too.

172
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,394
Yeah, well, you know.
Shit, I'm here waiting.

173
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,230
It'll come, right, Stink?

174
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,482
I been talking to Orlando.

175
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,652
He said he got this good coke connect
from New Orleans.

176
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,322
Orlando?

177
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,660
He want me to put what he can get out
into the court, a little extra on the side.

178
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,329
I don't know, D.
You better talk to your uncle about that.

179
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,081
Yeah, definitely.

180
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,294
I'm gonna see what he say on it.
Yeah.

181
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:25,132
- But today is your day, man. Stink day.
- It's his night too.

182
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,301
We gonna break out tonight, daddy.

183
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,887
Bring some of Orlando's good pussy
over there by Little Man's.

184
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,141
Yeah.

185
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,560
You up, D? You up?

186
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,938
- Yeah! He up.
- You up.

187
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,900
Nigger, I'm up!
You don't gotta ask twice.

188
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,573
What's wrong?

189
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:54,202
No, no, no, no.
He give a fuck now.

190
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,039
Water!

191
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,049
- Step out of the car, sir.
- What did I do?

192
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,967
Step out of the car.

193
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,930
Go around to my partner here.

194
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,935
- I'm already late.
- Put your hands on the roof, please, sir.

195
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,524
You were observed in one of the city's
designated drug-free, anti-loitering zones,

196
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:28,028
where a drug suspect leaned
into your vehicle, handing you something.

197
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,155
When we signalled for you to stop,

198
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:34,493
you leaned over as if concealing something
beneath the passenger seat.

199
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,411
Come on, enough of this shit.

200
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,081
- Is there something beneath that seat, sir?
- No.

201
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:44,628
- Then you don't mind if we look.
- Fuck y'all. This is some bullshit.

202
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:57,015
- That's none of your business.
- How about if I make it my business?

203
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:45,856
You rang?

204
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,528
- Who's he?
- Damien Lavell Price.

205
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,241
He takes 20,000 in cash
out of the 221 building.

206
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,618
Lester picked up the drop
from one of the tower phones.

207
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,079
We followed him till he knew
we were on him.

208
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:04,082
- He's a legislative aide?
- Who paged me?

209
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,627
He's in your office.

210
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,422
We popped him
with $20,000 in cash.

211
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,216
- What kind of PC?
- Right off the wire.

212
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:17,846
Stringer Bell to someone on a tower phone.
We thought we'd come up with drugs.

213
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:21,016
- Got money instead.
- I know this guy.

214
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:30,442
Orioles won last night.
Bullpen stood up to Boston.

215
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,946
You get that money
cracking cribs, or what?

216
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,449
I'd like to speak to my attorney.

217
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,751
He was driving for one of the politicians
at this fundraiser I got dragged to.

218
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,961
- Which one?
- Someone from Annapolis.

219
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,838
From the looks of his ID, anyway.

220
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:54,424
- What do we charge here?
- He say the money's his?

221
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:55,926
He don't say shit.

222
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,180
Keep the cash.
Write him a receipt.

223
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,225
He wants to put a claim in
with the city solicitor, he can.

224
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,727
But they're gonna ask him
where he got the pile.

225
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:09,272
The angel of death.

226
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,568
- Who's that?
- Major Reed, IID.

227
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:21,868
Lieutenant, a word.

228
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,422
What's up?

229
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,094
- How you doing?
- Me?

230
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,848
Yeah, you.
Everything is good?

231
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,517
I'm all right.

232
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:49,479
I mean, you fixed for cash
or something, man?

233
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:54,442
'Cause... 200...
If you need a little something,

234
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,947
really, the thing to do is just
to ask for it.

235
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,410
All I do is put money in your pocket
and make sure you don't stray from the nest!

236
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:06,621
Sit down.
The last motherfucking thing I need

237
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,416
is for the clean name
on my liquor license

238
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,043
to be dirtied the fuck up by you.
You understand that, right?

239
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:15,422
Avon, come on, man.
Come on, Avon.

240
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,562
Motherfucker.

241
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,814
Do your fucking job!

242
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,412
I checked with
the state Personnel Department.

243
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,791
He's on the payroll of Senator Davis's
district office for more than a year.

244
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,296
He did four years in Hagerstown
for daytime B and E.

245
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,507
Before that, drug charges
and a PBJ on a check charge.

246
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:04,346
Now we catch him coming out of the towers
with 20 grand in manicured, banded money.

247
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:08,141
You brought him in here
on what charge?

248
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,352
Civil forfeiture.

249
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:14,397
Until he tells us a legitimate source
for that money, we keep it.

250
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,692
So you have no criminal charge.

251
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,195
No, just the money.

252
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,159
Give it back.

253
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,289
- Sir?
- Give the man back his money.

254
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:33,249
Sir, we pulled this off the wire,

255
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,753
with one of our suspects telling
another to expect a pick-up.

256
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,965
- It's drug money in that car.
- Give him back his money.

257
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,468
Write it up as an unwarranted
car stop.

258
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:50,433
I ask you to put a charge on a drug dealer,
Lieutenant. That's all I ask.

259
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,313
Now I got wiretaps, pager clones,
affidavits coming out of my ass.

260
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:59,609
And you? You're in people's shit
where you're not supposed to be.

261
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,612
- Sir...
- I'm shutting this down, Lieutenant.

262
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:06,866
You charge what you can
and you do it by the end of the week.

263
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:11,204
- We did nothing wrong.
- You jacked up a senatorial aide.

264
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:15,083
You went into his pocket,
pulled out $20,000.

265
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:19,045
And though there's no criminal charge,
you think it wise to try to keep it.

266
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:24,592
You shit all over yourself,
all over me, all over this department.

267
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:30,765
I told you,
no surprises, remember?

268
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,816
20 even.

269
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:44,070
Sign here, or you can count it
yourself if you want.

270
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,197
So I can leave now?

271
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,629
Will somebody please tell me
what the fuck that was about?

272
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:11,181
This is bullshit. We just gave back
20 large of Barksdale's money.

273
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:19,564
Hey!

274
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:25,487
What the fuck? Let me guess, the deputy?
How's he got onto this so quick?

275
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,323
- I told him.
- Why would you be telling him?

276
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:32,494
He's the deputy for operations
and I jacked up an aide to a state senator.

277
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:36,831
- How do I not tell him?
- There's been no complaint from the senator.

278
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:41,503
Know why? What is his driver doing coming
out of the high-rises with so much money?

279
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,090
- That's what I told the deputy.
- He said we're to mind our own business?

280
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:48,301
- Give back his money and go away?
- Pretty much.

281
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,387
Except he said a few things
for my benefit too.

282
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,515
Like how I had shit all over him.

283
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,642
Like how he was shutting us
down this week.

284
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:58,186
- The fuck he is.
- We're done.

285
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,106
I go past Friday and I'm buried.
He told me that.

286
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,109
He's gonna bury you? For what?
You're doing your fucking job.

287
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:08,238
You think the job is gonna save me?
You think it's gonna save you?

288
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,491
Chain of command, detective.
That's all I got from the deputy.

289
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,409
Chain of command?

290
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,371
Did you tell your major about
the senator's driver? Or the colonel?

291
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,540
No?
Then where's your chain of command?

292
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,919
What's the shift lieutenant doing
going up the back stairs to the deputy ops?

293
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,216
- What are you saying?
- Nothing.

294
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,719
Goddamn right.

295
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,056
Why, he got something on you?

296
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,351
You say you got the deputy's ear.
What the fuck's he got on you?

297
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,895
Only rank, Detective.

298
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:35,575
Yo, Stink.
What about the rules, yo?

299
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,786
Special occasion, yo.

300
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,759
Yo, Bey.

301
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,808
- I'm gonna throw up.
- No, you ain't.

302
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:42,392
- Burrell thinks I crossed him.
- He said this to you?

303
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,936
In so many words.

304
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,147
- You need to explain...
- Explain what?

305
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:50,608
That I'm bringing in a case
that goes everywhere?

306
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:56,948
Today it was some senator's driver. Two days
from now, a city councilman, maybe.

307
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:00,868
He asked for a charge on Barksdale.
That's all he asked for.

308
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,830
This thing with the legislative aide,
who could've foreseen it?

309
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:06,541
He saw it. Burrell.

310
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,796
See, this is the thing
that everyone knows and no one says.

311
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,549
You follow the drugs,
you get a drug case.

312
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,969
You start following the money,
you don't know where you're going.

313
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:21,639
They don't want wiretaps or wired CIs
or anything else they can't control.

314
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,143
Because once that tape starts rolling,
who knows what's gonna be said?

315
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:32,775
That son of a bitch McNulty asked me
what the deputy had on me.

316
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,278
He actually asked me that.

317
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,697
What did you say?

318
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:05,183
Yo, where everybody go?
Where the girls go?

319
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:10,480
- Fuck it, man. Party broke.
- We drunked out and fucked out.

320
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:14,609
You all send me out for liquor,
and by the time I get back, the shit is dead?

321
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:19,822
Look at this. The Knicks done
fucked up they draft again.

322
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,328
Yo, what's with her?

323
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,624
Fucked her silly.
What can I say?

324
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:37,632
She snorted half the shit we brought up
in here too, that greedy bitch.

325
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:56,984
Yo, Bey.

326
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:03,324
Back-up center of good quality
is very important to the Wizards.

327
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,077
What they've got is doing
fairly well right now,

328
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:12,500
but players can't play 82 games
and expect to sharp every single night.

329
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:22,760
- You wanted to see us?
- What the hell is this?

330
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,720
I got copied this morning.

331
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,307
It's just what it looks like.

332
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,603
A memo signed by the deputy ops,
Rawls and Forester, telling us to pack it in.

333
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:37,817
We come down on the wire by Friday,
ship the computers to the DEA by Monday

334
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,403
and charge whoever we have
by the end of next week.

335
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,780
Yeah? Who do you have?

336
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:46,784
Two mid-level guys.
Anton Artis a.k.a. Stinkum.

337
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:49,412
Shooter named Bird,
wanted for killing Gant.

338
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,165
- He was a witness in your court.
- That's it?

339
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:57,044
- Except for a couple of hangers-on, yeah.
- Why are they doing this? Why now?

340
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,964
We picked up a bag man
coming out of the high-rises

341
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,008
carrying 20 grand in cash
yesterday.

342
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,469
- So?
- So he works for Clay Davis.

343
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:07,138
Of the 39th Legislative District.

344
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,558
- The deputy was displeased.
- It's OK though.

345
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:13,019
We gave the money back,
said we were sorry.

346
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,980
- What can Daniels do?
- Not a fucking thing.

347
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:20,526
The deputy sent him the same direct order
you have on your desk right there.

348
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:22,778
Get me Burrell on the line!

349
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:27,366
Detectives, when you swore
that your affidavit was true,

350
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:31,871
to the best of your ability,
what did the Circuit Court of Baltimore do?

351
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:36,042
- You gave us the wire.
- For how long, Detective McNulty?

352
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,877
60 days, no?

353
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,922
And how long have you monitored
these phone extensions?

354
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,550
- 40 days, maybe.
- Deputy Burrell is on the line.

355
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,180
Erv, it's Phelan.

356
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:52,099
Kiddo, you're fucking
with me here.

357
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:55,144
Yes. Yes, you are.

358
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,272
Erv, listen, listen to me.

359
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,150
The Circuit Court signed two orders

360
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,903
for a total of 60 days
of telephonic surveillance.

361
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:07,031
Now, I'm looking at a copy of a memo
from your office

362
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,534
telling me I can't have
my 60 days.

363
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,537
You're not hearing me.

364
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:17,792
The Circuit Court for Baltimore
ordered 60 days on this tap.

365
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,628
The Court wants its 60 days.

366
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:25,341
If you take this wire down on Friday,
you'll be in contempt of court on Monday.

367
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,760
Understood?

368
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:31,389
And all the best to
Arlene and the kids.

369
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,558
Yeah.

370
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,565
Who's your daddy now?

371
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:58,249
Look, I didn't do a damn thing, Lieutenant.
You got a beef, it's with the judge.

372
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,586
Yeah, he got the deputy's memo,
he called his own shot.

373
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,298
Well, ask Greggs
if you don't believe me.

374
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,594
Look, I've got to go.

375
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,039
Kima!

376
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,089
Deputy called, mad as the devil.

377
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:50,092
Tell them to quit packing.
We're back up on the wire.

378
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:52,470
Kima.

379
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,931
McNulty or the judge?
Or both?

380
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,017
This time the judge.

381
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:11,405
- Ask me a question. Any question.
- I thought you weren't gonna study.

382
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:15,910
This job is common sense.
Ask me a question, dickless. See how I do.

383
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:19,597
According to Q1...

384
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:23,250
Hold up, help me out here.
You have to know them by the numbers?

385
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,713
It helps. Makes it sound
more professional that way.

386
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:33,094
According to Q1, the general order
covering sexual harassment,

387
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:36,263
in the event a female officer
in your squad complains

388
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,600
that her side partner has sexually
harassed her, you should...

389
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:43,104
A, notify the commanding officer.

390
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:46,190
B, notify the shift lieutenant.

391
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:50,611
Or C, notify the ranking
female officer.

392
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:52,780
I go with D.

393
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:55,741
D?

394
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,161
Bitch-slap the side partner
for dipping into my private stock,

395
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,997
then take missy home
and fuck her till she smiles.

396
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,642
What the hell?

397
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:58,137
When a small change in price
creates a large change in demand,

398
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:03,058
then demand is said to be elastic,
but some products are inelastic,

399
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:06,145
meaning, a change in price
does not affect demand.

400
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:10,691
Some key factors that affect
the elasticity of demand are what?

401
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:14,862
- Mr. Bell?
- Desire. Consumer need.

402
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:21,202
Right, specifically, the ability of a consumer
to delay acquisition. What else?

403
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,196
My pencil lost its point.

404
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:59,156
All the girls say so.

405
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:06,372
Damon, we got work orders here,
and ain't nothing happening.

406
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:09,500
These were due yesterday and
people are gonna be coming in here

407
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,086
asking for their work
and nothing been done.

408
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,797
Fuck 'em. Let 'em wait.

409
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:19,134
You're not gonna bring that corner
bullshit up in here. You hear me?

410
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:25,099
What we got here is an elastic product.
You know what that mean?

411
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:30,604
When people can go elsewhere and get they
printing and copying done, they gonna do it.

412
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,774
You acting like we got
an inelastic product and we don't.

413
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:38,070
I want this to run like
a true fucking business.

414
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,449
Not no front, not no bullshit.

415
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:44,702
Understand me?

416
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,122
I'm serious.

417
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:55,254
- Where you snatch this old wreck from?
- Out Frederick Road.

418
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,548
Ditch it over Eastside
when we done.

419
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,846
Check it. Him there,
and that other fool there.

420
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,098
They the only ones might be trouble.

421
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,642
So, I'm gonna drop Scar.
You just drop that other motherfucker.

422
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:13,147
No, just Scar. His boy break,
we gonna let him.

423
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:17,401
- But if he raise up, I'm on him.
- Damn, I wish Bird was here.

424
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,486
Bird be loving this shit
right here.

425
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,323
Which do remind me,
we get up out of here,

426
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,950
you need to drop that shit
down a storm drain.

427
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:30,497
Give me some time to go around the block
and set up on the other side. All right?

428
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,116
- Who got black tops?
- Black tops?

429
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,493
Over there.

430
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,331
Hey, now.

431
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:17,795
What the fuck?

432
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:57,084
Listen here, Bey. You come
at the king, you best not miss.

433
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,376
- Stink's been capped.
- Stink?

434
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:43,047
- Bey, too, in the leg.
- Shit, what happened?

435
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:46,592
- Down the gulley on Edmondson.
- Fucking Scar, man.

436
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:50,220
- It ain't him. Omar, man. Omar.
- Omar?

437
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:53,265
- Bounty's going up on that bitch.
- That fucks us.

438
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:57,603
We had Stinkum tied up from the arrest
of the runner and now he's out of the case.

439
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:00,147
The man's a fucking loose cannon.

440
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:03,776
- Literally.
- We've got to pull his ass up at least.

441
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,029
There's a dime on this
cocksucker's head.

442
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,656
One of you motherfuckers
need to step up.

443
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,827
- Where you go with that?
- Maryland General.

444
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,247
Walked up in there, told them I was
on the corner, caught a stray.

445
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,958
- Police come talk to you?
- Just a roller, no homicide.

446
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,920
Put it out there.
Not just our people, either.

447
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:26,882
I'm talking about any nigger who
wants to step up. Put out the word.

448
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,177
Ten on Omar or any motherfucker
standing with Omar.

449
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:34,681
Y'all niggers ain't got shit to do but
be on this motherfuckin' hunt. Be on it.

450
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,947
So, what do you think, homes?

451
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,742
I'm thinking, this is the worst
part of the game, man.

452
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:58,205
- Best we do is break out even, right?
- What?

453
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:02,709
I'm saying, this shit got personal.
Ain't nothing else to it.

454
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:08,632
- So, you talking about letting it slide.
- For a time, maybe.

455
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,553
I'm saying we put the word out
that you ready to talk a truce.

456
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:15,764
When this nigger come out
from underneath his rock, you hit him.

457
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,560
But right now?
This shit got out of hand.

458
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:50,507
What you want me to say?

459
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:56,597
I don't know nothing about Stink getting
dropped or Bey taking one in the leg.

460
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:01,768
- I don't know nothing about this nonsense.
- It came back to us quick.

461
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,770
You know how that be.

462
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,440
Everybody want to believe
the worst about Omar.

463
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,276
But live and let live, you know?

464
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,612
I don't see you letting them
slide on Brandon.

465
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,864
If I was coming after
certain people,

466
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:17,743
I definitely wouldn't want to give
y'all fine people any cause for concern.

467
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,746
- There are some rules here, right?
- Rules?

468
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:24,541
Yeah. No mistakes, no bystanders.

469
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:28,086
No taxpayers getting caught up
in the mix.

470
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:30,797
Just get in close and hit
the right nigger.

471
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,800
And lose the gun afterward,
that'd be a rule too, I think.

472
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:38,555
One thing, Omar. Having Stinkum dropped
kind of fucks us on our thing.

473
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,265
How so?

474
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,726
We had Stink with 4 G-packs
on a re-up.

475
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,979
We could've built something on that.
Roll him up with Stringer.

476
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,190
Now he's got no roll to him.

477
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:52,444
So, the point is, Omar, while we're all grateful
for the case you gave us on Bird,

478
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,239
and we all have a certain admiration your
do-it-yourself nature...

479
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:58,075
We need you to hang back.

480
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,578
Look, man, it ain't all
up to me, right?

481
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,624
I got a bounty on my head.

482
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:07,292
Yeah, we saw the van.

483
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:15,634
I do what I can do to help you all,
but the game is out there.

484
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,095
And it's either play
or get played.

485
00:43:23,977 --> 00:43:25,185
What, that it?

486
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,564
Gentlemen. Ma'am.

487
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,990
Lester, are we still cops?

488
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:42,577
- Technically, I suppose so.
- I was just checking.

489
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:46,039
Keisha ain't called
and she ain't been home.

490
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:48,959
How was she when you left her?

491
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,628
She was sick, I told you that.

492
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:55,924
She missed work last night and she ain't
been down there to pick up her check today.

493
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:01,888
You know something?

494
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:07,185
This game,
this thing with my uncle,

495
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:10,022
might not be right for me,
I'm thinking.

496
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,232
Why do you say that?

497
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,111
Nothing good to it
but the money.

498
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,905
Sounds a lot like my job.

499
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:23,327
You got people using each other.

500
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,622
Scamming each other.

501
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,962
Cutting each other up
because they late on a bill.

502
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:38,884
Shooting folks 'cause
there might be a fucking dollar in it.

503
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,431
It gets to sometime
like I can't even fucking breathe.

504
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:48,268
Like I can't even get no air.
You know what I mean?

505
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,230
Do something else.

506
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:58,195
- So, you happy with your job?
- Shit.

507
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:02,324
- Do something else.
- I am. I'm gonna have to. Shit.

508
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,911
Can't stay pretty forever.

509
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:15,670
It's not forever, right, D?

510
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,301
And then what?

511
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,972
You pretty now.

512
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:34,815
Now we pretty.

513
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,851
You got me, holler back.

514
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:16,648
D, man. Raise up and roll in quick.
Stink been got, man.

515
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,942
You hear me? They got Stink.

516
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,954
I need your help. Who caught the one
from Edmondson last night? Anton Artis.

517
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:34,124
Cole, with an assist from Dunnigan.

518
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,631
Omar was the shooter.

519
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,300
Fuck me.

520
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:45,260
It's all over the wiretap.

521
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:51,600
We put down one murder
on the testimony of one eyewitness

522
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:53,268
who then goes out
and drops somebody else.

523
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,979
It was payback for his
boyfriend, Brandon.

524
00:46:56,564 --> 00:47:00,066
Anton Artis is Stinkum, one of the boys
who snatched Brandon and did him up.

525
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:02,360
I'm sure that motherfucker had his reasons,
Jimmy, but, shit...

526
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:05,906
You wanna give back the Gant case,
tell Cole the name of his shooter.

527
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:08,867
Otherwise, tell him
we're getting talk on the wire

528
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:12,078
and we'll give him his clearance
once we wrap our case.

529
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:15,832
But you won't.

530
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,211
No, we won't.

531
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,881
You want me to go and bullshit Cole
out of his case for you?

532
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:25,050
- Go and tell him yourself.
- You kidding?

533
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:29,638
If Rawls sees my fingerprints on this,
he'll run my nuts through a cheese grater.

534
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,478
Fuck you, Jimmy.

535
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:43,527
- How's it going with it?
- Pretty good.

536
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:46,571
I like this kid who's fucking
my victim's old girlfriend.

537
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:50,158
Ray, can I talk to you
for a minute?

538
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,247
In my office.

539
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:13,056
With cases like this one, you get
put in some strange fucking places.

540
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:16,518
Cole's doing good this year.
He don't need the clearance.

541
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,397
I know this kind of fucks him.

542
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:25,110
You should've seen his face when I told him
you'd give him his shooter down the road.

543
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,654
He was happy, huh?

544
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:33,076
Yeah. He looked at me
like a damn puppy.

545
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:37,163
- I'm sorry, Bunk.
- I'll carry it.

546
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,082
Fuck it.

547
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:46,172
Tonight's mine.

548
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,261
I tell you what,
I'm gonna roll out.

549
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,098
Here's the money I would've
spent on your ass.

550
00:48:59,729 --> 00:49:01,187
Hey, Jimmy.

551
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,692
Call Nadine and tell her I caught one
and I'm out on the street.

552
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:15,535
I lied for you, didn't I?

553
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,049
- You got a minute?
- What's up?

554
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,554
I think I might have fucked
something up.

555
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,014
Yeah?

556
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:41,478
I'm interviewing Omar,
a few weeks back.

557
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:45,065
He's giving it to me that
Bird is the shooter in the Gant case.

558
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,485
He tells me if we catch up to Bird,
he'll have the gun on him.

559
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:50,528
Which he does.

560
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:55,033
But, the thing is I told him
that we needed an eyeball witness.

561
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:59,496
At which point, he volunteers.
Maybe he saw it.

562
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:02,499
Or maybe he put himself in it
just to see Bird locked up.

563
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:06,252
I got the impression
there wasn't much love between them.

564
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,424
I fucked up, didn't I?

565
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,594
A little.
But the gun matches.

566
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,474
And he's consistent with our witness
on the description and the scenario.

567
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,351
So, don't sweat it.

568
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:23,603
Kima...

569
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,565
Interrogation is more art
than science.

570
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:30,735
You've got to feel your way through
on instinct, mostly.

571
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:36,908
Take a look at this.

572
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:47,419
- Who are they?
- Some dancers who work at Barksdale's club.

573
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:52,590
I pulled their names off of liquor board
complaints and state employment records.

574
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:58,430
If you were going to try to turn
one these girls, which one would it be?

575
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,643
- Her.
- Why?

576
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:08,690
She doesn't have a record, for one thing.
She's just a DMV photo.

577
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:12,068
- Why else?
- I don't know. I can't really say.

578
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:14,320
I like her face.

579
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:18,283
Soul, conscience, whatever you want
to call it. She's a citizen, right?

580
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:21,828
It's in the eyes.

581
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,997
Instinct, Detective.

582
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,173
Yeah?

583
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,010
What?

584
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:39,888
Who is this?

585
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,017
He did?

586
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,771
How the hell did you
get my number?

587
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:53,276
Yeah. OK.

588
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:55,320
Yeah.

589
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,160
- Ma'am?
- Get this crazy bastard out of here.

590
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:05,371
- What's the matter?
- He set off the smoke alarm, twice.

591
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:07,415
That good, huh?

592
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:09,709
In the bathroom.

593
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,129
Bunk, it's Jimmy.

594
00:52:15,508 --> 00:52:17,509
What the fuck?

595
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,054
Bunk, wake the fuck up.

596
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,473
- Bunk, wake up.
- What, what?

597
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:26,309
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I hate you, Jimmy.

598
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,437
What are you doing?
Where are your fucking clothes?

599
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:33,733
Right here.

600
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:36,778
- Who gives a shit?
- Come on, man.

601
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:37,987
No, no. No.

602
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:41,032
What did you burn
your clothes for, man?

603
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:47,288
I got all the...
got hair, got fibers.

604
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:52,126
- Got pussy on it.
- What, trace evidence?

605
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:56,798
You smell pussy?
I don't smell no pussy no more.

606
00:52:57,258 --> 00:53:00,552
- Knock it off.
- I think you all can just take my ass home.

607
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:04,013
Trace lab ain't gonna have
shit on the Bunk.

608
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:08,393
That shit.
No fucking case file, Detective.

609
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,603
Where are your fucking
shoes, man?

610
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:14,941
Ma'am, you seen his shoes?

611
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:18,069
Give me that pussy,
and now you gonna take my shoes?

612
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:22,156
That ain't right, shit.

613
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,330
Oh, shit.

614
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,957
Christ, Jimmy.

615
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:20,632
Hey, Bunk, I'll give you that burning
trace evidence makes sense.

616
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:23,051
What the fuck did you plan
to wear home?

617
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:28,014
Oh, shit.

618
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:33,311
Hey, Jimmy, you know something?

619
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,940
You're no good for people, man.

620
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:42,528
I mean, damn.
Everybody around you...

621
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,114
Christ.
