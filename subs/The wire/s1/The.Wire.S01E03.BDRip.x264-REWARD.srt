1
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:12,428
- Yo, the shit is late.
- They still vialing up.

2
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,515
Usually come street-ready,
but this time they gotta vial.

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,184
- Y'all got any testers, man?
- Later.

4
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,602
Later.

5
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:23,189
- Got any testers?
- It ain't even nine, and you fiending on it.

6
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,317
Get the fuck out of here, man.
Damn.

7
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:32,198
- Why you act like that?
- What, for these junkie motherfuckers?

8
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:35,201
So you just gonna take his money
and treat him like a dog?

9
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:38,955
- How am I supposed to treat him?
- You ain't gotta punk him like that.

10
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,041
He punked hisself.
He's a goddamn drug addict.

11
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:45,128
- And you a goddamn drug dealer.
- So?

12
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:52,593
- So what? The customer's always right?
- We're in the projects.

13
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:56,556
The customer be fucked up.
You can't give these niggers shit, man.

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,225
Why not? Why can't you?

15
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,063
Everything else in the world get sold
without people taking advantage.

16
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:07,650
Scamming, lying, doing each other dirty.

17
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:11,320
- Why has it got to be that way with this?
- 'Cause they dope fiends.

18
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,408
Yeah, but the game
ain't gotta be played like that.

19
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,953
This shit can get done
without people beating on each other,

20
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,664
killing each other,
doing each other like dogs.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,170
Without all that, you ain't got Five-0 here
on our backs every five minutes,

22
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:30,673
- throwing us around and shit.
- Shit, man.

23
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:35,261
You think Five-0 would care about niggers
getting high? In the projects?

24
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,139
Man, Five-0 be down here
about the bodies.

25
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,516
That's what they be
down here about.

26
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:44,395
- Squires, young squires.
- What you want, nigger?

27
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:48,357
Got a little bag of styles
for you.

28
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,321
Check it out.

29
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:59,285
Only $5. Make you a gallant
motherfucker, right there, boy.

30
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,040
Him, we know.

31
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,733
<i>If you walk through the garden</i>

32
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:33,528
<i>You better watch your back</i>

33
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:38,199
<i>Well I beg your pardon</i>

34
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,077
<i>Walk the straight
and narrow track</i>

35
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,081
<i>If you walk with Jesus</i>

36
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,168
<i>He'll save your soul</i>

37
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,631
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

38
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,675
<i>Down in the hole</i>

39
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,304
<i>All the angels sing</i>

40
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,683
<i>About Jesus' mighty sword</i>

41
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,728
<i>And they shield you
with their wings</i>

42
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:12,400
<i>Keep you close to the Lord</i>

43
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,361
<i>Don't pay heed to temptation</i>

44
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:19,782
<i>For his hands are so cold</i>

45
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,744
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

46
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:27,373
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

47
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,717
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

48
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:41,637
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

49
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:46,642
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

50
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,520
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

51
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,696
What are we facing from the riot?

52
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,283
Three witnesses' statements,
all saying the officer's assault

53
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,160
on the youth was unprovoked.

54
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:08,623
Commissioner, people's idea of police
brutality is whenever we win a fight.

55
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:12,585
- What does the state's attorney say?
- He says it goes to a grand jury.

56
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:17,340
That's him doing Pontius Pilate. They don't
indict, he looks clean for passing the buck.

57
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,508
- And if they do indict?
- They won't.

58
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:25,473
Criminal histories on our three witnesses,
one longer than the next.

59
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,601
Drugs, weapons, assault,
more drugs.

60
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:32,730
- Shitbirds throwing dirt at good police.
- Just the same, Lieutenant,

61
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:37,360
I want you to rethink whatever tactic led you
to send three plainclothes officers

62
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:42,698
to do field interviews at the high-rises
at two in the morning.

63
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,453
- Yes, sir.
- I take it your people have union counsel?

64
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,871
Yes, sir.

65
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:53,334
Sir, I would request
that pending the grand jury review,

66
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:57,755
Officer Pryzbylewski be placed
on administrative leave.

67
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,467
We shouldn't have him on the street
until the grand jury signs off.

68
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,719
That's putting our tail
between our legs.

69
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:07,807
Our official stance has to be
he did nothing wrong out there.

70
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:11,686
- A 14-year-old is half-blind.
- And two of ours were injured as well.

71
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,730
Goddamn right.
They were fucking shooting at us out there.

72
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,316
Bobby, what do you think?

73
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:21,529
Keep him off the streets
until it clears the courthouse.

74
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,573
OK, then,
we wait on the grand jury.

75
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,498
Lieutenant. A moment, please.

76
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,422
What happened out there?

77
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:44,051
Did you know they were in the high-rises
without backup?

78
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,099
If I tell you yes,
I screwed up.

79
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,644
If I tell you no,
I'm putting my men in the jackpot.

80
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:57,189
Do you still want me to answer?

81
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,282
- I screwed up, sir.
- Good man, taking one for the company.

82
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:10,119
To hell with the company.
I'm defending my own people, that's all.

83
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,330
What Major Valchek means to say
is that he's grateful

84
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:17,752
that you extended your support
on behalf of Officer Pryzbylewski.

85
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,337
- Fuck-up that he is.
- He should be off the street.

86
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:24,383
What can I say? The kid needs
a little guidance, a little supervision.

87
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:29,680
Stan here thought that if he got
a young officer back on the street...

88
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,391
A new unit, a new lieutenant.

89
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:37,271
- That it might bring him around.
- I understand he messed up here.

90
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,274
Which is why
I'm saying to you

91
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:44,153
I owe you for walking him
through this grand jury thing.

92
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,530
To compensate,
Southeastern is sending you

93
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,575
two new unmarked units
and a surveillance van.

94
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:54,497
Plus, you need manpower while
these guys are busy with this IID thing,

95
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,624
all you do is ask.

96
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,418
Lieutenant.

97
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,091
So I've got suction with you,
Valchek?

98
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,176
That's what I'm saying.

99
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,721
Deputy, always a pleasure.

100
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,689
A necessary evil.

101
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,068
- What?
- Valchek.

102
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,071
Is it insubordinate
if I ask what's so necessary?

103
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,492
Thanks for not cutting
Pryzbylewski loose.

104
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:35,621
If you had, the department would be caught
between Valchek and city hall.

105
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:40,709
- I owe you for that.
- This Barksdale, he's dug in.

106
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,464
It may take more than buy-bust.
It's been in the press about the witness.

107
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,550
It's not an issue.

108
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,178
Keep it a tight little circle.

109
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:54,431
Three weeks of good street work
and you'll see this through.

110
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,393
A couple of felony warrants,
a little dope on the table.

111
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,770
That's all we need here.

112
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:03,399
Under no circumstances
is it accurate to suggest

113
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,694
that this particular homicide
was the result of the victim

114
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,697
having been a witness
in an earlier case.

115
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:13,242
Reports to the contrary
are without factual merit.

116
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:19,290
Are you saying you know definitely that
this man was not killed because he testified?

117
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:23,544
We think that... I mean,
we're looking into the possibility

118
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,797
that Mr. Gant was involved
in a street dispute.

119
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:31,051
Which, of course, would have nothing
to do with his being a witness

120
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:34,180
in an unrelated case
that concluded weeks ago.

121
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,641
But you haven't developed
a suspect at this time?

122
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,685
No, we haven't.

123
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:45,191
- Oh, Bunk, shame on you, lad.
- What did you expect him to do?

124
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,818
Grab the mic,
shove Rawls to the ground,

125
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:52,531
declare that all of Baltimore should rise as
one because they're murdering witnesses.

126
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:55,201
That sounds more like
one of your moves.

127
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:01,540
Been working on him two weeks
and we don't even have a photo.

128
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,626
It's fucking embarrassing.

129
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,837
Hey, Pat.

130
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:10,257
- We got a job for you guys to try to run down.
- What is it?

131
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:14,511
We need a photo of this guy Barksdale.
We need to know what he looks like.

132
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,348
- So go down to the B of I.
- That's the problem.

133
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:21,727
Barksdale's never been arrested as an adult,
so we don't really have a B of I photo.

134
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,397
His juvenile record was expunged,
so there's no photo there either.

135
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,234
Then you're fucked.

136
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:31,111
Yeah, we are.

137
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:35,449
But seeing as we all came into work today,
let's try something different.

138
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:39,328
So, we know from his mother's
social service record

139
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,414
that Barksdale grew up
in Franklin Terrace, right?

140
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:48,420
It occurred to me, being vaguely familiar
with the high-rises of West Baltimore,

141
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,881
that the housing project
began to take photos

142
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,968
of every registered resident
as a security measure.

143
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,388
- Am I correct, Detective Greggs?
- Yeah.

144
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:01,308
So you want us to go to the housing
department and pull his photo.

145
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:06,689
Excellent. You and I, we think as one.
We're like two horses together in a harness.

146
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,277
Why don't you fucking
do it yourself?

147
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,530
Sure, if you don't mind
reviewing homicide folders,

148
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,741
taking meticulous notes,
trying to run down a few new leads.

149
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:21,745
It's boring work but if you don't want
to travel to the housing department,

150
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,831
I'll switch with you.

151
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,502
Fuck it, Patrick.
Let's take a ride.

152
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,848
- That was inspiring.
- I'm a leader of men.

153
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,942
Yo.

154
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,653
- What's up with shop?
- No re-up.

155
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,364
- Why not?
- 'Cause we out of red caps.

156
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:01,368
Stink say we gonna have
a new package tomorrow.

157
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:06,206
This weak-ass stepped-on shit
we got out here get these fiends agitated.

158
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,292
They still buying it though.

159
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,920
They're buying twice as much
and only getting half as high.

160
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,006
What was that?

161
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,011
Castle can't move like that.
Castle move up and down or sideways.

162
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:23,057
- We ain't playing that.
- Look at the board. We're playing checkers.

163
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,017
- Checkers?
- Yeah, checkers.

164
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,854
- Why you playing checkers on a chess set?
- Why do you give a shit?

165
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,816
- Man, we ain't got no checkers.
- But chess is a better game.

166
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,526
So?

167
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:38,030
Hold up. Y'all don't know
how to play chess, do you?

168
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,532
- So?
- So, nothing, man.

169
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,786
- I'll teach y'all if you want to learn.
- No, come on.

170
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,122
- We're in the middle of a game.
- Chill out, I want to see this.

171
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,917
You can't be playing checkers
on no chessboard.

172
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:53,879
- All right, man.
- Check it, it's simple.

173
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,132
See this?

174
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:01,261
This is the kingpin.
And he the man.

175
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,098
You get the other dude's king,
you got the game.

176
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:07,184
But he's trying to get your king too,
so you gotta protect it.

177
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,187
Now the king,
he move one space

178
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,273
any direction he damn choose,
'cause he's the king.

179
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,401
Like this, all right?

180
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:20,364
But he ain't got no hustle. The rest of these
motherfuckers on the team got his back.

181
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,367
And they run so deep,
he really ain't gotta do shit.

182
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,453
- Like your uncle.
- Like my uncle.

183
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:31,417
You see this? This the queen.
She smart and she fierce.

184
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,378
She moves any way she want,
as far as she want.

185
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,548
And she is the go get
shit done piece.

186
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,051
Remind me of Stringer.

187
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:43,345
And this over here is the castle.

188
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,515
It's like the stash.

189
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,685
It moves like this and like this.

190
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,522
- Dog, stash don't move, man.
- Think.

191
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,942
How many times we move
the stash house this week?

192
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:01,071
Every time we move the stash, we got to move
a little muscle with it to protect it.

193
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:06,869
True. You right. What about them
little bald-headed bitches right there?

194
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:12,708
These right here? These are the pawns.
They like the soldiers.

195
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:17,296
They move like this, one space forward only,
except when they fight.

196
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,132
Then it's like... Or like this.

197
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,926
They the front lines.
They be out in the field.

198
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:27,097
- So how do you get to be the king?
- It ain't like that.

199
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:30,267
The king stay the king,
all right?

200
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,395
Everything stays who he is,
except for the pawns.

201
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,066
If a pawn make it all the way down
to the other dude's side,

202
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,736
he get to be queen.

203
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:45,491
And like I said, the queen ain't
no bitch. She got all the moves.

204
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:50,746
All right, so, if I make it
to the other end, I win?

205
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:55,584
If you catch the other dude's king
and trap it, then you win.

206
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,755
But if I make it to the end...
I'm top dog.

207
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,549
It ain't like that.

208
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:08,055
The pawns, man, in the game,
they get capped quick.

209
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,182
They be out the game early.

210
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,520
Unless they're some
smart-ass pawns.

211
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,072
Nagras.
Can you fucking believe this?

212
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,115
This shit is prehistoric.

213
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,535
What else have they got
down there in Property?

214
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:33,080
Eight-tracks? Victrolas?
That fucking department's a joke.

215
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:37,960
We gotta get with the feds. They got
light-weights, wireless micro-recorders.

216
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,128
Yeah, DEA got those.

217
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,381
If I wear this on a warm day,
they'll know.

218
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,092
Even if they do a half-assed
search, I'm done.

219
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,052
Nagras. Jesus.

220
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,973
You can't send his ass into the projects
with this shit taped to him.

221
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,393
- That ain't gonna play.
- I'm saying.

222
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:58,063
McNulty and the lezzer from narcotics,
they've got the file.

223
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,440
- Who are you partnered with?
- McNulty.

224
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:05,737
But he don't have shit to do with me and
I don't want nothing to do with him neither.

225
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:11,451
Major, I'm a fifth wheel on a car
that's going nowhere. Bring me home.

226
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:17,124
Soon enough.
You're my eyes and ears in this mess.

227
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,252
I don't want no more
surprises, like that article.

228
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,754
If McNulty's planning
any more bullshit,

229
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,550
I got to be able to tell the deputy
before the shit flies.

230
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:31,179
Then you come home with a favor
in your pocket. How bad is that?

231
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,670
Lieutenant.

232
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,091
You get Carver and Prez back tomorrow,
but Prez is in-office.

233
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,719
No police powers,
no street work, nothing.

234
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,472
If the building catches fire,
he stays in-office.

235
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:17,184
- What about Herc?
- Medical, until Monday at least.

236
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:24,566
I wonder what you gotta do
to get thrown off this police force.

237
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:29,321
Keep on with some of your shit,
you just might find out.

238
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,740
Where are the fucking
run sheets?

239
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,993
Behind the board.

240
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,331
You all go for a taste?

241
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,957
Hey.

242
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,045
We got your picture,
don't you fucking worry.

243
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,222
- This is Barksdale?
- Avon Barksdale.

244
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,017
- I don't think so.
- Read my lips.

245
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:03,021
Avon fucking Barksdale.
His name's on the form in the file.

246
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,773
Excuse me for giving a shit

247
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,402
but I can't help but notice
this is a middle-aged white man.

248
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,279
You want something different,
give me another name.

249
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:16,284
That's the only Avon Barksdale
in the housing department files.

250
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,205
You got your smokes?

251
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,666
Have a nice fucking day.

252
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,381
Maybe he's white.

253
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,345
No, I mean, really.
What do we really know?

254
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,266
Avon Barksdale.
31 years of age.

255
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,643
Born Provident Hospital,
West Baltimore,

256
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:45,981
to Willette Jackson Barksdale,
father unknown.

257
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,024
Educated Baltimore city schools.

258
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:51,653
Address is in the same public housing
where he controls the drug trade.

259
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:56,408
No flash, no profile.
Pretty much comes up out of nowhere.

260
00:17:56,492 --> 00:18:00,746
No work history.
No tax information we can look at.

261
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,416
No cars in his name,
no driver's license. No kids.

262
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,418
No priors either.

263
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:13,133
Yeah. Vague CI information that states he
stays in various apartments out in the county.

264
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,635
Addresses undetermined,
of course.

265
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,180
He moves from girlfriend
to girlfriend.

266
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,724
Might have another girlfriend
in New York.

267
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:25,729
He likes to work out and he used to box
Golden Gloves when he was younger.

268
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:30,484
Been working on him for two weeks
and the truth is, we don't know shit.

269
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,569
Golden Gloves?

270
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,448
- How did you hear that?
- I don't know.

271
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:42,037
I think I got that
from a DEA File,

272
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:46,666
from a CI who claimed to know him
way back when.

273
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,212
So you write everything down?

274
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,841
Yeah, everything.

275
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,642
- Goddamn bomb, y'all.
- Blue-tops.

276
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,435
Double shorts.

277
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,521
In the hole, man.

278
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,565
Got blue-tops.
Looking for blues?

279
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,070
Red-tops.

280
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,783
Two for 10.

281
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,894
Keep your jab moving.

282
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,816
Move with your right.
Left, right, left, right.

283
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,401
Two punches.

284
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:04,411
Few questions
I wanna ask you, Mack.

285
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,955
Keep your hands moving.
Work to the body.

286
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:09,666
- So who's your target?
- Barksdale.

287
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,252
- Who?
- Avon Barksdale.

288
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:16,423
- Never heard of him.
- He's got the Westside projects locked up.

289
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,384
He's tied to maybe a dozen murders,
he's off the radar.

290
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,678
- Avon, what was it?
- Barksdale.

291
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:22,888
If you say so.

292
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,891
DEA has a couple of pages
on him from NADDIS entries.

293
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,602
Nothing in NCIC, no adult arrests.

294
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,396
I've been working drugs
for the Bureau since '98.

295
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,317
I can tell you,
we got nothing on him that I know.

296
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:38,528
This little thing
is the smile of the week.

297
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,906
Watch this.

298
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,701
- What?
- What was that?

299
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,494
Get the door.

300
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:57,213
It's a career case. Not that my bosses
give a damn at this point.

301
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,507
- Why not?
- Why not?

302
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:04,262
All of them mopes in bracelets
and not one of them named Osama.

303
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:07,599
- I owe you. What do you need?
- A couple of lightweight body mics.

304
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:11,436
- Wireless, remote taping capability.
- That's all?

305
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,607
Hey, where I come from,
we're just happy to be in the 20th century.

306
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,693
Who's running the case,
so I can tell my squad supervisor?

307
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,363
Daniels, out of Narcotics.

308
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,867
All right, no problem.

309
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:33,625
Shit! Fucking rain, man.
Y'all know what the fuck this is.

310
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,796
- Up against the wall, hurry the fuck up.
- Come on, let's go.

311
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,594
Got red-tops, testers.
Get them around the corner.

312
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,888
Hurry up, take them around.

313
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,350
What you looking at me for?
Get round the corner.

314
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,947
I want that shit. That's good.

315
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,617
Keep it moving.

316
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,136
- You see that?
- Oh, yeah.

317
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,514
Third from the end.
That's the stash.

318
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:33,935
Some real raggedy-ass shit here, boy.
Very sloppy.

319
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:43,987
- How old are your kids?
- Mike is eight, Sean's ten.

320
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:48,533
- That's the hard part.
- That's the hard part but, you know...

321
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:53,329
- How often do you get to see them?
- Every other weekend.

322
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:56,332
- Trying to get more, but she's fighting me.
- Why?

323
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,126
She's getting even.

324
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,795
- Getting even?
- You must've been fucking around.

325
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,299
- I'm just saying.
- You're right.

326
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:08,803
Always the case. When a woman wants
to get even, there's something extra there.

327
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,806
How come you got all this wisdom
and your life's so hard?

328
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,976
I've been wondering
on that myself.

329
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,897
How about you?
You ever been married?

330
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:26,905
- What'd I say?
- If you ain't gonna say anything, I am.

331
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,908
If you're a dog,
you barking at the wrong pussy.

332
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,911
- So I'm a dog now?
- Meow.

333
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,954
Bubbs.

334
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,250
- I date women.
- Something in common. I date women too.

335
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,420
So pretty much everyone in CID
has worked this out but me?

336
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:46,758
- Nothing to figure out. I told them.
- I guess I missed the press conference.

337
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,928
It's better that than to have
every police on three shifts

338
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,846
hounding you every
goddamn day.

339
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:55,600
- Cops are dogs.
- Yeah!

340
00:23:55,684 --> 00:24:00,688
It's not like I was walking around waving
some dyke flag in the air, or some shit.

341
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:06,945
- I know I look like I could go either way.
- Lord, yes, you do.

342
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,948
It was something I had to put out there
to get through the day.

343
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,367
- I should've known.
- Should've known what?

344
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:17,122
I worked with one other female police
officer who was worth a damn.

345
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,165
- A lesbian.
- Yeah.

346
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:29,926
In the beginning, you're in your radio car,
alone, working your post.

347
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,054
- Most women aren't getting out that car.
- Right.

348
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,974
Not without side partners
showing up.

349
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,601
They're intimidated, physically.

350
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:40,478
- They gotta be.
- You weren't?

351
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:43,148
Yeah, at first.

352
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:47,944
But I'm talking about some old
straight-out-of-the-academy type scared.

353
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,363
I wasn't about to stay scared.

354
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:54,075
You know, you get
your ass kicked once or twice,

355
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,744
you realize it's not
the end of the world.

356
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,582
Most of the women don't want
to believe that.

357
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,376
Some of the men too.
They don't even want to go there.

358
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,212
- You think 'cause you're gay?
- I don't know.

359
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,715
But is there any other
fucking way to police?

360
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:14,012
All I know is I just
love the job.

361
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,685
- That'll be 3.20.
- Keep the change.

362
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,770
Thanks, have a nice day.

363
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:40,788
<i>Baby, say yeah,
say yeah</i>

364
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:46,586
<i>Baby, say yeah,
say yeah</i>

365
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:50,215
<i>I heard you're loving me</i>

366
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:53,092
<i>'Cause you're in love with me</i>

367
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,637
<i>My baby, gonna feel for you</i>

368
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,514
<i>Like I comfort you</i>

369
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:01,100
<i>You feel me...</i>

370
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:09,734
Hey, yo. Dee coming up.

371
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,381
Where does it all go?

372
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:36,469
The money.
Where do all the money go?

373
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,691
22, 24, give or take.

374
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,776
From the low-rises?

375
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,781
Damn, boy!
You must have that crew humming.

376
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:01,286
I don't remember a day we ever
got this much from the Courtyard.

377
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:05,123
- It wasn't even check day.
- You doing good out there, Dee.

378
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:09,210
We'll be doing even better
when we get that new package.

379
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,130
New package, same as old, man.

380
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,716
- Say what?
- Ain't no new package.

381
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,469
Just gonna put that same shit out
in a different color gel cap is all.

382
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:22,557
Might spike that shit with some procaine
or caffeine, but otherwise the same.

383
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,644
String, man, people are already coming
back on us telling us that shit is weak.

384
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:29,731
The shit is weak,
but shit is weak all over.

385
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:34,152
The thing is, no matter what we call
heroin, it's gonna get sold.

386
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,404
The shit is strong,
we gonna sell it.

387
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:40,199
The shit is weak, we gonna sell
twice as much. You know why?

388
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:43,828
'Cause a fiend, he's gonna chase
that shit no matter what.

389
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,872
It's crazy, you know?

390
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:50,293
We do worse,
and we get paid more.

391
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:55,340
The government do better
and it don't mean no never mind.

392
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:58,760
This shit right here, Dee,
it's forever.

393
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,854
That's a bonus right there.

394
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,775
Make sure you buy something
that you wouldn't otherwise.

395
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,944
Thanks, man.

396
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,577
All right.

397
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:42,136
Hey.

398
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,097
You remember me?

399
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:47,975
Do I remember you?

400
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,478
I was in here the other day.
You wanted a drink.

401
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,648
- Did I get a drink?
- Afraid not.

402
00:28:55,484 --> 00:29:00,196
Then why would I remember you?
You going about it the wrong way here.

403
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,614
All right.

404
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,162
Mary.

405
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,582
The usual.

406
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:15,670
- This here's my uncle's place.
- You kin to Orlando?

407
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,964
No.

408
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:24,554
Orlando's like the up-front man.
My uncle's the money man.

409
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,104
- Where you from?
- Right here.

410
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:37,275
- Baltimore.
- I know Baltimore, but where?

411
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,777
You know Turner Station?

412
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:43,698
Down past Dundalk,
near the Point.

413
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,243
The Point.
So, you're a country girl.

414
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:52,248
- You mean county.
- Where I'm from, the county is the country.

415
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,333
Where was that?

416
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,548
So...

417
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,052
are you working with your uncle?

418
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,638
I'm his right hand.

419
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,568
Yes, you is.

420
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,325
You want to ride with us
in the van?

421
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:30,161
- No.
- Why not?

422
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:33,164
You think it's a waste?

423
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:36,250
Touts and children,
that's all you're gonna get.

424
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,675
Bingo.

425
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,098
Where did you get this?

426
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,405
Look at this piece of shit.

427
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,534
I'm good to go, right?

428
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,787
Come here, let me see.

429
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:18,543
Detective Sydnor's ensemble
is the latest in Westside project wear.

430
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:21,295
Have your torn cammies
by Versace,

431
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:25,341
stained sweatshirt
by Ralph Lauren.

432
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,343
- Where are you miked?
- My dick.

433
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:30,054
I figure they ain't gonna go
down there, right?

434
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,057
I don't know,
the way you twirling around,

435
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,226
it might be the first place
they look.

436
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,144
Fuck you.

437
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:41,065
I ain't showered in two days,
I ain't shaved in four.

438
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:45,111
Right now, I am one ripe,
nasty son of a bitch.

439
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:49,156
Yo, Bubbs, what do you think?

440
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:54,412
- This your man?
- Yeah.

441
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,583
Is he low-bottom enough
for you?

442
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:04,672
Clothes is tore down enough, but he could
use a little bit more stains, more dirt.

443
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,969
- What's this here, man?
- It's my wedding ring.

444
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:15,641
Shit, you married
to the needle, boy.

445
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:20,313
That shit been pawned off, if you for real.
It's a dead giveaway.

446
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:24,650
You could stand to lose about 20 pounds,
some yellow in your teeth,

447
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:26,694
fresh bleeds on your hands.

448
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,114
So maybe I should go out
and shoot up dope for a year or two.

449
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:34,201
- Come back when I can carry the look off?
- I'm just saying, man.

450
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:37,580
The more tore down you look,
the better.

451
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,542
Down them towers,
they gonna check everything.

452
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:47,173
I know you ain't got no problem with
the shoes, fucked up as they are.

453
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:48,966
Let me see the shoes, man.

454
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:55,348
See? You walking down them alleys
of the projects,

455
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,808
you stepping on dead soldiers.

456
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,811
- Dead soldiers?
- Yeah, empty vials.

457
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:05,107
You can't walk down a Baltimore street
without them cracking underneath your feet.

458
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:09,737
You want to know if a fiend is for real,
check the bottom of his shoes.

459
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,743
OK? Have him dance on some empties
before we go out there.

460
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:19,080
Get us killed.

461
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,083
He hurt your feelings?

462
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,251
A little bit.

463
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,591
Shit.

464
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,760
<i>Hit it, yeah</i>

465
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,763
<i>Yeah...</i>

466
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:05,519
Four hand-to-hands, two to me, two to Bubbs,
with me close enough to mark it.

467
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,439
- From who?
- Kids, mostly.

468
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:12,401
- Young-ass hoppers.
- It's a start.

469
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:14,820
They're pretty tight
out here, Kima.

470
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:16,697
If you don't hand no money
to nobody that matters,

471
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:19,408
you don't get no product
from nobody that matters.

472
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:27,708
- You want to go back in?
- Shit, we copped from every crew out here.

473
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:33,297
Ain't we supposed to go off somewhere
and fire this shit up?

474
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:38,511
Let's get the fuck out of here.

475
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,068
Well, now.

476
00:35:56,822 --> 00:36:00,115
Did you get to see where the money went
after you handed it off?

477
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:02,243
No.

478
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:07,289
Nothing but touts
and runners here.

479
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,418
But then again,
you told us so.

480
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,671
I didn't say that.

481
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:16,340
But as a matter of fact...

482
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:30,020
Everyone else roll out?

483
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:35,484
You were upstairs and out of pocket,
so I cut them loose.

484
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:38,988
Just as well.
I'll give them the news tomorrow.

485
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,364
What happened?

486
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,742
I told the deputy we had a few
hand-to-hands. Low-level people.

487
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:46,704
He wants us to put everything
into search-and-seizures

488
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,582
- and hit the projects Wednesday afternoon.
- Lieutenant.

489
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:52,251
Does he think that will
get us Avon Barksdale?

490
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:56,130
The buys we made,
they don't even go past the courtyards.

491
00:36:57,132 --> 00:37:00,134
Scratch together everything
we got from the hand-to-hands

492
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,720
and shape it into PC
for the warrants.

493
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:06,974
- A few locations, at least.
- But we don't even know what doors to hit.

494
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:11,562
A few apartments in the low-rises
that we've seen used for stash.

495
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:16,066
- Then we write on those.
- They change stash houses every other day.

496
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:19,069
Look, the man upstairs wants
to see a circus.

497
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,906
A couple of days from now,
I got to show him three rings.

498
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,991
Christ.

499
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,621
I'm sorry. We gotta jump.

500
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:44,178
- Is the Deputy Ops stupid?
- No.

501
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,138
This shit is fucking stupid.

502
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:50,768
If we bring in some arrests, he takes them
to the judge, he figures the judge goes away.

503
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,437
Then he buries the fucking case.

504
00:37:57,317 --> 00:38:01,654
- What are we gonna do?
- Nothing, except pound out probable cause.

505
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:04,865
- We're gonna be here all fucking night.
- I'm not.

506
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,701
- Where the fuck you got to go?
- I mean I can't.

507
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,454
I'm not gonna help them gut the case.
I'm sorry.

508
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,831
He's your lieutenant.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

509
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:15,584
But I can't swallow
this shit any more.

510
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:24,301
<i>Mr. Johnson sings
over in a corner by the bar</i>

511
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:29,306
<i>Sold his soul to the devil
so he can play guitar</i>

512
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:35,771
<i>Too cool to be forgotten,
hey, hey...</i>

513
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:53,622
- Why are you here?
- I'm thinking about something.

514
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,417
- Can I come in?
- No.

515
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,627
No?

516
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:01,046
What's the matter?
No one ever tells you no?

517
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,965
Sorry. I should've called.

518
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,887
How do you clone a beeper?

519
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:12,182
- What?
- That's what I need to know.

520
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:15,769
You show up at my door at nine
o'clock to ask me that?

521
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:19,106
Every other drug dealer has a cell phone
and these guys are all on pagers.

522
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,613
What do you want to do?

523
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,909
Bunk and me, when we jack up
the Barksdale kid, he's got a Motorola pager.

524
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,164
- We give it back, so as not to spook him.
- You want to clone it?

525
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:38,375
Can we do that without a subpoena
to the pager company?

526
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,674
Read that.

527
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:49,011
- What is it?
- Affidavit from a state police case.

528
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:52,139
A judge signs something like that,
you can clone a beeper.

529
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,390
Christ.

530
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:56,393
Probable cause, coupled with
an exhaustion argument.

531
00:39:56,478 --> 00:40:00,439
You've got to show the judge
that other investigative methods have failed.

532
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:04,902
You'll also need a supervisor
who wants you to clone a suspect's pager

533
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:09,156
knowing that it might lead to who knows
what else, pen registers, wiretaps.

534
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,283
Daniels will come around.

535
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:15,454
Daniels will have your ass.

536
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,458
Thanks.

537
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,960
- That's it?
- What?

538
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:23,921
No.

539
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:46,568
Let me understand. You were married
and a date is a room at the Best Western.

540
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:50,447
Now you're single, and a date
is you coming over unannounced

541
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:53,700
to learn the legal requisites
for a pager intercept.

542
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,495
Pretty much.

543
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,164
No.

544
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:04,044
OK, I hear you.

545
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,040
You? You?

546
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,004
As if you give a shit.

547
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,818
You're an asshole, McNulty.

548
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,740
What the fuck did I do?

549
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:22,206
- Yo, how much more to that pack?
- 50, 60.

550
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,250
Re-up's late.

551
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:30,297
Have Wallace hit Stinkum
on his pager again.

552
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:34,468
- You want something from carry-out?
- Yeah, lake trout sub.

553
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,553
Pay up.

554
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,388
Damn.

555
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,432
You asked.
I thought you was treating.

556
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,851
You thought wrong.
I ain't no bank.

557
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,020
You stingy like one.

558
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,522
Just make sure
you give me enough.

559
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:52,402
- No mayo, extra hot, something to drink.
- All right.

560
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:03,247
He going for food? Why didn't you tell me?
My stomach's growling like a motherfucker.

561
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:06,208
- Starve, nigger.
- Man, shit.

562
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,418
Re-up's here.

563
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,420
Stink, what up?

564
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:13,131
What's up, bro?
10 minutes.

565
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:15,300
- Ten?
- Yeah.

566
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:26,979
Who there?

567
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,661
Y'all got my back, you heard?

568
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,746
Get the fuck in here.

569
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,501
Get your ass down.
Sit your stupid ass down.

570
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,504
Get the fuck down.
Shit, stay there, bitch.

571
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:56,675
Get the fuck down, motherfucker.

572
00:43:56,759 --> 00:44:00,220
- Where it at?
- Ain't nothing here.

573
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:02,723
Where it at, man?

574
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:11,565
Fuck, my leg!

575
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:13,734
Where it at, shorty?

576
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:22,743
- Kitchen, under the sink.
- Go on and get that.

577
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:40,052
Two G-packs. Let's roll.

578
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:43,180
- Just two?
- Omar, come on.

579
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:45,265
What the...

580
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,811
Stupid.

581
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,326
Shit!

582
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,578
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

583
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:10,457
Aw, shit.

584
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:19,299
Come on, Poot.

585
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:22,386
Fuck!

586
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:50,414
- So, your man saw them get jacked?
- Part of it.

587
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:54,334
- And he gets the tag number?
- Good man, that Bubbles.

588
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:57,796
Listen up.

589
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:02,509
Western uniforms will meet us
in the Mount Claire parking lot.

590
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,095
We start there, and we don't stop
till we take the doors.

591
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:09,516
I want their lookouts
to have as little chance as possible.

592
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,601
What's with you?

593
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:17,023
My office.

594
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,621
- I'm not going.
- You're insubordinate?

595
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:34,458
I'm not jumping out
on something that will harm the case.

596
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:37,919
- You want to write me up on that, you can.
- You think I want this?

597
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,338
I got the Deputy Ops on my ass
for this shit.

598
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:44,092
- You show me up in front of the detail.
- I don't mean to show anybody up.

599
00:46:44,177 --> 00:46:47,888
- Get your vest on.
- No. I got police work to do.

600
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,850
If you felt this way,
why didn't you call in sick?

601
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:55,187
- I'm not sick.
- Yeah, you are.

602
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:05,572
Give me a 95 on why you are physically
unable to participate in today's action.

603
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:09,451
- I'm gonna lie so you can save face?
- Write it up.

604
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:12,871
I can't jump out with my unit
because my tummy hurts.

605
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:18,126
I'm not gonna help you gut this case. If you
want to pretend to be a police, you go ahead.

606
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,939
Let's do it.

607
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:44,319
I'm up.

608
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,571
- You're on medical.
- I'm up, boss.

609
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,617
Give him a vest.

610
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:07,884
No, motherfucker.
It ain't just up to Stinkum to be muscle.

611
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:11,555
You got the Pit. Your people supposed
to be ready for the re-up.

612
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:15,392
You supposed to be steady for him.
But where you at?

613
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:17,936
You in the goddamn sandwich shop.

614
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,273
You got $20,000 coming
into your shop,

615
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:23,900
and you ain't even around
to see that shit right.

616
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:27,237
- I thought re-ups...
- Thinking was what you wasn't doing,

617
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,406
and now we look like bitches.

618
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,200
You feel me?
We got to come back on them.

619
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:35,328
And you can't even tell me shit
about who they was.

620
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:37,581
One of them was named Omar.

621
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:42,043
- Omar?
- Omar, that's the name I heard.

622
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:45,797
- And they had a white van.
- I saw the van.

623
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,174
What kind of van?

624
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,634
Five-0!

625
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:08,945
- Wrong door.
- Yeah?

626
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:11,031
Switched it yesterday.

627
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:15,619
Let's see your hands.
Get the fuck out the way.

628
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:18,330
Up, motherfucker, up.
Turn around.

629
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,500
All the way up.

630
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:33,678
Police. Put your hands up.

631
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:37,182
- Turn your monkey ass around.
- Put your hands at your back.

632
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:41,061
Why you fucking with us, man?
We wasn't even doing shit.

633
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:46,650
Come on, man.

634
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:53,490
- Cuff that one.
- Motherfucker, how's that feel?

635
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:57,243
You fucked up now.
You feel it, right?

636
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:01,581
Why you ain't swinging?

637
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:07,337
Motherfucker. Go ahead,
play that cowboy shit, motherfucker.

638
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,091
Hold him down. Hold his arms!

639
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:15,095
Spread your legs.
Don't make me kick your ass too.

640
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:22,143
Get him. You don't hit a cop.
What's wrong with you, boy?

641
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:33,113
<i>Dirty old town</i>

642
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:36,491
<i>I met my love</i>

643
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:40,453
<i>By the gasworks wall</i>

644
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:45,375
<i>Dreamed a dream...</i>

645
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:58,763
If you'd been here earlier,
you'd have seen a beating.

646
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:01,433
Clean.
Not a fucking thing in there.

647
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:04,894
Pick any door in the low-rises.
What are the chances?

648
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:26,624
Channel 2 wants to know if she can film
some of the places we raided.

649
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:30,128
She says whatever we got,
she'll put on film.

650
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:33,548
- Whatever we got?
- Drugs, weapons.

651
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,633
We ain't got shit.

652
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,659
I can tell you were
never in patrol.

653
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,870
Right.

654
00:52:14,507 --> 00:52:16,883
- Sorry I'm late.
- What's up?

655
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:22,472
I didn't want to tell you in front of the girl,
her being from Narcotics and all.

656
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:26,392
- Daniels is dirty.
- What?

657
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:29,604
The guy running your case,
he's got dirt on him.

658
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:30,939
You know this?

659
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:34,108
Your own agency came to us
with concerns about him last year.

660
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:35,860
Integrity questions.

661
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:39,823
They didn't want to go to Internal Affairs.
That office leaks like a sieve.

662
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:42,617
Plus they couldn't handle a case
if their lives depended on it.

663
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:45,495
- That too.
- You looked at Daniels specifically?

664
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:48,164
We did a two-month
assets investigation.

665
00:52:48,249 --> 00:52:52,919
He has a couple of hundred thousand more in
liquid assets than any lieutenant should have.

666
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:57,465
Maybe he goes to Atlantic City.
Seriously.

667
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:01,052
Did you look at his background?
Maybe he's got other sources of income.

668
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:04,806
- Maybe. We never got a chance to go further.
- Why not?

669
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:08,268
We told your Deputy for Operations
what we had.

670
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:11,437
- You took it to Burrell?
- He says, we'll take it from here.

671
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:14,274
We backed away and waited
for something to happen.

672
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:17,652
- And waited.
- That was a year ago?

673
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:22,365
Maybe more. And that fucker's
still the Supervisor for Narcotics.

674
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:25,285
So, you tell me
what the hell's going on.

675
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:33,001
Anyway, if he's running your case,
I just thought you'd want to know.

676
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,545
Thanks.
