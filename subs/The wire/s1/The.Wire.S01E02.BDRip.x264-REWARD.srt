1
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:12,553
That's the witness,
the one from the Barksdale case.

2
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:15,098
Gant, William. 41 years.

3
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:20,269
Single headshot, close range.
Bullet pancaked on the inner skull.

4
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:28,277
- Ain't necessarily what it looks like.
- No?

5
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,530
A man's walking down the street
in West Baltimore.

6
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:33,241
That'll catch you a bullet
for a half-dozen reasons.

7
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,660
That it will.
You run him for a sheet?

8
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:39,455
Yeah, a couple of disorderlies.
Works maintenance at Poe Homes.

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,166
Lives alone, no wife, no kids.

10
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,669
Only time his name pops up
on the computer

11
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,713
is for being a state witness.

12
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,965
Otherwise I don't even make
that connection.

13
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:58,057
You've got to admit, it don't make sense to
ace this motherfucker after he done testified.

14
00:00:58,142 --> 00:00:59,517
Sends a hell of a message.

15
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:03,563
He's the one hardheaded fuck in the Terrace
you can't run off or buy out.

16
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:07,734
If your audience is the high-rises,
a move like this cuts through the shit.

17
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:12,196
- What are you gonna tell the major?
- That I caught a stone fucking whodunnit.

18
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:15,116
- Don't soft-sell the witness angle.
- Come on.

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,202
Why get the bosses riled
before we know for sure?

20
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,705
If I start talking shit
that a witness got killed...

21
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,457
- Tell him.
- Why?

22
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,375
Just cover yourself on this.

23
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,879
Jimmy, you ain't gonna do
what I think?

24
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,258
Listen to me.

25
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,219
This shit is gonna jump up
and bite you in your ass.

26
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,722
Just cover yourself.

27
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:41,768
- What the hell was that about?
- Nothing.

28
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,361
<i>If you walk through the garden</i>

29
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,615
<i>You better watch your back</i>

30
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,911
<i>Well, I beg your pardon</i>

31
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:02,914
<i>Walk the straight and narrow track</i>

32
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,918
<i>If you walk with Jesus</i>

33
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,547
<i>He'll save your soul</i>

34
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,842
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

35
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,678
<i>Down in the hole</i>

36
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,350
<i>All the angels sing</i>

37
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,728
<i>About Jesus' mighty sword</i>

38
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,732
<i>And they shield you with their wings</i>

39
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:33,736
<i>Keep you close to the Lord</i>

40
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,323
<i>Don't pay heed to temptation</i>

41
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,911
<i>For his hands are so cold</i>

42
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,373
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

43
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:49,377
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

44
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,720
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

45
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,599
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

46
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,229
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

47
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,440
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

48
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,625
Morning.

49
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,177
Jesus Christ.

50
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,105
Goddamn.

51
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,567
Who do you got to fuck in this town
to get a real office?

52
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:39,737
At least that works.

53
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,542
It was for McNulty.

54
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,464
- I shouldn't be here.
- Then you shouldn't.

55
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,467
They killed a fucking witness
out of your court.

56
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,136
You told me.
You did your civic duty.

57
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:07,515
Under the power vested in me
by the circuit court for Baltimore city,

58
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,809
I absolve you of your sins,
Detective.

59
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,852
You are my sin, you know that?

60
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:15,314
For talking to you,
my major is ready to cut my throat.

61
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,566
Jimmy, you knew
I was gonna make that call.

62
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,696
I didn't think you would hang me out
on the line in a shitstorm.

63
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,740
It's not like it was
when I was a prosecutor.

64
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:28,411
- I'm a judge now. The rules are different.
- You missed a spot.

65
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,496
Yeah, well, what's done is done.

66
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,542
Question is,
what do you want me to do now?

67
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:38,587
- You can leverage the Deputy Ops with a call.
- He's already detailed people.

68
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,883
Some detail. Asshole lieutenant thinks
he can buy-bust his way to Avon Barksdale.

69
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,468
You want leverage?

70
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:48,514
We give the dead-witness angle
to the newspapers. Stir some real shit.

71
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,683
That tips Barksdale
we're working him.

72
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,352
- We don't want to go public.
- No?

73
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:57,273
Just put it to the Deputy Ops you lost
a witness who testified in your court,

74
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,317
forcing the department
to commit to the investigation.

75
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:04,363
And when you call Burrell this time,
will you forget my fucking name?

76
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:11,871
Hey!

77
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:15,207
- You missed a spot.
- Why don't you fucking do it?

78
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,959
Seniority.

79
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,478
- You found us.
- Wasn't easy.

80
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:39,023
- You asked for these guys?
- I asked for more manpower.

81
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,943
Have a seat.

82
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,370
What the fuck...

83
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,624
Sir, I...

84
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,251
He was showing me
the trigger pull on his Glock.

85
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,963
- And he was just...
- Detective?

86
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,675
Officer Pryzbylewski shot the wall,
Lieutenant.

87
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:08,552
Why?

88
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,138
Why did you shoot the wall,
Pryzbylewski?

89
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:15,601
I was just showing Carv
how my trigger pull is light, you know.

90
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,687
- I got it so it's real light.
- He took the clip out, boss.

91
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,148
But not the one in the chamber.

92
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,527
No, I forgot the one in the chamber

93
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,321
and, well...

94
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,573
Shit, I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

95
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,952
- You want him to write on it?
- Write on what?

96
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:37,373
You let one go, you got to write.
You got to justify the use of deadly force.

97
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,583
Against a plaster wall.

98
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:44,463
It's an accident, OK?
Give me a fucking break.

99
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,467
- Your name is what?
- Pryzbylewski.

100
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:53,556
From Auto Unit, right?
Cantrell sent you.

101
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,392
Not exactly.

102
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:01,438
Lieutenant Cantrell sent me to Casualty
Section a couple of months back.

103
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,983
And I asked out of Casualty.

104
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,573
You came here from Casualty Section?

105
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,785
Man, these shits is right, yo.

106
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,543
- It's good with the hot sauce too.
- Most definite.

107
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,589
- Yo, D, want some nuggets?
- No, go ahead, man.

108
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,717
Man, whoever invented these,
he off the hook.

109
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,260
Word!

110
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:35,097
Motherfucker got the bone
all the way out the damn chicken.

111
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:38,017
Till he came along,
niggers be chewing on drumsticks,

112
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,060
getting they fingers all greasy.

113
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,104
He said, later, to the bone.

114
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,565
Nugget that meat up,
make some real money.

115
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,443
- You think the man got paid?
- Who?

116
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,696
- Man who invented these.
- He richer than a motherfucker.

117
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,616
Why?
You think he get a percentage?

118
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,702
- Why not?
- Nigger, please.

119
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:01,081
The man who invented them, some sad-ass
down at the basement of McDonald's

120
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,709
thinking up shit to make money
for the real players.

121
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,462
- No man, that ain't right.
- Fuck right.

122
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,756
It ain't about right,
it's about money.

123
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,759
You think Ronald McDonald
gonna go down that basement

124
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,261
and say, Mr. Nugget,
you the bomb.

125
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:17,348
We selling chicken faster
than you can tear the bone out.

126
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:21,685
So I'm gonna write my clowny-ass name
on this fat-ass check for you.

127
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,103
Shit.

128
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:27,608
The nigger who invented them things,
still in the basement on regular wage

129
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:31,278
thinking of some shit
to make the fries taste better.

130
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:33,197
Believe.

131
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,869
He still had the idea though.

132
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,253
Who?

133
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,339
Polk and Pat Mahone.
A couple of drunks from Property.

134
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,299
- I don't know them.
- Why would you?

135
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,760
They haven't made a case
in 10 years.

136
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:58,180
Also got handed some kid.
Prezbelowski or Prezbelewski...

137
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,767
- Pryzbylewski. Him, I know.
- Yeah?

138
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,229
- Why was he in Casualty Section?
- He shot up his own car.

139
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,648
- You remember?
- He did what?

140
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:11,277
He fired two clips into an unmarked car,
out in West Baltimore.

141
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:15,322
Called in a signal 13 on the radio,
like he was under fire from a sniper.

142
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,449
You didn't hear about that?

143
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:22,246
He stuck to his story until Ballistics matched
the bullet to his off-duty weapon.

144
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,457
- We almost indicted him for false report.
- Why didn't you?

145
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,502
He's got some kind of suction
with the Mayor's office.

146
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,630
My point is, I can't build much
with the garbage they sent me.

147
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:35,175
So go to the deputy.
You've got his ear on this.

148
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,554
Why not?

149
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,639
I ask the deputy for manpower.

150
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:44,143
He tells Property to send two men,
and Special to send two more.

151
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,604
Those shift lieutenants know it's a chance
to dump their dead wood.

152
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,982
The deputy, he knows this too.

153
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,359
He could have offered
to let me pick but didn't.

154
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,571
- He sent me a message on this.
- And the message is?

155
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,198
Don't dig in, don't get fancy.

156
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,909
Put a quick charge on this Barksdale
and then get out.

157
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,246
If he sends me good police,
I might do good police work.

158
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,584
- But if the State's Attorney's office...
- No.

159
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,098
Rhonda, darling...

160
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:27,561
it's bad protocol for me to ask for help
and then trash the help I'm given.

161
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:31,357
- You, on the other hand...
- No way. My office doesn't play that way.

162
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,276
You people staff your cases,
you bring us casework.

163
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,112
I cross that line,
I like piss everyone off.

164
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:42,493
Best I can do is tell my unit chief
that you drew shit.

165
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:46,205
He wants to call the deputy for operations,
that's his choice.

166
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,624
- That won't happen.
- Probably not.

167
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,295
Make lemonade.

168
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,238
Ah, fuck!

169
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,865
Yo, Kima, where you taking us?

170
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,534
- Get down.
- What?

171
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,745
Jesus.
You all ain't got no creep to you.

172
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,581
Pair of goddamn elephants.

173
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,212
A rusted nail just went
through my shoe.

174
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,799
I'm gonna need a tetanus
to get behind this bullshit.

175
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,805
- Hey, Kima.
- Hand me that bag.

176
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,729
Kima, if you don't mind me asking,

177
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:57,484
when was it that you first figured
you liked women better than men?

178
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,361
I mind you asking.

179
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:09,663
Gentlemen,
what's going on there, guys?

180
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,458
- Testers, man, already out.
- No.

181
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:16,170
I'm not in need of your services,
I'm offering my services to y'all.

182
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,546
What you got in the bag?

183
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,884
One thing a gentleman of color like better
than a new pair of downtown shoes

184
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,094
is a downtown brim, right?

185
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,124
What's with the hats?

186
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,261
- Five-O!
- Five-O!

187
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,805
Shut it down!

188
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,685
Shut it down!

189
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:19,942
Clean?

190
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,307
You ain't gonna put that one on me.
He a witness.

191
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:56,270
You picked that shit up off the ground,
so don't be trying to put shit on me.

192
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,480
Is that what you think I'm about?

193
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,733
Boy thinks I'm gonna dirty him.

194
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,194
Like y'all won't do it.

195
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,114
Western narcos come here,
pick shit up off the ground

196
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,199
put it on whoever you please.

197
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,119
Do I know you?

198
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:15,747
Let's understand each other.
I'm not Western District.

199
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,333
I'm not a narco.
I don't dirty people

200
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,627
'cause I don't care
about a possession charge.

201
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:24,172
I'm a murder police,
I'm here about the bodies.

202
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,552
D'Angelo here knows that.
He remembers me from the trial.

203
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:32,764
Sitting in back there, behind Stringer,
watching, listening.

204
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,309
Y'all hassling me about
that shit?

205
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,394
I thought you heard
what the jury said.

206
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,897
- Fuck the jury.
- Yeah, this is just us talking, right?

207
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:44,443
Just you, me, my partner and...
What did you say your name was?

208
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,028
I didn't say shit.

209
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,322
Just you, me, my partner
and Mr. Shit here.

210
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,825
We're just talking about
how things go, right?

211
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:55,787
We're just sharing our thoughts.
Bunk, a vial for your thoughts.

212
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:59,625
I'm thinking it's one thing for
one of you little niggers

213
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:03,837
to shoot somebody in the 221 Building,
you know? Who gives a fuck?

214
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,298
- But when you ace a witness...
- A working man.

215
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,550
Who ain't even in the game...

216
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,219
You gonna act like this is news?

217
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:16,808
I tell you this, I don't know shit
about shit, but I do know this...

218
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:20,812
anybody who spend time witnessing shit,
you gonna get got.

219
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:25,817
I know that sounds kinda harsh
but that's the way things go around here...

220
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,944
Officer.

221
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,739
Let's roll.

222
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:46,505
That how you see things, D'Angelo?
Like your friend here?

223
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:55,722
I'm here trying to outfit niggers
with something to rile up some pussy.

224
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,684
You don't want to know,
Bubbles used to get that pussy.

225
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,479
I reckon pussy ain't worth
what it used to be

226
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,273
if you can do it
without a proper brim.

227
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,382
- Something's up.
- What?

228
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,467
Don't know.

229
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,556
Yo, Carv. Come here.

230
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,477
You see Bubbs put a hat on anybody,
you take some pictures.

231
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,563
- Yeah?
- Especially the red one.

232
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,733
If you see him put that red hat
on anybody's head

233
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,568
snap your fucking fingers off.

234
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,653
Where you going?

235
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,365
Yo, Carv.
Notice that most of the time

236
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,160
it's like Kima thinks
she's above us or something?

237
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:02,456
I don't see any stripes on her
fucking sleeve. I don't see that.

238
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,250
All I see is some
stuck-up dyke bitch

239
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,544
who ain't been in CID
half the time you or me,

240
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,046
and she's fucking telling us
what to do.

241
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:13,425
It ain't right.
You think it's right?

242
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:17,846
Shut up for just a minute.
I'm trying to concentrate on this shit here.

243
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,437
Nice truck.

244
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,278
No?
Makes your breath minty fresh.

245
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,114
Is y'all gonna arrest me?
Then arrest me.

246
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,532
If not, shut the fuck up.

247
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,284
- You want to get arrested?
- No.

248
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,162
- Shut the fuck up your own self.
- I'm outta here.

249
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,874
Hey, hey! D'Angelo.
You better bend the fuck over.

250
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:53,131
- You ain't got nothing else to do today?
- No, no, nothing.

251
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,759
Y'all ain't got no charge.

252
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:04,267
You getting awfully close, man.
You new on the force or some shit?

253
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,696
All right, D.

254
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,641
Move it, move it.

255
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,945
Hey, it's Greggs.
Get me the lieutenant.

256
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:04,494
Prez? He's no good to anyone,
he's a goof.

257
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:08,206
How is he my problem?
How is he still carrying a gun and badge?

258
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,250
You know Valchek in Southeast?

259
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,627
- Yeah.
- Son-in-law.

260
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,172
I can't carry him on this.
You know who Special sent me?

261
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,633
- Who?
- Polk and Mahone.

262
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,219
With them,
I don't have a designated driver.

263
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:25,599
- I gave you someone from Pawnshop.
- Lester Freamon? A cuddly housecat.

264
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,809
I don't think
he can even find his gun.

265
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,938
Take Pryzbylewski back.

266
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:35,483
You know I can't. I would, but I can't.
I gave Valchek my word.

267
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,320
I can't help it that Prez
is fucking the guy's daughter.

268
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:42,032
- If not for that, he's gone.
- So, you got suction with Valchek?

269
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,660
If I cross him, I'm fucked
on the next round of promotions.

270
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,455
I'm with you
on the short list for major.

271
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,374
Valchek has suction
with the Democratic Club,

272
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:55,503
they got suction with the Mayor
and I'm the runt without a tit here.

273
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,589
I owe you, OK?

274
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,926
- So, give me Sydnor.
- No way.

275
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,262
- Give me Sydnor and I'll keep Prez.
- You can't take my best man.

276
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:07,641
- I'm taking your worst, remember?
- How about Steinman?

277
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,893
I'm working drugs in West Baltimore.

278
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:13,730
I need a black guy for surveillance.
I need Sydnor.

279
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,858
- Know what Prez did this morning?
- Tell me.

280
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,946
He put a bullet through a wall,
dry-firing in the detail office.

281
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,991
No promises. You give me Sydnor,
I'll carry Pryzbylewski as long as I can.

282
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:28,286
Fine, Cedric, fuck, whatever.
Jesus Christ.

283
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,461
How did you handle the judge?

284
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,506
I told him we were looking
closely at the situation.

285
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,425
I asked him not to say
anything publicly.

286
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,304
So, then he's not gonna go
public, right?

287
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,557
Judge Phelan called,

288
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,644
crying about a witness
in his murder trial who was killed.

289
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,896
Did the judge say where he heard it?

290
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:59,359
He heard it from our man, McNulty.
That's his pipeline on this crap.

291
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:04,322
Pardon my French, but I got no problem
giving that asshole up at this point.

292
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:07,325
- I don't need people I can't trust.
- Yeah, who does?

293
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,829
The newspapers get hold of this,
it'll be a complete clusterfuck.

294
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:14,082
So the thing to do
is reassure the judge,

295
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,668
keep him off his damn soapbox.

296
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,878
An arrest or two would help.

297
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:24,634
What if it's true? What if Barksdale ordered
the murder of a state's witness?

298
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,177
Are you serious?

299
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,805
Why would anyone do that
after they testify?

300
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:32,267
- It has no effect on the case.
- Payback, plain and simple.

301
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,352
Bullshit, plain and simple.

302
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:38,732
I know there could be two dozen reasons
for this man to be murdered but...

303
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:43,194
No money for pretrial.
No witness protection program.

304
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,740
Look, this is a poor fucking
city, gentlemen.

305
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:51,369
The last thing we ever need to do
is to announce we lost a witness.

306
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:55,540
It's hard enough pushing felony casework
through that courthouse as it is.

307
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:59,544
- You got to pull McNulty off this.
- Who caught the murder case?

308
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,964
- Bunk Moreland, McNulty's partner.
- You'd have to pull him too.

309
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:07,677
No, we pull McNulty up,
the judge will bring the press into this.

310
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:10,180
I can see that a mile away.

311
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:13,725
No, we're gonna sit tight,
let McNulty take his best shot

312
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,644
and hope like hell
he comes up short.

313
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:22,150
- How do you wanna handle this?
- We got nothing on him.

314
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,904
- We try to front, he'll see right through us.
- He's scared though. Soft.

315
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,199
Go with the deuce?

316
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:32,202
Hold up, hold up.

317
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,376
- He part of my case?
- No, sir.

318
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:43,296
He's a potential suspect in my murder.

319
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,883
Which might be part of my case.

320
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,931
I could use some coffee.
You want some coffee?

321
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,230
- I need a word with you.
- We're about to...

322
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:01,356
Now.

323
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,612
Remember all that bullshit I gave you
about keeping me informed,

324
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,614
about nothing happening
that I don't know about?

325
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,491
- Lieutenant.
- Wasn't bullshit.

326
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:15,036
My partner caught a murder.
It may have nothing to do with Barksdale.

327
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,288
I just came from Deputy Ops' office

328
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,958
where your own major's
telling Burrell to do you.

329
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,293
You hear me?
Rawls is giving you up.

330
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:25,713
- What the fuck did I do?
- You can't shut your mouth.

331
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,467
You think that downtown judge
is gonna bail your ass out?

332
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:32,804
You really think that?
You should have come to me.

333
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,807
We bring this business to the deputy
first, we got a shot.

334
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,309
But you're out there all alone,
jumping bad.

335
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,645
- You got the deputy's ear?
- On this case, I do.

336
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,106
Then how come they sent
every worthless hump?

337
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,568
You ask for men,
they send you drunks and fuck-ups.

338
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,738
I want to do this case.

339
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,282
So do I.

340
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,868
Then you're gonna get all the way in,
Lieutenant.

341
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:59,247
If I see you get all the way in,
then I know who you are, what you're about.

342
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,001
- Who is he?
- He's D'Angelo Barksdale.

343
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,003
Nephew to the king.

344
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:08,256
- The one that beat the murder.
- Yeah, him.

345
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,216
Can you connect him
to the dead witness?

346
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:13,344
- Not a thing.
- Why did you pick him up?

347
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,600
Press him.
See what kind of flex he shows.

348
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:22,604
- She goes in with you.
- We don't need her.

349
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,647
Bunk and me,
we got our own rhythm.

350
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:28,568
You want me in, McNulty?
I thought you said you wanted me in.

351
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:34,782
You're along for this interview,
but it's Homicide's play, so let 'em lead.

352
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:42,207
You might want to run
tag and title on these trucks.

353
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,417
They scoped us
when we jacked the kid.

354
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:48,213
Been there.
Info's already in the file.

355
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,799
Y'all weren't the only lawmen
down in the Canyon today.

356
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:55,220
- Really, where were you?
- Where was she?

357
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:05,897
I mean, the thing is, I can't see
a reason for that man to be dead.

358
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,900
I can't. I mean, hell,
you beat us in court.

359
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,985
- We don't take it personal.
- Fuck, no.

360
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:14,948
We get paid either way.
And it's not like you did anything real bad,

361
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:17,408
throwing a couple of hot ones
at Pooh Blanchard.

362
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,452
No one's gonna miss
that motherfucker.

363
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,038
But you know the man
who got killed this time?

364
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,415
You know who that poor
son of a bitch was?

365
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,625
A citizen.

366
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,878
Worked every goddamn day of his life.
You know that?

367
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:32,757
He would get up every day,
go out and do maintenance work.

368
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,593
On the weekends,
he was driving a cab.

369
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:39,639
Two jobs. He volunteers what little time
he has left at his church.

370
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:43,268
- Churchgoing man.
- A Bethel man, a deacon.

371
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:47,480
Two jobs and three kids.
Did you know that?

372
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,108
Three kids. Young too.

373
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:53,319
Five, eight, eleven.

374
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:58,449
Crying their little orphaned asses to sleep
'cause they lost their mama...

375
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:01,160
and now they out there
on their own.

376
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,748
He doesn't believe us.

377
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,959
I know he don't believe it.

378
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,212
We've been here two hours,
telling you what's true

379
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,922
and you sit like
nothing happened.

380
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:16,134
- Where my lawyer at?
- When he gets here, we'll let you know.

381
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:18,428
I got nothing to say.

382
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,930
I'm sorry for the man
but I got nothing to say.

383
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:24,684
You sorry? You sorry for him?
You fucking killed the man.

384
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,811
- No.
- Yes, you did.

385
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,397
We don't think that you shot him
or anything

386
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,400
but if you weren't busy
lighting folks up in a lobby,

387
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,444
he ain't coming out and seeing it.

388
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:38,990
He don't see anything, he doesn't testify
and those kids still got a daddy.

389
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,326
- Why he testify?
- How should we know?

390
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,620
- He didn't have to testify.
- No, he didn't, but he did.

391
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,748
And you still beat the charge.

392
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:49,250
But it's not enough
to beat the murder.

393
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:51,627
They gotta send a cold message
to everyone in the Terrace.

394
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:55,256
Fuck the working man.
Fuck his kids, that shit don't count.

395
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,803
That's what I don't get
about the drug thing.

396
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:04,223
Why can't you sell the shit
and walk the fuck away?

397
00:28:04,401 --> 00:28:08,061
Know what I mean? Everything else
in this country gets sold

398
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,521
without people shooting
each other.

399
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,483
In the Terrace,
it's one body after another.

400
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,069
Remember that little boy,

401
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:19,781
got shot in the barbershop
on West Lombard last summer?

402
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:24,160
One asshole chases another
into a house,

403
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,620
empties a 9.

404
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,373
Bullshit argument
over 20 missing gel caps.

405
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,379
That little kid, instead of getting
his first haircut, gets one in the eye.

406
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,714
Remember that?

407
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,634
- It's fucked up.
- Yes, it is.

408
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,097
They didn't have to do that.

409
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,391
Shoot up a barbershop?

410
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,559
No, they did not have to do that.

411
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,481
That man was just...

412
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,318
my thing.

413
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:02,156
My thing, ain't had...

414
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,326
They ain't had to do that.

415
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,712
No mommy and no daddy.

416
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,549
Lord Jesus!

417
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,806
I'll tell you what I think
you should do, D'Angelo,

418
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:30,852
not because I think you wanted
that man to get shot

419
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,563
or had anything to do
with shooting him.

420
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:37,108
But I think
you could just sit here

421
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:41,320
for a moment or two, collect your thoughts,
get your shit together.

422
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,240
And then I think
it might be a good thing

423
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,827
for you to write a little letter
to those children

424
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,663
and you let 'em know you sorry...

425
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:55,710
that they're not gonna have
anyone left, you know?

426
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,754
I mean, just say something.

427
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,924
Tell them how you personally
think your uncle...

428
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,551
maybe he got it wrong,

429
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:08,848
because it's wrong that they lost their daddy
behind what happened, you know?

430
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:15,396
It might mean something to 'em to know
that you feeling for 'em.

431
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,238
Man, I ain't got nothing to say.

432
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,742
Just say what's in your heart.

433
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:51,724
Church deacon? That was thick.

434
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,268
Got good to me, what can I say?

435
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:58,064
It's sad enough with the kids
being orphaned.

436
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,816
Photo was from Bunk's desk.

437
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:05,321
- They're yours?
- Yeah, afraid so.

438
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:09,534
Good thing they look
like their mama.

439
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:12,954
Maurice Levy just posted.
He's by the elevators.

440
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,714
- The defense never rests.
- Shame on you.

441
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:26,676
Dragging me from the family preserve
on a Friday night.

442
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,136
- My apologies.
- Yvette made brisket.

443
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,639
- Good?
- When served hot. One or two?

444
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:34,100
Your client.

445
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,310
What the fuck?
Stop writing! Now!

446
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,312
- I'm just...
- Shut up!

447
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,149
He calls his lawyer, that's supposed to be
the end of the interview.

448
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,569
Your client gave no statement.

449
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:48,531
He just decided, voluntarily, to write
a letter to the victim's family.

450
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,866
- To say that...
- Shut up!

451
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:55,496
- Any charge here?
- No charge.

452
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:59,125
Good. Get up. Go! Walk!

453
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,963
Listen to me,
you don't say anything,

454
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,424
don't do anything,
don't write anything.

455
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,092
Do you hear me?
Shut up!

456
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:13,472
How many fucking times do I have to tell
you people the same fucking thing?

457
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,031
What the fuck is that?

458
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:36,704
It's an armoire.
Louis XIV.

459
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,041
I mean, what is it, a toy?

460
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:44,879
Some of you I know.
Some of you I will know.

461
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:48,549
If you've worked with me before,
you know I don't want cowboy shit

462
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:50,801
or surprises.

463
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,887
The task...

464
00:32:56,058 --> 00:33:00,144
is Avon Barksdale,
and Avon Barksdale only.

465
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,771
No side trips, no sprawl.

466
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,485
Primary investigators
are Greggs from my unit and...

467
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:14,116
Greggs from my unit
and McNulty from Homicide.

468
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:18,037
They keep the file.
On the street, we work partners.

469
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:21,707
Greggs and Sydnor.
Herc and Carver.

470
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:25,628
McNulty's with Santangelo,
Mahone and Polk.

471
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,296
Pryzbylewski and Freamon.

472
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,715
To start with, we got nine...

473
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,718
How's that? Did that get it?

474
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:36,138
- What?
- Do you hear me?

475
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,224
What?

476
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:44,730
We have nine or ten open homicide files
to work back through for leads.

477
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:47,483
McNulty and Santangelo,
they're on that.

478
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:52,029
Herc, Carver, Sydnor, and me,
we'll be targeting street dealers

479
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:54,573
and rolling them back up
at Barksdale's people.

480
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:57,868
Polk and Mahone are available
to run down specific leads.

481
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:02,039
Freamon, Pryzbylewski, are gonna
start in-office on clerical duty.

482
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:05,626
- You need a prosecutor...
- No, turn the shit off!

483
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,504
What?

484
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,381
You need a prosecutor.

485
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,259
Rhonda Pearlman from Narcotics
is assigned.

486
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,471
We don't have enough desks yet,
so we gotta share...

487
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,349
- Y'all from Purchasing?
- No.

488
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:30,818
We've been promised some computers
and surveillance equipment.

489
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,070
- Questions?
- Yeah.

490
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,281
Who signs the overtime slips?

491
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,825
No OT, unless prior authorization.

492
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,454
A case goes from red to black
by way of green, Lieutenant.

493
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:44,582
You people bring me
something that needs OT,

494
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,292
you'll get OT.

495
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:49,837
Until then,
live on your fucking salaries.

496
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:06,520
I'm very sorry for your father.
If I could've stopped it, I would have.

497
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:11,150
- What can you do with this?
- Nothing legally.

498
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:15,112
He doesn't put himself in,
or anyone else for that matter.

499
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:16,947
You can't read that letter

500
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:20,451
and think that man was killed
for any other reason than he was a witness.

501
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,537
Why apologize at all
if you got nothing to do with it?

502
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,962
We lost a state's witness.

503
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:35,466
Even in Baltimore,
that's supposed to mean something, right?

504
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,802
Just go to the deputy,
show him what's what

505
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,762
and put something real together.

506
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:43,516
This case needs informants,
it needs long-term surveillance

507
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,476
and eventually, a Title 3 wiretap.

508
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:50,314
Most of all, it needs police who know
how to work those things.

509
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,652
You think it's good to put it out
on the street that witnesses get killed?

510
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:57,446
You think
it's not on the street already?

511
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,826
No grandstanding.

512
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,954
Like I said, we get in and out.

513
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,390
- Hey, Aunt June.
- Hey, sweetie.

514
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,894
Yeah, I hope you're hungry.

515
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:30,771
Starving.

516
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,356
Hey, D!

517
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,900
What's up, baby?

518
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:37,653
- That your uncle?
- Yeah.

519
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,363
I thought he'd look different.

520
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,408
My man, D. What's up, man?

521
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,952
- This the little man?
- Yo.

522
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:48,873
You see how shorty
favor your nephew here?

523
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:52,334
What's up, little man?
You ain't gonna be able to deny that child.

524
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:56,255
You wanna come to me?
I know you tryin' to come to me.

525
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,965
- Been napping.
- Yeah?

526
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,385
- Just woke up.
- You got a grip? Let me see your grip.

527
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:04,555
C'mon, give us a twirl,
let's take a look.

528
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:07,892
What you looking at?

529
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:12,521
Go fix her a hot plate. Put everything on it.
She's the skinniest thing in here.

530
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:13,939
We gonna hook you up.

531
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:16,317
Don't let that fool you,
she can eat, man.

532
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:20,321
- How y'all doing? You doing good?
- Yeah, we all right.

533
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:23,407
She want me to move in,
I'm thinking about it.

534
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,910
Let's walk.

535
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,830
Here you come.
You gonna take my man from me?

536
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:33,459
- Yeah.
- Be careful with my little soldier.

537
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,670
- Got a name for that one?
- No.

538
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,758
But he's one of the boys
they use in the stairwell.

539
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,928
- What about him?
- That's Little Man.

540
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,679
He's muscle.

541
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,349
You know his real name?

542
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:52,811
- CI?
- Yeah.

543
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:56,065
- You need some privacy?
- No, it's all right.

544
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,525
He's cool.

545
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:02,780
What's with the hat?

546
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,324
Go ahead, tell him, Bubbles.

547
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:09,286
I go down the way
with some hats that I'm selling.

548
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,497
If someone is someone
you need to know

549
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:15,125
I put the red hat on them
and Kima here take the pictures.

550
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,379
If they in the mix, they get another color.
If they ain't shit, they don't get shit.

551
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:21,507
Everyone in the hat's
part of Barksdale's crew?

552
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:23,384
At the Terrace.

553
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,678
We haven't hit the low-rises yet.

554
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:29,807
That's sharp. I like that.

555
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,642
Bubbs does not forget a face.

556
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,937
Ain't so good with names,
but faces I keep in my head.

557
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:38,816
I used to take him to Escape Unit,
let him look through the warrant books.

558
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:43,404
He'd call me up that night,
telling me to go to this corner, that corner.

559
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,782
Yeah, paid $25 a pop.

560
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,909
- That's good money.
- Yeah.

561
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,578
How much does the hat routine pay?

562
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:53,831
Nothing.

563
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,041
We free on this.

564
00:38:57,711 --> 00:39:01,088
- Motherfuckers beat my boy down.
- Who?

565
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,257
Little hoppers in the low-rises.

566
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:06,510
- Who's your boy?
- I got a friend.

567
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:12,057
Younger white boy. Used to come down
to the corners, real green.

568
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:13,684
I was schooling him, you know?

569
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,603
What happened?

570
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:19,565
- They stomped him.
- You see it?

571
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:26,155
Fuck a man like that up
for a couple of dollars, you know?

572
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,866
He still at University,
tubes all up in his nose.

573
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,285
Can't say but a fucking
word or two.

574
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:35,914
But you know,
that's how it goes, right?

575
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,709
How you feeling, Bubbs?

576
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,545
Restless.

577
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,840
Yeah, I could tell.

578
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:48,635
What the fuck? Can you hook a nigger up
with $10 then till tomorrow?

579
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,555
I mean, you know,
just to carry me, Kima.

580
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:59,646
Bubbs.

581
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,275
Obliged.

582
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:07,154
Stay out of the projects
the next couple of days.

583
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,407
- Just to be safe.
- This girl's always fretting over me.

584
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,161
- Change it up, Bubbs.
- Yeah, yeah.

585
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,829
Go eastside.

586
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,332
Yeah, yeah.

587
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:20,793
Twenty dollars?

588
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:23,587
You gonna spoil him
with that shit.

589
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,964
I respect the work.

590
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,344
They used your name, Stringer,

591
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,179
Wee-Bey,

592
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,014
Savino, Peanut...

593
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,768
They knew a lot of names.
They knew a lot.

594
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,853
But you didn't say nothing?

595
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:43,524
Shit, man, I don't know nothing.

596
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,651
What was you writing then?

597
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,572
They talked about the man who got killed,
his kids, they asked me to write.

598
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:54,159
- What you got to do with them?
- That's what I said.

599
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:56,495
They cried about how
the kids ain't doing good.

600
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:00,290
It ain't gonna hurt for me
to say I'm sorry the man got killed.

601
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,751
Why the fuck you gotta say
you sorry?

602
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:05,420
Motherfuckers tried to put
your ass in the stir.

603
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,631
Yeah, but it didn't turn
out that way.

604
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:11,009
You know, that's what I'm saying,
it's a shame that y'all...

605
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:17,808
I'm saying, it's a shame
what happened to that man, all right?

606
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:23,063
He didn't do nothing but come off the
elevator when I was doing that thing.

607
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:26,358
What you think, cuz?

608
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,902
About what?

609
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,321
What you think about
what happened to the man?

610
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:33,574
You think we killed
the motherfucker?

611
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,995
Speak your mind.

612
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:43,500
- Man, I don't know.
- Exactly.

613
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:45,502
And you don't need to know.

614
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:48,922
And if we did, we had a reason.
And if we didn't, we had a reason.

615
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:52,092
Either way,
you ain't got shit to do with it.

616
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,469
It ain't on you, cuz.

617
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,597
You feel me?
It ain't on you.

618
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,808
Now, if you get jacked again,

619
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:03,270
I don't want to hear shit
about you writing nothing to no one.

620
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,689
- Got it?
- Yeah.

621
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:09,401
Come on,
let's have some good times

622
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,738
and get some ribs
before they ate all the ribs up.

623
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,618
- This case isn't shit, Carv.
- I know it.

624
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:21,413
We're dancing around
with this motherfucker, typing shit out,

625
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,707
taking pictures of assholes in hats.

626
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,084
- What the fuck is that?
- It's bullshit.

627
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:29,087
I say we go down there right now.
Right fucking now.

628
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:32,132
We go into those towers,
and we let them know.

629
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:34,593
I'm serious.

630
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:37,846
You got to let these motherfuckers
know who you are.

631
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,141
You coming?

632
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:45,312
- I'm with you.
- Carv?

633
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,233
What the hell?

634
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,318
Let's do it.

635
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,783
Come on.

636
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:12,965
- Shut it down.
- Five-O.

637
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:16,635
Five-O, Five-O, break up.

638
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:37,489
Come here, man.
Where you going?

639
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:40,409
Don't act like you don't know me.
Get your hands up.

640
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:41,827
Put that down.

641
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:45,706
- Drop it! Kiss the fucking ground!
- Put your hands up.

642
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,917
Don't look at me
like I ain't talking English.

643
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:52,671
You got a needle on you?
Got anything in here that's gonna stick me?

644
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:55,340
No? What's that?

645
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,968
What you got in your pockets?

646
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,095
You know what?
Put your pants down, man.

647
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,264
Pants down
and get down on the ground.

648
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,349
Down on the fucking ground!

649
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,479
All right, spread your shit out.

650
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:12,399
- Nice shoes.
- Think a happy thought.

651
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:18,238
Why don't you go somewhere else
with that bullshit?

652
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:24,453
- No-good motherfuckers.
- Stay down, man, stay down.

653
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:27,456
Y'all let Barksdale and them know
who owns these towers.

654
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,957
'Cause we coming back.

655
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:31,168
- I'm sick of this shit.
- Kiss my ass!

656
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:34,338
We come back in an hour,
catch everybody dirty.

657
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,341
- That's bullshit, man.
- Stay down, man.

658
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:40,510
That's fucked up.
Man ain't did nothing.

659
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:44,306
Want something?

660
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:51,104
- Move, shitbird.
- I ain't doing nothing.

661
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:56,360
Really?
I got nothing for you.

662
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:02,407
- My eye, my eye.
- Who you gonna eyefuck now?

663
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,370
Are you serious?

664
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,705
You bleed on my car?
Don't bleed on my car.

665
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:11,333
Get your shit off my car.

666
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:19,674
What the fuck's the matter
with you?

667
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:42,155
Got a visual?

668
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:44,282
Fuck.

669
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:46,368
Get the radio.

670
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,497
1135, signal 13.

671
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,333
771 Franklin, in the Court.

672
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,168
Son of a bitch!

673
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:58,088
Shots fired,
officers need assistance.

674
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:01,383
I'm hit! Signal 13.

675
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,718
Officer down. Officer down!

676
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:12,561
Shit!

677
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:35,625
- Hello?
- You seen the paper?

678
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,420
- What?
- The newspaper, get it.

679
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,190
Hey, kids.

680
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:21,588
Oh, no.

681
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:24,841
You happy now, bitch?

682
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,763
McNulty!

683
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,265
Where in fuck is he?

684
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,101
He's detailed, Major,
to Narcotics...

685
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:38,355
I fucking know where he's detailed.
I already know that!

686
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:39,564
Yes, sir.

687
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:42,192
- Where is he right now?
- I can page him, sir.

688
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:49,115
Move that fucking desk
out of my unit.

689
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,160
I do not want that
fucking man's desk in my unit.

690
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:54,287
That's Crutchfield's desk.

691
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,250
Crutchfield's?

692
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:00,627
McNulty sits here.

693
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:10,762
- What was that about?
- Did you see today's paper?

694
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:13,974
- Just sports.
- You gotta check out the front page.

695
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:23,358
- What'll they do to him?
- Let me tell you something.

696
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:26,903
If he gets caught with his dick up
the ass of the deputy's wife

697
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:32,325
he's still gonna have more of a career
than if they find out he's behind that story.

698
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,681
Lieutenant.

699
00:48:55,975 --> 00:49:00,520
I saw the story in the paper.
I want you to know I had nothing to do...

700
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:24,669
- They jumped us, Boss.
- Who?

701
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:26,296
Fucking project niggers.

702
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,341
What are you doing here
at two in the morning?

703
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,844
Field interviews, police work.

704
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,639
- Police work?
- Yeah.

705
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:41,645
I got a 14-year-old in critical
but stable condition at University,

706
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,647
and two witnesses
who say one of you

707
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:46,441
- cold-cocked him with a pistol.
- No, sir.

708
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:49,861
I got his mother over at IID
filing a brutality charge,

709
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:52,656
which for Herc will make four
in the last two years.

710
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,658
- None sustained.
- But all true.

711
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:55,742
We thought that...

712
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,495
I got one less Crown Vic
than I had last night,

713
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:01,247
I'm out two Kevlar vests
that burned in the car,

714
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,583
two hand-held radios, a shotgun,

715
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:07,337
and I'm about to lose this idiot here
for a week or two of medical.

716
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,673
- And for what?
- Lieutenant...

717
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:12,676
What did you learn when you went
at two in the morning

718
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,719
to conduct field interviews?

719
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:19,265
What valuable information
did we acquire from this situation?

720
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:25,188
IID is gonna be on all three of you
by afternoon.

721
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,732
If you don't get a story
straight by then,

722
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:32,278
you're gonna have a file thick enough
to see the light of a trial board.

723
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:37,117
Now tell me,
who cold-cocked the kid?

724
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,627
Me.

725
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:52,632
Why?

726
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:55,844
He pissed me off.

727
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:02,392
No, Officer Pryzbylewski,
he did not piss you off.

728
00:51:03,436 --> 00:51:07,564
He made you fear for your safety
and that of your fellow officers.

729
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,650
I'm guessing now, but maybe...

730
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:14,112
he was seen to pick up a bottle
and menace officers Hauk and Carver

731
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:17,407
who had already sustained injury
from flying projectiles.

732
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:20,285
Rather than use deadly force
in such a situation,

733
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:24,664
maybe you elected to approach the youth,
ordering him to drop the bottle.

734
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:27,500
Maybe when he raised the bottle,

735
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:30,754
you used a Kel-Lite,
not the handle of your service weapon,

736
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:33,298
to incapacitate the suspect.

737
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,885
Go practice.

738
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:40,722
You fuck the bullshit up
when you talk to Internal,

739
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:43,308
I can't fix it,
you're on your own.

740
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:55,111
- Push the arraignments back to three.
- And the Gillette case?

741
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:57,864
The Gillette trial goes back
on the move docket.

742
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,784
Come on, walk with me.
I'm running late.

743
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,330
- It wasn't me.
- The story quoted you.

744
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:08,458
Reporter has the story
when he calls me about the quote.

745
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:13,630
Am I gonna say he wasn't a witness?
He didn't testify in my court last week?

746
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:15,131
What?

747
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:17,383
You don't think it's around
about the witness?

748
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:20,470
Lawyers, clerks, jurors,
everybody talks.

749
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:24,224
- I'm in the shit here, Your Honor.
- What can I tell you?

750
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:27,435
I called the deputy, not the newspapers.
I gotta run.

751
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:36,152
- You should have hung them.
- If I hang them, I hang myself.

752
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:38,404
I'm the man in charge, remember?

753
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:41,574
Besides, you don't
give your people up to IID.

754
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,326
You don't do that.

755
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,412
Even if they put
a 14-year-old into critical care?

756
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,503
This case, it's just...

757
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:56,172
Get out of it.

758
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:58,550
- How do I do that?
- I don't know.

759
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:01,302
But you can't lose
if you don't play.

760
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:05,598
I always heard it that
you can't win if you don't play.

761
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:08,685
The department puts you on a case
it doesn't want.

762
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:11,688
You're given people
that are useless or untrustworthy.

763
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:13,606
Correct.

764
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:18,236
If you push too hard and any shit hits
the fan, you'll be blamed for it.

765
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,529
Correct.

766
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:23,867
If you don't push hard enough and there's
no arrest, you'll be blamed for that too.

767
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,368
Correct.

768
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,745
The game is rigged.

769
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,456
But you cannot lose
if you do not play.

770
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:44,846
- Sylvia!
- Yes, Mickey?

771
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,640
How do you call your lover boy?

772
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:49,559
Come here, lover boy!

773
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:53,229
- And if he doesn't answer?
- Oh, lover boy.

774
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:56,733
- And if he still doesn't answer?
- I simply say...

775
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:58,526
<i>Baby...</i>

776
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,544
In the hole, y'all.

777
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:13,935
<i>Baby, my sweet baby...</i>

778
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,696
Hey!

779
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,781
Hey, you fuckheads!

780
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,453
Police!

781
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,276
- Hello.
- Lieutenant Daniels?

782
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,694
Yeah.

783
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:16,706
Who was that?

784
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:20,168
It was the duty officer
down at University Hospital.

785
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:22,170
What happened?

786
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,715
- He's blind in one eye.
- Who?

787
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:30,303
The kid. The 14-year-old.
