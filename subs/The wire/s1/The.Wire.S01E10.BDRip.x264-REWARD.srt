1
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,366
This is the second time this week I had to pay
for a sitter 'cause he was workin' late.

2
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,410
With all that money he make,
you can afford it.

3
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:50,633
Lord.

4
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:00,727
What's up, Bubbs?

5
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,480
Hey.

6
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,400
Well, there you go.

7
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:13,448
- What you got?
- I got some starters.

8
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,225
<i>If you walk through the garden</i>

9
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,937
<i>You better watch your back</i>

10
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,358
<i>Well, I beg your pardon</i>

11
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,320
<i>Walk the straight
and narrow track</i>

12
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,282
<i>If you walk with Jesus</i>

13
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,119
<i>He'll save your soul</i>

14
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:04,499
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

15
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,376
<i>Down in the hole</i>

16
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,963
<i>All the angels sing</i>

17
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,301
<i>About Jesus' mighty sword</i>

18
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,347
<i>And they shield you
with their wings</i>

19
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,809
<i>Keep you close to the Lord</i>

20
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:26,813
<i>Don't pay heed to temptation</i>

21
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:31,234
<i>For his hands are so cold</i>

22
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,362
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

23
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,241
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

24
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,835
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

25
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,630
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

26
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,717
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

27
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,930
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

28
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,146
My fault, A.

29
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:13,276
- Should've never left you alone, homie.
- No, shit.

30
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,361
Man, you didn't pull up
when you did, I'm gone.

31
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,615
Listen, what I want to know is how
we fucking come back on this cocksucker.

32
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,702
We don't. Not now.
You feel me?

33
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,163
Listen, Stringer,
your advice was good advice.

34
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:27,874
You know what I'm saying?
I wanted you to know that.

35
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,294
I want you to put the word
out there,

36
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,505
let him know we willing
to squash this, if he is.

37
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,549
What the fuck if he ain't?

38
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,970
No, this nigger live in the town too.
He gonna listen, if we parley.

39
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,431
And then when he creep
out of his hole...

40
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,558
- Boom.
- Smoke him.

41
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,476
Say no more, got you.

42
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:48,853
- Put that out there, yo.
- All right.

43
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,109
About them police though,
they was on your ass after the game?

44
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,820
Yeah, man,
it was like two cars.

45
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,116
See, if they on you,
then they got a name.

46
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,619
If they got a name,
they know you got no license.

47
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:08,706
But they don't want no traffic charges,
you know? They don't want no humble shit.

48
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,125
I think they was trying
to see where I might go.

49
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:13,753
Where was you gonna take them?

50
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,923
I was taking them to the barbershop.
For a haircut.

51
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,049
Get a fade?

52
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:23,262
I know, B, but these motherfuckers
are on us. Fuck.

53
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:26,349
They always been on us.
We just gotta be careful.

54
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:32,229
You not been talking on any phones
and you not been touching any drugs.

55
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:35,066
And from now on,
you are not doing the money runs.

56
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:38,569
Me and Bey gonna take care of that shit
until this whole thing cool off.

57
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,823
- Let me get that pager.
- What's up? You serious?

58
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,576
Serious. I'm gonna get you
a New York supply number only.

59
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,664
Any motherfucking local cats
wanna talk to you, they gotta talk to me.

60
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,380
We gotta build a wall
around you, B.

61
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,094
Another month on a fresh phone?

62
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,555
They ripped out the payphones
in the low-rises. Now they're walking.

63
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,308
How much longer until
you bring this case in, Jimmy?

64
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,644
The quicker you can, the better for
everybody, yourself included.

65
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,147
Look at this.
Judge Gwynn sends his regrets.

66
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,067
He can't make lunch.
Like I got the plague all of a sudden.

67
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,694
There's your new phone.
30 days.

68
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,948
When Burrell wanted to take down the wire,
you broke off on his ass.

69
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,783
Jimmy, there's a lady here.

70
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,536
Rhonda talks more trash than
both of us, Your Honor.

71
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,998
I have never been anything other
than ladylike, Your Honor.

72
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,085
Detective McNulty is going out of his way
to insult an officer of the court.

73
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,963
- McNulty, I hold you in contempt.
- Who doesn't?

74
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,591
What's with him?

75
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,760
- You haven't heard?
- No.

76
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,434
- What's wrong with the picture?
- Don't know.

77
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,602
Phelan isn't in it.

78
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,315
What? He's up for election?
I thought judges had 15-year terms.

79
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:02,528
They do, but Phelan was named to finish
Halpern's term, which only had two years left.

80
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,489
- So he has to run on his own in the primary.
- He's not on the ticket?

81
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,366
Why the fuck not?

82
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,036
Maybe it's the company he keeps.

83
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,496
Oh, fuck.

84
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,833
No, see, you ain't thinking about
how much room the baby gonna need.

85
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,169
Specially when he get to growing

86
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,963
'cause there are things
we got to have.

87
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,008
Like a real crib, a play desk

88
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,469
and, you know, he got to have
one of them Little Tikes cars.

89
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,305
I'm not saying your place
ain't nice enough

90
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:33,809
'cause for you, it do just fine,
but if we gonna be a family,

91
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,562
we need at least one more
room, if not two.

92
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,315
So you add the bedroom set,

93
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:43,319
a nice bedroom set like the one they got
down at that baby store on Howard Street.

94
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,446
That's a room right there.

95
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,282
And I think we might get
some better furniture

96
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:52,495
and put your stuff in the other
bedroom like it was a den,

97
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,956
'cause the sofa you got
seen better days.

98
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,338
Dee, where you goin' at?

99
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,759
I told you I need money
for the new bedroom set. Dee!

100
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,720
- Why you holler at me?
- Yo, man, we getting down to it.

101
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,555
I get to you when I get to you.

102
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,684
- That's the main stash house.
- Say what?

103
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,313
The incoming call is the guy who runs
the main stash for Barksdale.

104
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:20,856
- Who is he?
- We don't know.

105
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,652
- So, y'all are just guessing he's on the stash.
- No, he's on it.

106
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,989
Lester was checking the logs a couple
weeks ago when he picked up the pattern.

107
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:33,119
When they get down to the ends on a package
somebody in the tower hits that pager.

108
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,788
Then, within a half-hour,
every time

109
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:39,125
a call comes back to the tower payphone
from that number in Pimlico.

110
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,043
Which is?

111
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,255
It's a payphone at a Mondo Mart
in Reisterstown on Cold Spring Lane.

112
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,316
You see it now?

113
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:55,266
When the supply gets low,
they page this mope,

114
00:07:55,767 --> 00:08:00,187
who always calls back from a payphone
way the fuck out in north-west.

115
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:05,609
- Same phone, same pattern.
- So y'all think that he's taking the re-up order

116
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,237
and that the stash is somewhere
near the Mondo Mart, right?

117
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,949
- You are on it, Detective Sydnor.
- OK, so what do you do with this?

118
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,742
What do we do?

119
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,332
We'll be sittin' on that phone in Pimlico
day and night waitin' on Mr. Mondo Mart.

120
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,751
- Herc too.
- Herc's out this whole week.

121
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:25,254
- In-service training.
- That's too bad.

122
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,884
So, instead of three eight-hour shifts,
you two are gonna have to pull 12 hours.

123
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,387
Just fucking kill me now.

124
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,766
- Heard from Omar?
- Nope.

125
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,978
I'm gonna go try to scare him up.
Where you gonna be?

126
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:45,858
Well, everyone's saying this kid's all
tore up about the dead stickup boy.

127
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,060
I'm gonna see for myself.

128
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,238
- You need us, we're on the radio.
- Okay.

129
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,440
Hey, what up, man?

130
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,447
This first time,
I can go four ounces of rock

131
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:37,201
but hey, if the shit is right,
then next time I can step that up.

132
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,161
Almost ain't worth it for four.

133
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:45,125
Just this first go-round. Do right by me,
I'll turn around and come back on it.

134
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,460
Where your money at, man?

135
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,846
We good.

136
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,850
So, where the shit at?

137
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:53,527
Ain't nobody been there but you.
Nobody came in my house but you.

138
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:58,073
Nobody but you. You're the only person
that came in my house.

139
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,076
So what you got goin' for you?

140
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:04,246
Ain't got nothing left,
burnt it away.

141
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:06,749
Family?

142
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,752
Mother dead.
Father, who the fuck know?

143
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,046
Brothers, sisters?

144
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,761
A sister, she lets me stay in the basement
but she lock the door so I can't go upstairs.

145
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:20,262
About the best
she can do for me.

146
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:25,559
Got a kid, a son.
Imagine me bringing life into the world.

147
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,103
- What's his name?
- Keyshawn.

148
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:33,150
His mother took him up Jersey way,
said I wasn't fit to be with the boy.

149
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,902
- I ain't disagreein'.
- Well.

150
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,155
At least you got your health.

151
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,116
Here's to health.

152
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:45,954
I got the bug.

153
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,291
Had it since '94.

154
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,170
Gave that shit to my old lady.

155
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,673
Worried about passing it on
to my baby girl.

156
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,468
No, I was spared that at least.

157
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,263
Damn, how do you carry it?

158
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,643
- You ask her forgiveness?
- Of course.

159
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,814
- What she say?
- What she needed to say.

160
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,442
Look, forgiveness from
other folks is good

161
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,404
but ain't nothing but words
coming at you from outside.

162
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,533
You wanna kick this shit,
you got to forgive your own self.

163
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:32,918
Love yourself some, brother.
Then drag your sorry ass to some meetings.

164
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,838
- Meetings?
- What the fuck you wanna hear?

165
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:40,384
That you're strong enough to do this
by yourself? Getting clean's the easy part.

166
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,178
Now comes life.

167
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,852
It's this one here with
the orange cord coming out at the back.

168
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:51,728
They're pirating juice
from the other house.

169
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,940
You gotta be kidding me.
Now I'm policing for BG and E?

170
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,278
They're not there yet,
but when this kid posts, snatch him up.

171
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:03,949
Park our asses outside this shit-hole
and wait for some little project yo?

172
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,160
Mrs. McNulty raised no fools.

173
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,037
Four Faidley's crabcakes
in the bag,

174
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,789
24 Dutch beers in the box.

175
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,792
- Faidley's?
- You're all right, McNulty.

176
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,129
I don't care what all them
other fucks downtown say about you.

177
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,007
11-35, what's up?

178
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,551
Our friend wants to meet.
Same spot.

179
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:26,221
- Copy that, 15 minutes.
- What's the deal with the yo-boy?

180
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,891
- What'd he do?
- Stumbled into my world.

181
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,252
I can't talk to you.

182
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,758
- I have to go.
- Shardene.

183
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,927
- I said, I have to go.
- I can't have five minutes?

184
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,220
No, not right now.

185
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,391
Fuck!

186
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,274
How close did you get?

187
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,111
Y'all be chalking that nigger if Wee-Bey
ain't pop up at the last second.

188
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,322
Remember when we last talked?

189
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,950
You were gonna lay back,
let us work our case.

190
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,618
I said I'd do what I can.

191
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,830
Still, I thought I might let y'all know
Avon's people got in contact

192
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,666
talking about how they want
to end the beef.

193
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,878
- They offered me some kind of amnesty.
- Amnesty?

194
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,130
Look, I chill out on the manhunt

195
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,133
and stop hitting them in the head
for they product,

196
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,136
- they gonna call off the bounty.
- Take the truce, Omar.

197
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,557
I might, if they ain't
trying to play me.

198
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,352
- They said they want to parley on it.
- Parley?

199
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,022
Look, I don't know, man, but right now
I need some assistance from y'all.

200
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,538
Yo, son, I go to the ER
and word get back to Avon,

201
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,165
you know he gonna have his henchmen
waiting in the parking lot for me.

202
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,674
Look, I know y'all friendly
with a couple of doctors, right? Right?

203
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,323
He says he can buy weight.
Says he runs with some decent-size locals.

204
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,869
- Like who?
- Avon something. Barksdale.

205
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,621
Avon Barksdale?

206
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,875
Run it through the DECS and HIDA.
See what comes back.

207
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:07,466
I'm gonna check around, see if anybody's
working these names you given us.

208
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,385
If you full of shit, pal,
I'm gonna know it quick.

209
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:15,724
- What happens to me while you checking?
- Eager Street. City jail, motherfucker.

210
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,229
Blue came home last week.
I ain't seen him since.

211
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,484
Yeah.

212
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,278
I can't believe it.

213
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,761
- Damn, Carv, you's triflin'.
- Yeah, I admit it, I'm disgusting.

214
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,764
Cheese puffs and fucking
Ring-Dings?

215
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,599
Yeah.

216
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,713
- Yeah.
- The big fuck from the high-rise.

217
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,798
- What's his name?
- Little Man.

218
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,299
Yeah, him.

219
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,135
All right.

220
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,105
- Yo.
- Be ready, we're on it.

221
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,696
Look at this pretty motherfucker.

222
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,082
Too fucked up to drive
home, McNulty?

223
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,511
Hey, Bunk.

224
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,645
Kid gave us a murder.
More than that, he's put in Stringer Bell.

225
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,522
Oh, yeah?

226
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,943
Picks out Wee-Bey, Bird and Stinkum from
photo arrays. Puts 'em all up at the Greek's

227
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:35,530
the night they grab up Omar's boy, Brandon.
Puts Bell in the truck too.

228
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,034
Says, Stringer told me
to point out the stickup boy.

229
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,038
- Jeez, what do you have over him?
- Not a fucking thing.

230
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,041
Kid was ready,
barely had to push him.

231
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,002
- Whose case?
- Norris's.

232
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,923
- How old?
- 16.

233
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,092
Lives in a shit-hole vacant
over on Argyle.

234
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,678
When I grab him up,
I swear he's halfway into a nod.

235
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,639
Using?

236
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,811
When they kill the stickup boy
they dumped the body in the alley

237
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:09,481
behind where this kid and the other low-rise
hoppers lay their heads. Can you imagine?

238
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,151
All he can think about.

239
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,695
You tell him
he's gonna have to testify?

240
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,699
Not yet, we'll get there.
Problem is, what do I do with him now?

241
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,135
- Yeah.
- Big boy picking up.

242
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,805
Okay.

243
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,601
- You holler at me, right?
- Where you at, man?

244
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,019
We on our way down.

245
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,437
First thing tomorrow, man.

246
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,528
- Yeah?
- It's him. Stay on it.

247
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,472
I didn't do nothing.
Get me outta here.

248
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:34,065
The 2-2, grounded slowly towards third,
and it kicks through at the last moment.

249
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,525
Where my phone call at?

250
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,694
Suzuki's at the plate.

251
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,905
Here's the pitch.

252
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:44,117
Line drive, up the middle,
a base hit for Suzuki.

253
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:48,538
Suzuki's very patient
at the plate.

254
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,665
Yeah, man, it's me.

255
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,918
Guess who's up in here.

256
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,379
Pimpin'-ass Orlando,
from the club.

257
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,674
Yeah. Courtside.

258
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:31,456
- So how long you been slingin'?
- Since I was, maybe, 12.

259
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,793
How long were you
with Barksdale's crew?

260
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:39,130
With D'Angelo? Not long.

261
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,841
He came down from the towers
at the beginning of the summer.

262
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,260
Before that I worked
for Ronnie Mo.

263
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,555
D'Angelo ever talk to you about
what happened in the 221 Building

264
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,307
with Pooh getting shot?

265
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:52,519
How about anything else
like that?

266
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:55,730
- Like what?
- Killings, murders.

267
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:01,111
He say anything about a girl getting shot
in an apartment up on the Eastside?

268
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,785
No, Dee,
Dee was good to me.

269
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,204
He all right.

270
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,331
But D'Angelo,

271
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,292
he was who you called that night
when you saw the stickup boy at the Greek's?

272
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,961
Yeah, but he didn't go up there.

273
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,171
It was mostly those tower boys.

274
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:24,592
And Stringer. You said Stringer
was in the truck. He called you over.

275
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,886
Asked you to point out
the stickup boy.

276
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:38,690
All of it corroborated by the beeper logs
and the pen registers from the payphones.

277
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:42,277
Stinkum's dead. We've got Bird for
the Gant killing. This ties them all in.

278
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,611
D'Angelo too.

279
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,322
Maybe, but since he didn't show
at the Greek's,

280
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,284
he tells the jury
he didn't see the murder coming.

281
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,619
- Well, it's enough to charge him, anyway.
- Parents?

282
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,289
Alcoholic mother.
No fixed address.

283
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,292
Says he's got a grandmother
on the Eastern Shore.

284
00:22:57,418 --> 00:23:00,503
- How about a hotel room?
- On whose dime?

285
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:05,133
The deputy won't approve the manpower to
stash a 16-year-old, much less room service.

286
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:06,801
McNulty, line two.

287
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:19,397
How about you run this up to front office?
See if the state's attorney will kick in.

288
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:21,649
He's a kid, Cedric.

289
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:23,860
Even if we clear the money

290
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:27,322
do you really wanna put a juvenile in a hotel
for six months waiting on a trial date?

291
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,493
I think you all need to get with
the grandma down on the shore.

292
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:35,747
Now?
She's doing this right now?

293
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:40,001
They don't have to set a hearing date
or something like that?

294
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:46,174
Christ, yeah, okay.
Yeah.

295
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,346
I fuckin' need a fuckin' lawyer.

296
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:57,685
What?

297
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,438
Still, you can see
that they got the security bars

298
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,565
and look there.

299
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,025
Cameras

300
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,278
that see over the yard,
out to the street.

301
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:10,657
Verizon said there's no phone service
at that address.

302
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,575
That's a telltale right there.

303
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,370
So what? We try to write
a warrant for this place, right?

304
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:16,538
Right?

305
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,051
- What are you seeing?
- No pattern, really.

306
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,637
Except this cluster of old storefronts

307
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,430
and warehouses on the west side
of downtown.

308
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:38,184
Around Paca, Eutaw,
Howard Street, mostly.

309
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,812
- Storefronts?
- Vacants, usually.

310
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:42,939
Three different holding
companies...

311
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,693
- Detective Pryzbylewski.
- What?

312
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,988
You have a gift
for the paper trail.

313
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,660
Tomorrow calls for some street work
though. Are you street ready?

314
00:24:58,746 --> 00:25:03,543
You know the lieutenant has me in-office.
I don't have my gun until the Grand Jury.

315
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,254
- You won't need one.
- On the street? No gun?

316
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,631
No gun. Not for this.

317
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:14,679
Furthermore, Mr. McNulty,
having utilized his sons

318
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:18,224
in an act of police work
involving a criminal suspect,

319
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:22,020
actually lost track of them
in a crowded municipal market.

320
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,689
This is simply unacceptable,
Your Honor.

321
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:30,069
Be that as it may, an emergency ex parte order
is an extraordinary request, Mr. Palmer.

322
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:33,698
You actually want me to limit
visitations to afternoons only

323
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:37,118
and you want Mrs. McNulty present
at all visitations? Come on.

324
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,621
It is not a single lapse, Judge.

325
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:44,292
Mr. McNulty has time and again
failed to properly care for the children

326
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,793
when they're in his custody.

327
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:50,089
I have a list of recent events, Your Honor,
that justify an order.

328
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,967
Ms. Pearlman, you have a response
you'd like to offer up here?

329
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:56,304
Nope.

330
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,139
Nothing?

331
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:04,354
If this were possession with intent,
I'd be a prosecutor with a plan

332
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:08,691
but a domestic order hearing?
Your Honor, I'm officially clueless.

333
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:12,862
In fact, as an employee of the state,
I should not actually be here.

334
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:15,907
All right, listen up, people.

335
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,077
Before you have me making a ruling
on an emergency petition,

336
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:22,163
everybody here needs to take a deep
breath. Literally, come on.

337
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:29,837
Now, then, is Mr. McNulty capable of having
a civil conversation with Mrs. McNulty?

338
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,881
Yes, Your Honor.

339
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:35,510
And is Mrs. McNulty equally capable
of having a conversation with Mr. McNulty?

340
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,180
- Yes.
- Good, then I'm going to lunch.

341
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,849
And let's see when I return
if we can't busy this court

342
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,978
with something just a little more engaging
than the problems of the McNultys.

343
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:51,276
Look, the charge is on me, I understand that,
I'll carry that, but the least our people can do

344
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,444
is to pay something
to the bondsman.

345
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,697
That's the deed of transfer
for the club.

346
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,617
And the other thing is the license transfer
application for the liquor board.

347
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:02,036
They're both backdated
and notarized to last week.

348
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,372
What?

349
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,250
A front has to be clean.

350
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:11,504
And right now, you ain't that.
Sign.

351
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,009
I want my bail paid.

352
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,053
You send me a bondsman,
I'll sign.

353
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,389
Is that what you want me
to tell him?

354
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,058
That I asked you to sign
and you wouldn't?

355
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,368
You wanted to be in the game, right?

356
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:45,872
Now you're in the game.

357
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,251
Unbelievable.
You show up with her?

358
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:54,756
You went for an emergency ex parte.
I took whatever lawyer was standing around.

359
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:59,427
She was standing?
Ask her if she wants the pictures back.

360
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:03,014
I've got her at the restaurant
with you pulling out her chair.

361
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:06,768
I've got her at the motel parking lot
with you opening the car door for her

362
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:10,271
- because you're such a gentleman now.
- I can't believe you hired Buckman.

363
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:15,109
- He never made a case that counted.
- He caught your cheating ass.

364
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:20,698
Elena, why are we here?

365
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:25,286
Because you can't have
Sean and Michael around criminals.

366
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,498
You can't lose them in a Baltimore
market. That's why.

367
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:29,957
He wasn't a criminal.

368
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:33,294
I know the guy.

369
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,588
It was a game we were playing.

370
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:40,301
It was daylight on a crowded street.
They could've been following Al Capone.

371
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:44,764
Elena, these are my sons.
I love them. Do you hear? I love them.

372
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,265
I'm not gonna let them get hurt.

373
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,146
I love you too.

374
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:55,983
Still do.

375
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:06,285
Does she know about
the detective and the pictures?

376
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,787
No, why would I tell her
about that?

377
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,041
And are the two of you
still...?

378
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:13,167
No.

379
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,716
Yes.

380
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,511
A little.

381
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,273
Come on,
let's make nice for the judge.

382
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,193
Okay.

383
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:48,411
We know we have a month more to go
and we're not gonna let up.

384
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:52,290
We are going to raise more,
we are going to spend more

385
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,209
and on Election Day,
we are going to be out there

386
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,587
pushing the vote in every precinct.

387
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,422
You ready?

388
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,180
Come on, we'll get dinner first.

389
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,682
Ain't so hungry.

390
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,394
Come on.

391
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:26,574
How much were you using?

392
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,747
I'm asking if you're gonna be
sick in my car.

393
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:35,833
A cap now and then.

394
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,211
You just snorting?

395
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,426
You'll be all right
in a day or two. Come on.

396
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,480
This nigger coming or what, man?

397
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,441
Said he would, if I guaranteed a parley.
And I'm here on it.

398
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,946
He said you would be paying my fee
rather than his own self.

399
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,907
- Your fee?
- I'm doing like a marriage counselor.

400
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,953
Charge by the hour to tell some fool
to bring some flowers home.

401
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:16,082
Then charge another hour telling the bitch
she ought to suck some cock once in a while.

402
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,626
You know,
keep a marriage strong like that.

403
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,588
Speaking of cocksuckers...

404
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,843
Don't believe we met.
Proposition Joe.

405
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,348
You ever steal from me,
I kill your whole family.

406
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:37,937
All right. You all both here on my guarantee,
so respect that shit and say what you feel.

407
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:40,231
I'm up out of here.

408
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,323
I got a man who say he gonna
give you your life back.

409
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:52,493
Who? Barksdale?

410
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:57,456
My man say, tell that motherfucker that
if he can find a way not to dip in our pockets

411
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,625
we gonna call this shit even.

412
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,838
Y'all aced Bailey,
and what you did to my boy?

413
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,135
Y'all think after what you did to Brandon
we supposed to find some even?

414
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:12,263
I don't know shit about shit, all right?
I'm just the messenger.

415
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,557
Whatever, man.

416
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:17,602
You know there's dead
on both sides, right?

417
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,605
There's gonna be a lot more
if this beef keep up.

418
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:24,942
But the truth be told, there be more soldiers
on one half than the other.

419
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:26,068
You know what I'm saying?

420
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,450
Look here, son,
you tell Barksdale

421
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,328
that he's been paid back
for what he did to my peoples.

422
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:39,040
But as for his product,
a man's got to earn a living, you know?

423
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,208
I don't know
nobody called Barksdale, B.

424
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:47,298
The man I'm talking about can't have
his shit taken like that. That won't do.

425
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:51,218
All right, tell him to throw me
some cash, then, and we'll see.

426
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,679
About five or ten thousand.

427
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,766
You know, for my retirement?

428
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,936
- Five if you can keep quiet about it.
- Send my money through Joe, man.

429
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,231
You go through Joe,
you're not gonna see 2,000 of that.

430
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,234
- Why don't you tell my man where you at?
- No.

431
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,737
We gonna figure something else out,
you hear?

432
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:12,782
I'll be in touch, homes.

433
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,081
How careful is Stringer Bell?

434
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,625
I don't know
no-one named Barksdale.

435
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:24,710
Shit.

436
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,545
Still, we got him tied to
the Brandon killing.

437
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,006
That can be enough
for one day's work.

438
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:40,351
Did what I could for y'all.

439
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,375
You sure, right?

440
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,669
Yeah, I spent a summer here
when I was nine.

441
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,047
When was the last time
they saw you?

442
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,341
When I was nine.

443
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,098
- What's that?
- What?

444
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:20,850
That noise.

445
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,144
It's crickets.

446
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,022
- Cricket.
- Crickets.

447
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:36,282
- He try to go in my pockets again?
- This nigger talking about five Gs, B.

448
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,492
Shit.

449
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,707
What's up, baby?

450
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,584
Antwon said to bring these up.
Anything else?

451
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:47,752
No, we cool.

452
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,337
I'm saying,
how we supposed to pay that?

453
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:53,674
He talking about going through Joe,
but I'm like, fuck Joe.

454
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,720
Thank you, my love,
you know what I mean?

455
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,722
You look good and
your services are appreciated.

456
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,433
Keep them tips.
I hope you making them, baby.

457
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:09,523
She makes the motherfucker come down
to the towers to get the rest of his money.

458
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:13,527
If he's stupid enough to come out
of the towers, he gonna get got.

459
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,030
It's a wrap.
How we supposed to pay that?

460
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:17,823
All right, all right.

461
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,873
Y'all think you can hang,
but look.

462
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,798
No, you see,
I went to journalism school.

463
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:36,884
All right? Northwestern.
So you all can't stay with me on this.

464
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,930
Girl, you talking like
you some crusty old reporter.

465
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,058
- Excuse me?
- Bitch, you work at a TV station.

466
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:48,687
It's the same thing, all right?
Look, come on, stop talking.

467
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,231
Here we go.

468
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:55,110
- Bring it.
- Come on, Kima.

469
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:58,989
I gotta work tomorrow.

470
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,410
Candy ass.

471
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,162
That's all I have to say.

472
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,960
- Okay, you see?
- I'm with you.

473
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,045
- All right.
- Look at Tanya.

474
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,047
And she run a damn art gallery.

475
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:19,593
You see, police in this town
ain't about shit.

476
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,265
- Guess not.
- Thank you.

477
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:26,934
Can't hold a liquor.

478
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,271
Can't hold a doughnut.

479
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:39,613
And if you ask me, I guess
we ain't good in bed either.

480
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,615
Oh, don't go there, Officer.

481
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,367
Don't go there.

482
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,123
Kima, how did you know
you wanted to be a cop?

483
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,251
I mean,
how did you choose that?

484
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:56,213
When you were little,
did you think about it at all or...?

485
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,092
Come on, Kima.

486
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:05,556
I remember when I was in the Northeast,
still field-training as a cadet.

487
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,142
I didn't know if I was
gonna stick with it or not.

488
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,644
And then we got this one call.

489
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:14,565
We chased this purse-snatcher
up into these apartments.

490
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,943
I got separated from my FTO.

491
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:20,195
Shit, I ain't even no police yet.

492
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:23,866
You know, I'm just a trainee.
And I'm alone.

493
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:30,789
Anyway, I mean,
I don't know how, but I find the guy.

494
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,502
So I catch him and I hold on to him
and I manage to get to my radio.

495
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,341
Now, we in the middle of this parking
lot and we're rolling around

496
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:43,344
and this motherfucker's steady
kicking my ass trying to get away.

497
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:49,683
I look over and I see these black patents
and these uniform blue pants.

498
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:54,063
I look up and it's Charlie Smoot.

499
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:59,485
Charlie fucking Smoot.
You know, this guy's a legend.

500
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,447
He looks down at me and he smiles,
you know, real quiet-like.

501
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,201
And he drops his cuffs.
He says, here you go, rook.

502
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,205
That's all he says.

503
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:13,958
Here you go, rook.

504
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,587
And then he dropped
the bracelets and walked away.

505
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,052
I mean,
I know you don't like it.

506
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,015
But shit, I was proud.

507
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,028
Goddamn.

508
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,619
Lester says we won't
write a warrant on this place.

509
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:36,540
- How do we not with all this PC?
- We're on the main stash, right?

510
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:40,878
Why kick the door in when all we have
to do is park a van down the street,

511
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,589
follow the entire Westside
drug supply in and out?

512
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:47,134
We're gonna pick up pieces of Barksdale's
world we never even knew about.

513
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,430
Been hell looking for you people.
What's the name of this unit anyway?

514
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,100
Oh, shit, Kima in the house.

515
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:59,730
What's up, Wig?
State police, CID, out of Pikesville.

516
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:03,567
Name of Troy Wiggins,
but pay no attention to the man

517
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:07,279
'cause he about 90-95%
pure bullshit.

518
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:10,991
Kima, she just talk like that
'cause I had her when she was good.

519
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:14,328
Shit, you the ugly-ass motherfucker
turned me the other way.

520
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:18,624
Shit, all right.
Here's the thing, boys and girls.

521
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:21,710
I'm doing a reverse buy-down
in Arundel, right?

522
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:24,880
And I get this Westside asshole
nibbling on four ounces.

523
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,674
- A whole four ounces?
- I know, he ain't much

524
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:30,511
but I get him in the boat
and he starts flopping around

525
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,430
saying he can buy weight from
some motherfucker, name of Barksdale.

526
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,643
I never heard of no Barksdale.
But I put the name into DECS.

527
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:42,189
And the computer has Avon Barksdale
entered as an active Baltimore city target.

528
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:46,443
So I go down to City Narcotics and Dawson,
he sends me down here to see y'all.

529
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,153
So what's the name of your fish?

530
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:50,739
Wendell O,

531
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:54,785
as in oh-shit-I-tried-to-buy
from-a-state-police, Blocker.

532
00:40:55,453 --> 00:41:00,249
- That wouldn't be Wendell Orlando Blocker?
- Yeah. You on it.

533
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,294
Orlando.

534
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:08,882
They keep that back room locked.
Even if I do get back there on an errand,

535
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,552
then they kind of shut down.
They get real quiet.

536
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,473
You said you heard one say something about
making someone come into the towers.

537
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,601
- Yeah.
- Which one was talking?

538
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,980
He was tall, I think.

539
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:25,107
All right, but who else was there?

540
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,696
I don't really see that well
without my glasses.

541
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:32,948
Where are your glasses?

542
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,414
You can't see faces
without those?

543
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,545
You don't wear those while you're working,
do you though?

544
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,549
Would you?
I gotta live off drinks and tips.

545
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,095
- No way.
- Why not?

546
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,347
Because a player wouldn't be
the name on the liquor license.

547
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:01,310
A player would have a connect
for Barksdale's coke.

548
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,604
He caught a charge
and now he's talking out his ass.

549
00:42:03,897 --> 00:42:06,732
Face it, you'll never get Avon or Stringer
in the same room as the dope.

550
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:11,069
- We make this case on their voices alone.
- So maybe he can't buy from Barksdale.

551
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:14,615
- Maybe it's only from Savino or Wee-Bey.
- Fuck him, then.

552
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:18,327
We already got Wee-Bey tied to a murder
and Savino's the runt of the litter.

553
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,460
We can take what Orlando
gives us about the club,

554
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,046
the money laundering maybe,
or the girls.

555
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,883
For that kind of cooperation,
I'll drop a few years and call it fair.

556
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:37,429
- Daniels in here?
- Yeah.

557
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:40,682
Call from Deputy Commissioner for you.
You want it in here?

558
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,977
No.

559
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:45,729
He doesn't miss much.

560
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,411
- I need some help here.
- Come on, Bubbs.

561
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,289
You get me across town
in the middle of a fucked-up workday

562
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:08,752
- just so you can hold 10...
- Hold on, I don't need 10. Okay?

563
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,172
I don't know.
I need a place of my own.

564
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,551
All right?
Some bed, some sheets, some clothes.

565
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,011
I definitely need some new clothes.

566
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:21,348
How long you been clean?

567
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:24,851
A few days.

568
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,438
You serious about it?

569
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:31,566
Who knows?

570
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:39,074
What the fuck am I gonna do with
a clean informant? Did you think about that?

571
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,541
All right, I'm on it with you.

572
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,044
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

573
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:55,924
What the fuck, give me some love.

574
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:00,887
Okay, I mean, I think I can get,
you know, a mattress, my own place,

575
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:02,973
everything for like a couple
hundred dollars.

576
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,394
All right. We'll talk.

577
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:11,189
I gotta be somewhere tonight,
so hit me on a page tomorrow.

578
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:14,526
Tomorrow?

579
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:16,903
I got you.

580
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:25,412
- The cooperator says he can buy weight.
- Not from Barksdale or Bell.

581
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:26,955
How can you be sure?

582
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:30,542
How much dope or coke do you think
gets Barksdale into the room?

583
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:33,670
A kilo? Two kilos? 20 kilos?

584
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:38,008
We are not going to buy our way
up the ladder.

585
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,469
These people do not touch the drugs.
They don't go near the drugs.

586
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:44,014
The wire is what gives us Barksdale.

587
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:45,974
It gives us the whole crew.

588
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:49,519
Day by day, piece by piece.

589
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,276
Buy-bust, Lieutenant.

590
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:02,074
It's what I asked you for months ago.
It's what we do successfully

591
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,951
time and again to make these cases.

592
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:14,336
Why New York?

593
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:20,300
Must be something happening out there.
It's a bigger town, you know what I mean?

594
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:23,011
- You don't believe the truce?
- That's why I asked for that money.

595
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:28,225
If he had said, we ain't paying, be happy to
live, I'd have been, like, they keeping it real.

596
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:31,186
But he say, come on down for $5,000.
I'm, like, man, please.

597
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:37,818
Look, homes, I ain't asked for much,
but I'm a little light on traveling money.

598
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:42,072
I could have gone round the block,
got myself paid, but I'm thinking.

599
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:49,204
You keep in touch with my pager.
We're gonna need you for the Gant trial.

600
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,416
Go easy, Omar.

601
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:58,547
Stay free.

602
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:05,345
You be picking me up outside
the cut-rate on Lex and Fulton.

603
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,182
- I'll be up there at the ten, right?
- That'll work.

604
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:11,560
Listen up, people.

605
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,647
We've got 30,000 in buy money,
courtesy of our friends at DEA.

606
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:18,733
But the thing is, they can't have
that money walking on them.

607
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,360
Definitely not.

608
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:24,197
So Kima will be in the car for the buy,
fronting as our CI's girl.

609
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:25,615
Looking the part too.

610
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:32,080
- Where's your weapon gonna be?
- He might pat me so it has to stash in the car.

611
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:35,834
I figure when Savino gets in the car
at the cut-rate, I'll be going in back.

612
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:37,669
It'll be up under the rear seat.

613
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,425
We probably can't be close enough for an
eyeball on this but the car will be a live wire.

614
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,553
And Kima will be throwing us
20s whenever she can. Rhonda.

615
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,972
I only want to remind
Mr. Blocker here

616
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:52,100
that his plea agreement
is contingent on cooperation.

617
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:55,562
And a buy-bust on Savino Bratton
is less cooperative

618
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,231
than a buy-bust higher up
on the food chain.

619
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:03,278
If you can get Savino talking about Avon
or Stringer, that's better for us and you.

620
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:06,281
They already know that
he got jacked on a reverse buy, right?

621
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,910
- Why wouldn't they assume he's snitching?
- I need money for a lawyer.

622
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:11,912
- Right?
- That's the story.

623
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,540
He got popped and now he needs
to get right back into it

624
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,083
to pay the bondsman
and the lawyer.

625
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,629
All right.
Let's make this work.

626
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,426
Careful. That's my career
you're holding there.

627
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,180
- You got a unit?
- In the mezzanine.

628
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,806
- Give me the keys, man.
- No, I'm driving.

629
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,185
Come on, man.

630
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,224
Death row here.

631
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:17,727
Ain't up.

632
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:20,480
Death row.

633
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:51,511
My girl.
Half the money hers.

634
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:06,943
Baby, since we going down
North Avenue,

635
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:09,362
stop by the carry-out
so I can pick me up some cigarettes.

636
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:11,156
They're going up North.
Stay loose.

637
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,498
Shit. It's too loud.

638
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:40,268
Does any unit have the eyeball?

639
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:43,021
Negative, 11-35.

640
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,650
Come on, Greggs,
tell us where the fuck you are.

641
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:49,903
Pull in there.

642
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:52,781
- What?
- Pull in there.

643
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,680
Don't fuck with this count.

644
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:20,975
I'll be right back
with your shit.

645
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:34,197
Where are we?

646
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:37,450
That sign said Longwood,
but I'm sure it's Warwick.

647
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:40,036
Hoppers be turning the signs
to fuck with you all.

648
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:47,085
I make it we're on the north side
of Warwick, in an alley...

649
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,214
I don't know, shit.
Half a block west of Longwood, maybe?

650
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:53,133
I hope you all copy that.

651
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:57,095
That puts us about eight blocks away.
I'm pushing in a little closer.

652
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:58,722
All units be advised.

653
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:02,434
Warwick near Longwood in the north
side alley. Or near that 20.

654
