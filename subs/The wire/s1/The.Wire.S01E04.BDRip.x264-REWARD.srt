1
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:20,687
Fuck me.

2
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:23,022
I'm dying here.

3
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:26,067
Let me get on the other side,
work it from there.

4
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,029
One, two.

5
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:31,280
Three.

6
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,959
Shit.

7
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,169
Need help?

8
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:54,512
- Right. On three, motherfuckers.
- One, two, three.

9
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,147
I'm embarrassed for you all.

10
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:11,028
Yo, Herc, I catch my breath,
I'm gonna shoot the drawers off this bitch.

11
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:13,239
It's caught on something,
Lieutenant.

12
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,950
Get over there with Carver.

13
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,172
One, two, you know what to do.

14
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,012
What the fuck?

15
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,484
Jesus. My ass is kicked.

16
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:53,613
I could move it a bit when I was alone.
It must've got wedged in the door somehow.

17
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,156
Desk is empty, right?

18
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,325
- Yeah.
- You checked it?

19
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,371
At this rate,
we're never gonna get it in.

20
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,463
What?

21
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,256
In?

22
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,092
In.

23
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:19,096
Unbelievable,
unbe-fucking-lievable.

24
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,392
Christ.

25
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:45,289
<i>If you walk through the garden</i>

26
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:48,084
<i>You better watch your back</i>

27
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,588
<i>Well I beg your pardon</i>

28
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,424
<i>Walk the straight
and narrow track</i>

29
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,679
<i>If you walk with Jesus</i>

30
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,016
<i>He'll save your soul</i>

31
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,770
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

32
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,231
<i>Down in the hole</i>

33
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,694
<i>All the angels sing</i>

34
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,322
<i>About Jesus' mighty sword</i>

35
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,118
<i>And they'll shield you
with their wings</i>

36
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:26,789
<i>Keep you close to the Lord</i>

37
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,834
<i>Don't pay heed to temptation</i>

38
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:34,338
<i>For his hands are so cold</i>

39
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,301
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

40
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,846
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

41
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,398
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

42
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,277
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

43
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:01,115
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

44
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,076
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

45
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,548
This case is a bit
humble for you.

46
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:21,344
I know it doesn't look like much
on paper, but see what you can do.

47
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,396
- Making new friends?
- Not yet.

48
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,108
I spent the morning down
in juvenile court

49
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:40,947
but the kids know they can't be hurt with
a street-weight charge so didn't get much.

50
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,073
You tried, huh?

51
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:45,743
Nothing like being told,
fuck off, by a 14-year-old.

52
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,829
- Right here's our best shot.
- Him?

53
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,210
Hand-to-hand with Bubbles
and he's carrying a long-ass sheet.

54
00:04:54,294 --> 00:05:00,257
- All right. Who's first? Ms. Dawkins?
- State versus Marvin Browning, Your Honor.

55
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:03,386
One count distribution
of a controlled substance, heroin,

56
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,722
and one count distribution
of a controlled substance, cocaine.

57
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,558
- Quantity?
- One gelcap and one vial, Your Honor.

58
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,769
Bail recommendation?

59
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,815
That defendant be held,
as he is part of a continuing investigation

60
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,695
and is subject to a mandatory five years
without parole because of prior convictions.

61
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:24,907
- Will your office seek the mandatory five?
- Absolutely, Your Honor.

62
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:29,078
Very well, I'll take that
into consideration.

63
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,749
Got his attention, at least.

64
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,550
Lieutenant, come have a taste.

65
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,261
Come on, we're celebrating.

66
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:51,851
- Patrick's going out on medical.
- Sweet, sweet Cervical 6.

67
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,604
My shoulder's numb,
my arm's numb.

68
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,941
My fingers feel like they belong
to some son of a bitch in the next county.

69
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,862
This is my ticket
out of this rat-shit department.

70
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:07,241
66 and two-thirds pension
and I don't have to wait for my 30.

71
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,702
- I'm gone.
- Fucking yo did you a favor.

72
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,704
Kid hit like a mule,
I've got to say.

73
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,458
You should take a couple of days.
Think it over.

74
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,961
My brother-in-law's got
a video store out on Moravia.

75
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:23,424
Does $6,000 a week straight rentals,
another $8,000 in porn.

76
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,842
He needs a partner.

77
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,178
But they take that off
a medical pension.

78
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:31,057
If you report it as income, they do.
Do I look that fucking stupid?

79
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,142
Have a nice life, Lieutenant.

80
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,030
What's with you?

81
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,366
You gonna miss me, Augs?

82
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,619
What the fuck am I going
to do, Paddy?

83
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,246
Tell you what.

84
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:57,416
- What do you say we go out together?
- What do you mean?

85
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:01,587
I mean, it only hurts for a minute.
And it doesn't have to be line of duty either.

86
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,591
I'm serious. You know those stairs
where they send us down to the basement?

87
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,843
- Yeah.
- It's dark down there.

88
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:12,098
You go up eight or nine steps,
let go of the rail, take a little jump...

89
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,976
- I'd break my fucking neck like that.
- You don't break nothing.

90
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:20,606
You do a little dance on those steps,
you're up to two-thirds with me.

91
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,317
And maybe you sue the city,
get a little more.

92
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,197
Can't say we don't deserve it.

93
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,742
Five in.

94
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,619
For a one-and-one.

95
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,122
Why bang me like that
for a one-and-one?

96
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,750
It's your turn, Mr. Browning.
Everybody out there gets a turn.

97
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:45,089
You're all running wild here. A judge
might want to slow you all down a mite.

98
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,843
I don't know, Marvin.
I'm looking at your sheet here and...

99
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,514
For one thing, it's a little
wrong to be calling it a sheet.

100
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,723
More like a book.

101
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,518
We got the room to get
a little crazy on you.

102
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,645
Like she said, it's your turn.

103
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,524
Tell us some stories,
it could be somebody else's turn.

104
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,861
Stories...

105
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,654
Avon Barksdale.

106
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,199
Know the name?

107
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:15,035
Every motherfucker up in them
towers know the name.

108
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,538
But I ain't never had
a word with the man.

109
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,415
Stringer Bell then?

110
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,378
Wee-Bey? Savino? Stinkum?
CCO? Roc-Roc?

111
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,965
Well who you gonna give us,
Marvin?

112
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:32,094
You don't say a name soon,
you're gonna be courtside.

113
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,387
All right.

114
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,265
All right? All right what?

115
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,601
All right, I'll take the years.

116
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,948
Damn, boy.

117
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,161
You should see the cop.

118
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,247
When you're ready to get up,
put that on.

119
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:03,834
- Report to bunk A-7.
- A-7.

120
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,128
Don't be later than breakfast.

121
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,547
Hey.

122
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:13,177
Who else is up in here?
Anybody from Westside?

123
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,888
DC boys, mostly.

124
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,941
Long fucking drive.
Me and you drawing another shit detail.

125
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,777
- This ain't a shit detail.
- No?

126
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:57,906
I'm in Upper fucking Marlboro, Maryland,
and still going south.

127
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,659
Look. Another cow.

128
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,831
Use your imagination.

129
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,335
This little shitbird,
having been whipped good by us once,

130
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,379
he sees us and he starts
crying like a little bitch

131
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:16,300
cause he knows we drove all the way
to Prince George's for more of his ass.

132
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:20,804
Imagine we jack him up,
toss him into a small room...

133
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,850
And tell him Detective Mahone
is near dead from the sucker punch.

134
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,812
No shit. The drunk old fuck
suddenly slipped into a coma.

135
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:32,524
The Commissioner and Mrs. Mahone
are at his bedside in the ICU.

136
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:37,446
And we've been ordered to come down here,
rip off his scrotum, put it in a jar

137
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,949
and drive it back to Baltimore
to sit with the bowling trophies

138
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,285
behind the bar
at the FOP Lodge.

139
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,289
All right? After which...

140
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,417
Fucknuts stops whimpering
long enough

141
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,462
to just start giving
people up, whoever.

142
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,924
Stringer Bell.
Avon Barksdale.

143
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,759
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

144
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,388
Little prick turns on everybody

145
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,973
and we break the case wide open.

146
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,810
- Cool.
- Right?

147
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:28,330
So from all them hand-to-hands,
nobody flipped?

148
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,542
No, that part of town,
Barksdale carries more weight than us.

149
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,753
Just like all these
fucking homicides.

150
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:38,590
Witnesses lying, paid off,
backing up on their story.

151
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,969
- Can you blame them?
- Not really.

152
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,681
Every now and then, we visit
the projects. They live there.

153
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,225
- Your man's D?
- D'Angelo, yeah.

154
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,728
This one's got a D
as a possible shooter.

155
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:55,023
- This one connects.
- No way.

156
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,067
Yeah. I'm seeing it.

157
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:03,157
- Diedre Kresson, one of Keeley's cases.
- Come on, Jay, this is a college girl

158
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,367
blown up in an apartment
up in Northeast.

159
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,995
How does it match
with the other Westside mopes?

160
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,873
- They don't have cars?
- It doesn't match.

161
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:15,794
It does. Look at your office report. A witness
puts her with a D the night she's aced.

162
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,506
How many Ds do you think there are
in the system? As a street name?

163
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:24,803
Let me ask you something, Jimmy. How
many case files are you putting on Barksdale?

164
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,764
- Maybe a dozen.
- A dozen cases.

165
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,392
So, how many of those
are from our squad?

166
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,770
One. Gerard Bogue.

167
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:37,983
One case? Your squad's down
a man for weeks, Jimmy.

168
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,028
We're gonna be humping your calls,
catching your cases,

169
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:45,699
hopping around like a one-legged pig-town
whore on cheque day and for what?

170
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:50,245
So you can have your big adventure and solve
everybody else's cases? Is this what I hear?

171
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,164
He's got you, Jimmy.

172
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,793
Where's the love, McNulty?
Show me some fucking love.

173
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,838
- All right.
- Attaboy.

174
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,924
He's my son.

175
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:12,476
Why not dump this loser on Santangelo?
He's meant to be helping us anyway.

176
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,022
I would if I could find the fucker.
Must have another job, he's gone so much.

177
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,484
- What does Daniels say about that?
- Nothing, I cover for him.

178
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,986
He was out in the wind
all day yesterday, half the day before.

179
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,406
Man, Keeley really dogged
this one.

180
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:30,577
Ain't nothing in here but a 24
and some crime scene photos, and this.

181
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:35,958
Tywanda called.
NFD, no last name, no address.

182
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:40,379
Claims your victim killed after
being visited by a suspect named D.

183
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,674
No further description.

184
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,385
There's a callback
number though.

185
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:47,678
So call.

186
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,908
The number you have reached
has been disconnected.

187
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,493
Disconnected.

188
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,080
He got you, Jimmy.

189
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,958
All right, motherfucker,
he got me too.

190
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:22,754
So, I'm gonna call Verizon,
see if they got a fresh listing.

191
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,215
You happy now, bitch?

192
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,845
You sure about that tag, Bubs?

193
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,930
I seen the van.

194
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:35,017
It cleared the Court
and rolled up Amity toward Lexington.

195
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,604
Plates were reported stolen
off a car parked on this block.

196
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,064
So you're thinking
they're from right around here?

197
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,275
Maybe.

198
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,944
Word in the Towers
said it was Omar and his crew.

199
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:50,532
- Omar? Who's he?
- You ain't know Omar?

200
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:54,745
Omar the terror. Been ripping and robbing
out here for years now.

201
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,705
- Is he fierce?
- That nigger don't play.

202
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,459
- Got a last name?
- Just Omar.

203
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:01,710
He don't need no last name.

204
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,962
Who's his family?

205
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:07,424
You remember No-Heart Anthony?
Came up with him. They brothers.

206
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,426
No-Heart Anthony?

207
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,764
Miss Kima, do not tell me
you don't remember No-Heart Anthony.

208
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,352
Damn, girl. What town
you been policing at all these years?

209
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,398
And right now, I am personally
ashamed to be your snitch.

210
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,654
- Shit.
- What?

211
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,573
- I'm late for my class.
- Class?

212
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,993
- 12-14?
- 12-14.

213
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:39,706
Requesting anyone in my unit
who's up to report to Channel 13.

214
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,416
35, I got that.

215
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,009
Package be moving.

216
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,261
Avon's stuff always be good.

217
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,389
It's a sweet score?

218
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,974
It's all right.

219
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,352
That play was a little bit
raggedy in there though.

220
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,022
I fucked up, I know.

221
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,775
Letting go your name.

222
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,860
I don't really care
you shouted me out.

223
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,113
Everybody in these projects
been knowing Omar.

224
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,450
I just don't want them
coming down on you, baby boy.

225
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,583
Shirley coming with her game.

226
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:27,963
- Every fucking day with that shit.
- Mr. Omar?

227
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,466
My cheque late.

228
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,567
Yo, Mike.

229
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,736
Hook a sister up, yo.

230
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,495
So, what next, yo?

231
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,039
Got some irons.

232
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:07,419
Think about working the flush-and-run
on the Eastside till things cool a mite.

233
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,504
That'll work.

234
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,134
- So you don't want to lay over here tonight?
- No.

235
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,471
- Sure?
- No, I'm gonna go see my mom.

236
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:22,350
- Keep it close.
- I hear that.

237
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,239
Who the man?

238
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,254
Hey. I gotta be somewhere first
but I'll run him back after.

239
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,591
No problem.
Thanks for answering.

240
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,887
- Bubs.
- McNulty.

241
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,226
What's up?

242
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,604
You ever heard of No-Heart Anthony?

243
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:13,944
Who, Anthony Little?
1058 Argyle, Apartment 16J.

244
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:17,155
He's in Hagerstown on a robbery bit.
What about him?

245
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,865
My man.

246
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,078
Fuck y'all.

247
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:30,168
You know how the cracker motherfuckers do
when they kill a deer?

248
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,796
Or when they go out
killing animals?

249
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:38,260
Got them on the front of the truck, tied up,
stretched out, so everybody could see it.

250
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,929
You feel me?

251
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:43,932
I'm serious.
That's what I want.

252
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,059
I want that motherfucker
on display.

253
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,437
I'll send a message to the courtyard
about this motherfucker

254
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,189
so people know we ain't playing.

255
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,441
Yeah, we got peoples on it.

256
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,361
You tell them
it's 1,000 on the bucks

257
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,238
and it's a deuce on Omar.

258
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,700
- Yeah, Bird's on it.
- Savino too.

259
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,412
You know, Bird jailed
with Omar down the cut.

260
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,539
He said he all faggot.

261
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,833
A faggot?
Get the fuck out of here.

262
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,627
Said he had a whole stable of boys
down in Jessup.

263
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:16,131
This motherfucker got even less use
for pussy now that he home.

264
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:19,384
So, he gotta a lotta heart
for a cocksucker?

265
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:23,388
Yo, yo, we doubling down on Sweet Lips,
all right?

266
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,433
We make it four motherfucking
thousand dollars on him.

267
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,477
Six if I get the chance
to holler at him before he get got.

268
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,480
- Say no more.
- Take care of all that.

269
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,401
Stick-up come up dead
on the stash one night.

270
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:40,488
- Police jumping out the next.
- Something up at the Pit?

271
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,866
Maybe, yeah.

272
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,244
What's up with my nephew?

273
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:49,497
I don't know.
He making that money out the hole, but...

274
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,459
He might have a problem
he don't know about.

275
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,380
I'm on it.

276
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:11,436
Yo, where in Leave It To Beaver-land
are you taking me?

277
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,146
I'm late for something.

278
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,731
I'll drop you after,
on the way back downtown.

279
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,234
- What you late for?
- Soccer.

280
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,654
Suck what?

281
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,292
Get in the goal!

282
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,714
Spread it out, spread it out.
There you go.

283
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,728
First team, fall in!

284
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:59,275
- Dad!
- Mikey, how are you?

285
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,820
- Who's winning?
- They are, 4-1.

286
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,822
4-1?
Who got the goal for you guys?

287
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:07,534
- Ricardo, my assist.
- Assist? That's good.

288
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,871
You've got to drink on the breaks.
Don't get dehydrated.

289
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:15,208
- Hey.
- Hey.

290
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,293
This is Bubbles.

291
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,630
- Hi.
- Second team, come on!

292
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:22,924
Go on, Mike. Go get 'em.

293
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:30,056
You're late. He thought you
weren't gonna come this time either.

294
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:32,058
This job, you know this job.

295
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,936
I can't get out here
when he gets off the bus at four.

296
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,857
I need more than every other weekend.
He needs me more.

297
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,692
No more weekends.

298
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,944
50-50 split's all my lawyer
says I have to give.

299
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,405
It's not 50-50
if I don't see him all week.

300
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,825
- You see him every day.
- Don't curse. My lawyer says...

301
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,286
Fuck your lawyer.

302
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,705
Fuck you. Fuck you.

303
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,296
- Did you see?
- Yeah, I saw.

304
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,590
I saw.

305
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,675
Come on, you get out.

306
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,445
This good for you?

307
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,535
Thin line between heaven and here.

308
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,489
How did he know where the stash at?
The knockos don't know, but he do?

309
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,366
Cause some nigger's snitching.

310
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,912
Ain't nobody got to be snitching for Omar
to creep by and see where the stash at.

311
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:21,334
- Damn, Bodie. Fucked that nigger up.
- They stomped his ass.

312
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,587
How he ain't courtside
for banking a knocko?

313
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,258
Boy, how you get home so quick?

314
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,387
Nigger, what you steal?

315
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:36,141
Camry XLE. You all want a ride?
It's right around the corner.

316
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,436
Man, Boy's Village ain't shit.

317
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:43,982
I'm just too bad for that
off-brand, little-boy bullshit, man.

318
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:45,358
It can't hold me.

319
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,572
What you laughing at?
What's so funny?

320
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:55,326
If you was me,
your ass would still be down there.

321
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,414
You ever seen a city
jail, nigger?

322
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:04,419
You ever caught a body?
I'm the one who just got home, remember?

323
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,005
Eight months on Eager Street
with a body on me.

324
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,507
- You got the one.
- The one you know about.

325
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:12,177
You little motherfuckers need
to ask around.

326
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:18,641
Yo, out near the county, right,
on the high end of the Eastside,

327
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,978
they got these apartments
out there, right?

328
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,148
So there was this little shorty
who used to stay out there.

329
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,067
She was, like... phew.

330
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,528
I mean...

331
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:33,156
I ain't seen a female
that fine since.

332
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,241
I gotta say, shorty was right.

333
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:37,952
You fucked her?

334
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,662
No, man, it wasn't like that.

335
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:45,919
This was a shorty my uncle was messing with.
They was going on at it for a little while

336
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:49,130
till she find out my uncle
got another shorty round the way.

337
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,884
He got a few of them around the way.
Know what I'm saying?

338
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:58,389
She goes off talking about calling the police
about shit she ain't meant to know about.

339
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,642
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah, you know it.

340
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,813
But see, I got some creep to me.
And my uncle, he know that shit.

341
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,442
So they roll me out
past her crib.

342
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:14,197
And they show me how she lives
right on the ground floor, first level.

343
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,325
You know.

344
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,411
I go creeping around the back,
to the back window.

345
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,997
I got the .45 on me,
the big gun.

346
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,252
I walk up to the window and I look in
and it's dark as shit

347
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,837
because it's 3:00 a.m.
and you can't see shit.

348
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:32,757
What did you do?

349
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,969
So I pulled out the piece

350
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,764
and I start tapping with the back of it
on the window.

351
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:44,060
And it was quiet, but it was loud enough
so she could hear that shit.

352
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,438
Tap, tap, tap.

353
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,859
That's what she heard, yo.
Sure enough, she comes out.

354
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:54,279
She's naked and shit.

355
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,699
I don't know why the fuck,
but she has a robe

356
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,535
and as she slipping on her robe,
she turns on the light

357
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,372
and when she does that,
and it's light on the inside

358
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,083
she can't see shit
on the outside.

359
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,668
Damn.

360
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,253
She naked.

361
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,423
Tap, tap, tap.

362
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:18,720
She hears that shit on the window and
she ain't got no choice but to see what it is.

363
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,390
She steps up...

364
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,935
Looks out,
to see where it's coming from.

365
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,026
What happened?

366
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,488
He shot her?

367
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:45,621
Yo, D, if she was all that,
why didn't you fuck her first?

368
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,833
- Nigger, you sick, just shut up.
- What?

369
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,586
Something is seriously wrong.

370
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,511
This is ridiculous.

371
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:04,557
Because a lab freezer goes out
with an electrical short,

372
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,727
blood samples in 56 homicides,

373
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:11,356
15 rapes, are allowed to putrefy.

374
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,193
- State's attorney knows?
- The Mayor too.

375
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:20,114
Most of our trace lab is now
25 years old.

376
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,785
You ever go outside for money?
The non-profits?

377
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:25,870
Such as?

378
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:29,290
The Abell Foundation, for one.
My brother's on the board.

379
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,126
You want me to run it
up there for you?

380
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,630
- You could swing that?
- Never hurts to ask, does it?

381
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:39,675
It never does, Your Honor.

382
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,553
So, in that same spirit...

383
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,680
Where are we with
the Barksdale probe?

384
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,266
Oh, well...

385
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:49,560
My other reason for stopping by.

386
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:59,821
Hand-to-hands and search-and-seizures.
I heard about these.

387
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,240
Some mid-level players caught up.

388
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:07,161
Look, it's not a knockout blow
but we sent a clear message.

389
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,249
I don't see Barksdale's
name anywhere,

390
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,918
or Bell, or anything
about the murders.

391
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,087
The casework,
it goes towards that.

392
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,797
No.

393
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,426
So we've got work to do.

394
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,344
Don't we?

395
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:35,440
Police, open the damn door!

396
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:38,109
- Open the damn door.
- Open the door.

397
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,321
- What?
- Open the motherfucking door!

398
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,295
- Upstairs front clear.
- Kitchen's clear.

399
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,547
I'm at the back door.

400
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,759
- Anybody pop out here?
- OK, quiet.

401
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:05,803
Upstairs rear, clear.

402
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,848
I'll beat this bitch
like a red-headed stepchild

403
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,142
for hiding up
in this pisshole.

404
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,686
Goddamn creepy crawlies
everywhere.

405
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,064
Tell Bodie we're on his ass.

406
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:34,999
I'm sorry for cursing
at the door.

407
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,169
I mean, I couldn't see
that it was only you.

408
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,962
Is it the drugs again?

409
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,634
Would you like to sit down?

410
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:50,431
Preston came to me
when my daughter died.

411
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,518
He was four years old.

412
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:57,438
But even then,
I knew he was angry.

413
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,859
His mother lived out there,
caught up in it.

414
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:06,531
After a while, you couldn't
make her see nothin' else.

415
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,659
No, man, that wasn't us.

416
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:13,955
- 2:30 in the Towers? You're crazy.
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.

417
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:18,000
So how you think
you gonna carry it?

418
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:19,752
I'm sorry, ma'am.

419
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,296
And I'm sorry for the way
we came through here.

420
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,343
If Preston comes past...

421
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,388
Give him this

422
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:33,474
and tell him
we need to talk, OK?

423
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,812
I'm sorry.

424
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:48,531
- What the fuck you doing in there?
- Talking.

425
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,492
- Talking?
- Yeah.

426
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,749
- See you later.
- Catch you later.

427
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,736
Yeah?

428
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,448
McNulty.

429
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,701
Some judge for you.

430
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:40,666
Yeah.

431
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,004
Look, can I call you back?

432
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,555
- Major, Sir?
- Yeah.

433
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,934
I've been thinkin'.

434
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:02,647
It's a clear violation of the general
orders, I know, but...

435
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,156
Last night, I'm at home.
I'm sittin' up butt naked

436
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,036
and I got one hand wrapped around
a cold, domestic beer...

437
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,207
And the other around my magnificent,
flaccid four-and-one-half-inch wonder

438
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:24,293
and I am trying
with all my might

439
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:28,130
to remember what Leila Kaufman's
nipples looked like

440
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:32,009
when her bathing top slipped off
at the Hillendale pool swim party.

441
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:35,346
- Leila Kaufman?
- Yes, sir.

442
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,765
Summer of '72.

443
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:42,186
I got this saucy wench in my
gun-sights, so to speak,

444
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,023
and I am dangerously...

445
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:49,110
Close to engorged...

446
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,988
When all of a fuckin' sudden,
out of nowhere,

447
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:57,410
fuckin' Detective fuckin' Jimmy McNulty
pops into my head.

448
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:58,494
McNulty?

449
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:02,415
Obviously, I gotta admit to myself
that my whole night is ruined.

450
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:07,461
At which point, I got nothing to do but
think about the problems of Jimmy McNulty.

451
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:10,005
Because clearly this guy

452
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:14,093
and his fuckin' problems are standing
between me and all worldly pleasure.

453
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,803
Clearly.

454
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:19,348
First of all,
it's not Jimmy's fault.

455
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,601
- No?
- No.

456
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:25,020
Jimmy is an addict, sir.

457
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:27,481
What's he addicted to?

458
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,316
Himself.

459
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,403
It's not funny, sir.

460
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:36,031
As a matter of fact,
it's a fuckin' tragedy is what it is.

461
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,242
The guy,
he has come to believe

462
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,036
that he is always the smartest
fuck in the room.

463
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:45,249
And you know what? It's not his fault.
Let's face it.

464
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:51,088
He's not joining Mensa. He's taken a fuckin'
job with the Baltimore Police Department.

465
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:54,258
His first two years in Homicide,
he's in Ulmansky's squad

466
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,594
partnered with Tony Lamartino.

467
00:34:56,678 --> 00:35:00,431
Christ,
it must've been months even!

468
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,767
He was the smartest fuck
in the fuckin' room.

469
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:04,602
What's your point, Jay?

470
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:08,898
My point is, he can't help it.

471
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,610
It makes him an asshole, I know,

472
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:16,530
but it's also what
makes him good police.

473
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:23,078
Last year,
he gives me eight clearances.

474
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:28,042
One of them
was a decomp floater

475
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,044
who was John Doe
for three weeks.

476
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:44,642
Tell your boy to wrap up that
bullshit detail in two weeks.

477
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:47,561
He does that,
he comes home, clean slate.

478
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:07,623
You'd have loved it. Burrell is sitting
there with a handful of street-level arrests

479
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,458
pretending he has a plan.

480
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:11,293
So, what did you tell him?

481
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:15,631
Never shit a shitter, Deputy.
That's what I fuckin' told him.

482
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:19,385
- I did good, right, Jimmy?
- I gotta go.

483
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:32,815
Discuss the Hicks ruling
as a manifestation

484
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:36,360
of the judiciary's attempt
to maintain a speedy disposition

485
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,697
of criminal cases
within a modern court system.

486
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,199
What?

487
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,660
That's what I said.

488
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,495
What?

489
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,706
What the hell's
the Hicks ruling?

490
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,208
Did you highlight my sofa?

491
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:55,254
- What? No.
- Yes, you did.

492
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,797
That was there before.

493
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:59,675
Hell it was. Damn, Kima,
marker does not come out.

494
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:03,762
- No, I didn't do it, I swear.
- OK, let me see the marker.

495
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,850
You want my marker,
I need to see a warrant.

496
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,227
I'm serious.
I need to see a probable cause.

497
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:13,063
I'm gonna beat your ass.
That's a probable cause.

498
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:17,860
- Give me the marker.
- Damn, gettin' all violent and shit.

499
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:22,823
- You just violated my civil rights.
- That's it, new rule. No marker on the couch.

500
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,618
You get over to that table
and do your homework.

501
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:28,662
Go. Take it and go.

502
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,748
Gimme my marker.

503
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:46,013
I'm gonna need some
club soda.

504
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,307
Damn, girl...

505
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,684
This cellphone bill must
eat up the paycheck.

506
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,562
No, most of that's work.
It's on the company.

507
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,323
Phelan won't let go.

508
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,493
Are we anywhere close
on Barksdale?

509
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:11,121
- No, sir.
- So what are you telling me?

510
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:14,625
I'm not telling you anything, Sir.
I'm waiting for you to tell me.

511
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,461
I can do whatever
you need me to do.

512
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,089
If you want me to push it further,
I can do that.

513
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,507
If you want it to go away...

514
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:28,722
If you wanna bring in someone else,
maybe do things differently.

515
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:34,478
You looking for the back door,
Lieutenant? Already?

516
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,691
McNulty says this case
needs a wire.

517
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,318
You think he's right?

518
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,407
It needs somethin'.

519
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,211
Just climb your ass
up the pole.

520
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,755
No, man. This'll work.

521
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,094
I'm not climbin'
no damn ladder.

522
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:12,099
You never gonna hit it, man.

523
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,308
Bomb!

524
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:16,103
- Housing must think we just dumb.
- Is that...

525
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,605
- That's your pager or mine?
- That's me.

526
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:24,153
- Watch that shit on my head.
- It ricocheted off the fuckin' camera.

527
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,697
Yeah, you need some aim.

528
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,177
Yo, who this?

529
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:11,366
- So what do you think?
- Title three?

530
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:16,121
Right, but it's not for a wiretap.
It's to clone a pager. I got it from Pearlman.

531
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:19,708
- Pagers?
- Some kind of throwback thing.

532
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:23,420
- You mean, why not cellphones?
- Right. Who uses pagers anymore?

533
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,758
Tell you what, I was checking out
a wireless bill last night.

534
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:30,427
Every incoming call was listed.

535
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:34,348
Right. So, if we get Barksdale's pager,
we might get off the street.

536
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,391
Maybe even trace some supply.

537
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,981
So who's No-Heart Anthony?

538
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,735
No-Heart ran drugs in the homes
in the early '90s.

539
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,445
So, a couple years back,

540
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:52,157
he's in Randallstown,
tryin' to take off a jewelry store.

541
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:55,994
He fucks it up. Half the county
chases him back downtown.

542
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,081
I guess No-Heart figures
he's not up for doing the time

543
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:02,543
cause he puts a .44 against his chest,
pulls the trigger.

544
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,419
A .44?

545
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,131
It's a contact wound.

546
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:10,259
Wakes up two hours later
in the University ER.

547
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:13,011
- With a new nickname.
- Right.

548
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:19,560
Bubbles says Anthony's brother took off
with the Barksdale stash the other night.

549
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:21,812
Dude named Omar.

550
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:25,983
It's not the easiest trade, you know,
robbin' dealers.

551
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,487
A man like that
is likely to have a weapon on him.

552
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:33,991
We jack him up.
There's a charge to work off.

553
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,786
And if he knows
where the Barksdale stash is

554
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:39,955
he probably knows
a whole lot more.

555
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,499
See? Another plan.

556
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:02,186
The thing is,
we're gonna have to sell this.

557
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:06,773
- You wanna raise it with Daniels?
- He'll listen to you more than me.

558
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:14,948
Where's Santangelo?

559
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,993
Oh, he's at ECU.
He's got a case going today.

560
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:23,373
I haven't heard anything
to the contrary, so...

561
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,251
We're gonna press on.

562
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:30,505
Ideas?

563
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,842
We could continue
with the busts.

564
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:38,639
But that's not gonna get us
too far off the street.

565
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,059
On the other hand, the people
we pulled in last week had pagers.

566
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:45,270
So did D'Angelo Barksdale
when McNulty jacked him up.

567
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:48,065
We could clone
a couple of pagers.

568
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:50,150
- Clone what?
- Their pagers.

569
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:54,821
They get beeped, we get beeped.
We see who's calling, from what number.

570
00:42:55,323 --> 00:43:00,160
If they're all that, why they still using pagers?
Why not un-ass a few dollars for cellphones?

571
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:02,162
It's a discipline.

572
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,583
You can't bug a pager.

573
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:09,670
But you can't make
a call either.

574
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:13,548
You're gonna want a pen register
on all the pay phones in the low-rises

575
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:16,510
and any other phones
that link to the pagers.

576
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:19,137
What would it take to do
the pagers?

577
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:21,139
A wiretap affidavit.

578
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:25,477
We got enough PC from the hand-to-hands
and surveillance. We got the exhaustion.

579
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,980
- I'm exhausted just listening to this shit.
- Good.

580
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:32,901
Exhaustion is a legal requirement
for using electronic intercepts.

581
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,945
We gotta prove
nothing else works.

582
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,614
See, we made the arrests,
but nobody flipped.

583
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:40,909
We don't have an informant
who takes us above the street.

584
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:42,327
That's exhaustion.

585
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:46,873
All we got left to do is follow one
of these mopes and prove we can't do it.

586
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:51,128
We show a judge we can't make the case
by following these guys, and we can't.

587
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,630
How can we keep on any of them
in those towers?

588
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:55,507
But you gotta show you tried.

589
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,388
Do we have a pager number?

590
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:12,983
This was written on
the stash house wall

591
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,568
with the letter D
next to it.

592
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,947
Is that D'Angelo?
Did you check it?

593
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:20,907
It's him.

594
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:36,840
Let's do this.

595
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:45,515
What does he want us to do?
I don't understand.

596
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,852
I'll explain it to you
if you buy me breakfast.

597
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,660
Explain again why I'm about
to rework a six-month-old crime scene.

598
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:08,372
Look at this narrow-ass file.
Keeley didn't do shit.

599
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:11,375
- He did the scene.
- We're talking about Keeley.

600
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,543
Fucking Jay and his leaps of logic.

601
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:17,798
- This case is nowhere near what we're doing.
- Give it a shake or two anyhow.

602
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:20,634
- Make a sergeant happy.
- Whatever.

603
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,552
Do you know Lester Freamon?

604
00:45:23,845 --> 00:45:25,055
A little. Why?

605
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:29,017
- He's with us on this Barksdale thing.
- I thought they gave you humps.

606
00:45:29,102 --> 00:45:34,064
He looks like a hump, he acts like a hump,
sittin' there, playing with his toy furniture.

607
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:37,692
Jimmy, he makes more money off of that
shit than you do off of this job.

608
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:40,195
- Don't let Lester fool you.
- He did already.

609
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:44,574
- Today in roll call, he showed something.
- Hey, he's natural police.

610
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,701
He used to be Homicide.

611
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:49,496
- Why did he leave?
- Ask him.

612
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:55,085
- This is the one, huh?
- Yup. Hasn't been rented since.

613
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:09,433
Aw, fuck.

614
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:14,563
Motherfucker.

615
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,614
Fuck.

616
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,032
Fucking fuck.

617
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:29,661
Fuck.

618
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,128
Fuck.

619
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:40,672
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

620
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:47,471
What the fuck?

621
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:56,730
Fuck.

622
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:05,405
Fuck.

623
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,477
- No.
- Fuck.

624
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:47,197
Fuck it.

625
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:49,741
Oh, the fuck.

626
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,042
Motherfuck.

627
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,968
Fuck. Oh, fuck.

628
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:22,983
Fuckity, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

629
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:24,609
Fucker.

630
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,322
Oh, fuck.

631
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,242
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

632
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:45,839
Motherfucker.

633
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,176
Fuckin' A.

634
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:08,862
Fuck.

635
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:21,875
Check this.

636
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:23,918
Motherfucker.

637
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,465
Fuck me.

638
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:57,369
Pow.

639
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:43,164
Sydnor's on foot,
Carv's in the car.

640
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:46,960
Herc, you need to be
on top of the roof behind Amity.

641
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:49,921
Again, I get the shit detail?

642
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:52,048
The plan is to stay on D'Angelo.

643
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,468
- If we lose him, we lose him, right?
- We're gonna lose him.

644
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:59,931
You can't follow people in them towers
or hang in the low-rises without a reason.

645
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:02,475
Just to make sure,
we want to lose him, right?

646
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,227
Losin' him is good?

647
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:06,354
Right.

648
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:07,897
Then why the fuck do this?

649
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:11,317
Come on, Herc.
Roll with me on this one.

650
00:51:24,457 --> 00:51:25,999
So you're police after all?

651
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:30,837
You know what you doing
but you ain't been doing it.

652
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:34,340
- How long you been in the Pawnshop Unit?
- 13 years and four months.

653
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,259
- 13 years?
- And four months.

654
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:38,470
I gotta ask you...

655
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:41,765
What does a police officer
assigned to the Pawnshop Unit do?

656
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:45,894
You intake reports from registered
pawnshops on all items valued over $50.

657
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,188
Then you make an index card
for that item.

658
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:50,315
Then you file that index card.

659
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:54,277
If someone wants to check if something
stolen was pawned we see if we have a card.

660
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,571
If we do, we do,
if we don't, we don't.

661
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,823
- You did that for 13 years?
- And four months.

662
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:01,284
- Why'd you ask out of Homicide?
- No ask about it.

663
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,786
You got the boot?

664
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:06,080
- What'd you do to piss them off?
- Police work.

665
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,250
I think I need to
buy you a drink.

666
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:12,378
Just one?

667
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,050
Caught this case in a Brooklyn home
in the summer of '87.

668
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,345
An 80-year-old woman, stabbed up,

669
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,931
nightgown, in bed,
forced window, rear entry.

670
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,811
Worked it a couple of weeks.
Got the names of two squirrels in Curtis Bay.

671
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:32,315
Squirrel number one gives it up and tries
to put all the weight on squirrel number two.

672
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,275
Back up the statements?

673
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:38,196
Print on the rear window for number two.
One for number one on the medicine chest.

674
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:40,198
So, it's down, yeah?

675
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:45,912
Even better when number one drives by
the house where they fenced the lady's shit.

676
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,206
Clock-radio, TV, toaster oven.

677
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:53,253
- So, what's the problem?
- The problem was the fence.

678
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:56,923
Turned out he was the son of one
of the editors at the News America.

679
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:01,344
This man is running the newspaper
and his son is getting all fucked up,

680
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:04,264
getting high down
on Locust Point.

681
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:09,018
The deputy, who I guess is in a favor-doin'
mood, sends word down to the major.

682
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:12,397
I'm supposed to make
the case without the fence.

683
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:16,234
Just the print hits
and the statement.

684
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:19,404
He's doin' this to have
some newspaper guy in his pocket?

685
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:21,489
Yeah, I guess so.

686
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:24,909
Is this Burrell?

687
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:28,288
No, no, Mueller.
Deputy Ops before Burrell.

688
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,165
So, what did you do?

689
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,043
What do you think I did?

690
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:37,255
I charged him with receiving,
then had his ass testify.

691
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:40,800
You could've made the case
just on the prints and the statements.

692
00:53:41,594 --> 00:53:43,720
Probably. Yep.

693
00:53:45,598 --> 00:53:47,265
Why didn't you?

694
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,808
Why?

695
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:54,480
Why are you fuckin' up yourself
chasing Avon Barksdale?

696
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:01,070
A week after trial ends,
Major comes to me,

697
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,156
asks me where I want to go.

698
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:07,076
I tell him I don't care.
I like to be outside, you know?

699
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:12,498
Give me a foot-post, I'll still make my money.
Send my ass up to Edmondson Avenue.

700
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,250
You went to a foot-post?

701
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:17,420
Major come back,
asks me where I don't want to go.

702
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:21,007
And he asks it like
he wanna make sure I land OK.

703
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,510
So, I tell him
I don't want no fuckin' paper-shuffle.

704
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:26,346
No office shit.

705
00:54:26,722 --> 00:54:29,182
Send my black ass outside
and let me police.

706
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,476
Pawnshop Unit.

707
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,561
They got me good.

708
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:37,690
So, why'd they let you
out of the box? Why now?

709
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,320
I guess they just forgot
about me.

710
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:45,031
Shit, Lester.

711
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:48,368
You back from the dead.

712
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:51,000
You rolled away the stone.

713
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:55,083
Bunk Moreland says you're natural police.
One of the few.

714
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,336
Yeah, I've had my moments.

715
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:03,341
Detective...

716
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:07,303
When they ask you
where you wanna go,

717
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:10,390
and they are gonna ask you
where you wanna go,

718
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,476
do yourself a favor.

719
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,062
Keep your mouth shut.

720
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:21,275
I gotta take a tinkle, boy.

721
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,570
- I got it.
- All right.

722
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:40,086
Hello.

724
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:46,009
- Is Kima there?
- And you are?

725
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:48,761
Tell her it's...
it's McNulty.

726
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:03,192
For you, Kima.
A decidedly confused white boy.

727
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,278
Oh, God.

728
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:19,876
How'd it go today?

729
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:26,215
Lost him in the 221.
Picked him back up in the low-rises.

730
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:30,470
- Then lost him on Schroeder Street after dark.
- Nicely done.

731
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:36,350
- Are you OK to drive?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

732
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:38,770
I just wanted to thank you.

733
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,022
For what?

734
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,733
For today, you know, with Daniels.

735
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:47,403
- You should be thanking Lester.
- I did.

736
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:50,656
I just wanted to thank you too,
Detective Greggs.

737
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:56,079
No problem. Good night.

738
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:58,122
That it is.

739
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:10,802
What'd I miss?

740
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:13,137
Nothin' much.

741
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:16,224
- Lovelorn?
- Worse. Lonely.

742
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:23,064
You didn't make it into
class again today.

743
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:27,693
- You said you'd stick with it.
- I'm tryin'.

744
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,531
But things are hard right now.

745
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:34,117
I'm doing the best I can.

746
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:38,412
You said yourself
you need to do somethin' else.

747
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:40,206
Somethin' better for us.

748
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,626
- You promised.
- Look...

749
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,464
Oh, man.

750
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:54,137
What am I gonna do
with you, huh?

751
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:59,725
You know better women than you
have fallen for my tricks, right?

752
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:19,704
What you got under this?
