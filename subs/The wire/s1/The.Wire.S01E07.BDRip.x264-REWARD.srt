1
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,844
Low man scrapped, yo.
He all the way down.

2
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,807
But we going to start fresh on the latest
tomorrow, down from up North.

3
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,977
- No problem.
- No problem?

4
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:24,691
Yo's talkin' about some guy named Lohman,
who's down with strep, like he's sick.

5
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,360
And the last part?

6
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:31,698
Something about how he's gonna start up
a Fashion Lady or some shit.

7
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:32,782
Fashion Lady?

8
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,119
I'm fluent in the Perkins Homes
and Latrobe Tower dialects,

9
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,246
but I haven't mastered
Franklin Terrace.

10
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:43,126
They're sold out in the low-rises, so tomorrow
they start fresh with a new package.

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,461
- That's what you hear?
- Listen again.

12
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:50,216
- Low man scrapped, yo.
- Low man, meaning the low-rise pit.

13
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:55,722
- He all the way down.
- Is down to scraps on the last package.

14
00:00:56,932 --> 00:01:00,268
But we going to start fresh
on the latest tomorrow down from up North.

15
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,645
Tomorrow, he'll start
fresh on the latest package.

16
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,439
How y'all hear it so good?

17
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:09,068
Gold Coast slave ship bound for cotton
fields sold in a market down in New Orleans.

18
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:10,278
What the fuck is that?

19
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:13,239
Rolling Stones.
First two lines to Brown Sugar.

20
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:17,243
I bet you've heard that song 500 times,
but you never knew, right?

21
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:21,372
I used to put my head to the stereo speaker
and play that record over and over.

22
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:23,499
That explains a lot, actually.

23
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,673
- So, wait on black, yo?
- What's white on black?

24
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:34,177
Wait on black, right?
Even I heard that shit.

25
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:38,473
Black's code for Stinkum.
We picked that up once we got on his pager.

26
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:42,268
There's gonna be a re-up of four
G-packs in the low-rise court.

27
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,646
Stinkum is on the re-up
and it's gonna go down around noon.

28
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,690
Are you sure about all that?

29
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,249
Turn it upside down.

30
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,088
Four hash marks in a row,
one for each G-pack.

31
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,633
LO for low-rises.

32
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:17,053
- 12 for the time.
- S for Stinkum.

33
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,434
- How long to figure that out?
- Four or five hours.

34
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:26,896
You sit here looking at beeper messages
for five hours at a time?

35
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,233
I don't know, it's kinda fun
figuring shit out.

36
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,578
<i>If you walk through the garden</i>

37
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,623
<i>You better watch your back</i>

38
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,627
<i>Well, I beg your pardon</i>

39
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,256
<i>Walk the straight
and narrow track</i>

40
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,509
<i>If you walk with Jesus</i>

41
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:01,472
<i>He'll save your soul</i>

42
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,559
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

43
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,396
<i>Down in the hole</i>

44
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,233
<i>All the angels sing</i>

45
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,903
<i>About Jesus' mighty sword</i>

46
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,532
<i>And they shield you
with their wings</i>

47
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,870
<i>Keep you close to the Lord</i>

48
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,290
<i>Don't pay heed to temptation</i>

49
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,794
<i>For his hands are so cold</i>

50
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,839
<i>You gotta keep the devil</i>

51
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,510
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

52
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,937
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

53
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,649
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

54
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:58,446
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

55
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,407
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

56
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:13,294
You're not helping me out here, Sanny.
I ask you for one fucking thing...

57
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,005
- I know, but...
- All these months, I'm carrying you.

58
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,383
I'm sitting here,
watching case after case stack up.

59
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:23,346
These are all yours,
and they're all open.

60
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,308
Last year, your clearance rate was 40%.
This year, it's less than that.

61
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,270
I caught some tough ones.
There's not a lot of dunkers in there.

62
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:35,107
Mike, you're good on the dunkers.
I'll give you that.

63
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:38,694
Shit, comes to dunkers, you solve
probably six, seven out of ten.

64
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:42,239
- But a stone fucking whodunnit?
- That's not a fair assessment.

65
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:45,534
Fair?
What the fuck is fair?

66
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,955
I got a detective out there, unsupervised,
running his own special ops unit,

67
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,998
burning me
every chance he gets.

68
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,209
It's not my job to fuck
another cop.

69
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,879
Not your job?

70
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:03,219
Tell you what, I'm gonna be so fucking fair,
I'm gonna give you the choice.

71
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:08,557
Either bring me something on McNulty,
or go out there and do your job.

72
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,978
- Pick a file, any file.
- Major, come on...

73
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:16,232
Pick a murder and solve it, or bring me
McNulty. There's no third choice.

74
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,411
Stinkum will have a runner
who'll be holding the package.

75
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,914
- When you get 'em, ride the bumper.
- So he knows we're there?

76
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:36,002
Right. Lay on a blue light if you need it.
The runner's gonna bolt.

77
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,379
- I got the runner, you stay with Stinkum.
- No.

78
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:42,133
- I got the runner, he takes Stink?
- No. You both take the runner.

79
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,635
- And Stink gets away?
- Nobody gets away.

80
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,681
If we pull in Stink on a car stop now,
we got to give up PC,

81
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,725
which means
we got to give up the wire.

82
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,020
We didn't set all this up
for two days' worth of coke.

83
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,605
Snatch the runner,
stick a hook in him and go back to fishing.

84
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,608
Between the wiretap
and the runner bolting,

85
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,653
we got a charge on Stinkum
any time we want it.

86
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,618
We're also edging back into old murders,
pulling up fresh witnesses.

87
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:13,289
And there are assets to be seized,
stuff that fronts for the drug money.

88
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,291
- Like what?
- A strip club,

89
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,296
a couple of Westside laundromats, a triple-A
rated towing company, a funeral parlor.

90
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:24,258
- A funeral parlor?
- He bought out one in Gwynn Falls.

91
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,634
The money's going everywhere.

92
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,971
That's just from one girl
bragging to a friend.

93
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,849
Christ knows what else he's got
we're not onto.

94
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:35,394
Barksdale's name is on nothing.
He's always a step or two removed.

95
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,897
It's a career case, Your Honor.

96
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:43,944
Look here, Jimmy,
you misspelled culpable

97
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:47,823
and you're confusing
then and than.

98
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:52,536
T-H-E-N is an adverb used
to divide and measure time.

99
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:59,543
So... Detective McNulty makes a mess
and then he has to clean it up.

100
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,088
Great that you're going
through every word...

101
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:06,801
Not to be confused with T-H-A-N,
which is most commonly used

102
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,887
after a comparative adjective
or adverb, as in,

103
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,890
Rhonda is smarter than Jimmy.

104
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,018
Yeah?

105
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,439
There's enough indication of progress
to justify continued intercepts.

106
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:24,443
I'll sign an order
for 30 more days on all taps and clones.

107
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,530
One copy to the court,
one to the state's attorney?

108
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,535
- Anything else you need?
- What, from you?

109
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,292
I think I'll go see a man
about a dog.

110
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:46,799
It's always a pleasure,
Ms. Pearlman.

111
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,971
Your professional demeanor
and your overall competence

112
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:56,142
stands in stark contrast against
the usual municipal backdrop

113
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:59,478
of mediocrity and indifference.

114
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,022
- Sarcasm, Judge?
- No.

115
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,442
Another ten years of this nonsense,
and I see you wearing the robes

116
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,028
of the District Court
for Baltimore City.

117
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,492
That or a straitjacket.

118
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,584
Jesus.

119
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,254
I would love to throw
a fuck into her.

120
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,841
Red hair, freckles...

121
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,135
Don't you think, Jimmy?

122
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,930
As in all matters before the court,
I think whatever the judge thinks.

123
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,057
Come on, Jimmy.

124
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,853
Sit. Talk.

125
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,828
- 12-14.
- What's up?

126
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,290
Eastbound on Preston.
Stinkum and a young boy riding shotgun.

127
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,792
They're at the light right now.

128
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,266
Got 'em.

129
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,203
Let's see how he plays it.

130
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,082
Shit.

131
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,134
He's gonna bail any moment.

132
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:01,267
- Jump out!
- Bail-out on Druid Hill, 700 Block.

133
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,603
Suspect wearing grey sweats,
running into the court.

134
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,022
Fuck me.

135
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,984
- Close shop.
- Police.

136
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,783
- Step, shorty. Step.
- He ain't man enough for you.

137
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,202
- Re-up!
- Hello, Officer.

138
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,247
- Get out of there!
- Run, man!

139
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,916
- Move, motherfucker.
- White man walking!

140
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,211
Move, shorty.
That's the re-up!

141
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,256
- Goddamn.
- He's coming back!

142
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,011
- Give it up, son!
- Cut him off!

143
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,555
Yo, get him!

144
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,391
- I got the bag!
- He's going right.

145
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:47,104
- Get the bag.
- Yo, move, man!

146
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,190
What's up, what's up?

147
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,067
Damn, motherfucker.

148
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,239
Bet you don't do that shit
to a white man.

149
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:01,201
Y'all get the fuck away from him.
That man ain't done nothing to nobody.

150
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,246
Four packs. Street-ready.

151
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,000
- 12-08.
- 12-08.

152
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:13,380
Need a wagon inside the 800 block
of Lex, inside the court.

153
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,090
10-4, 12-08.

154
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,053
Anyone got a smoke?

155
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,854
How are you sitting
with your bosses?

156
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,273
Rawls tried to close this
thing down last week.

157
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,026
Blow the wiretap by charging
some weak-sister murders.

158
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,862
- What stopped him?
- Daniels.

159
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,448
- Daniels?
- I couldn't believe it either.

160
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,618
I'm ready to throw in the fucking towel,
Daniels stepped up.

161
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,952
Yeah?

162
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,038
Why didn't you come to me?

163
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,292
You don't trust me no more?

164
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,253
Who dropped a dime to that reporter,
Your Honor?

165
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:59,218
Where you been? 35 cents these days
before anybody'll cough up a dial tone.

166
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,637
No, it's 50.

167
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,516
I got another week before
my homicide shift flips to night work.

168
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,060
I'm not back with them,
Rawls sticks it to me.

169
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,021
Well...
You got a friend here.

170
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,443
Worst comes to the worst,
Pearlman goes to her bosses.

171
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,405
The state's attorney's office
still has some love for you.

172
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,865
All due respect, I'm starting to worry
more about the people

173
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,284
who claim to love me
than the ones who don't.

174
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:02,865
Now?

175
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,534
Yeah. Yeah.

176
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:10,247
Somebody's hitting Stringer's pager
from Tower Court.

177
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,207
- Now?
- Now.

178
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,391
What's up?

179
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:01,006
- Freamon.
- Visual on Stinkum.

180
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,176
- Yo, we lost four to Five-0.
- What?

181
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,554
- We lost four.
- Why the fuck are you telling me this?

182
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,097
I'll talk to you later.

183
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,625
Does he think I can just pull
it out of my ass?

184
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,091
Can't go outside and play till
your homework's done?

185
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,677
Can't do shit till I clear
this case for Rawls.

186
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:50,305
- How old is it?
- Old and cold.

187
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,641
Yours to begin with?

188
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:58,146
Then, my friend,
you are double-fucked.

189
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,861
Motherfucker.

190
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,157
Son of a bitch!

191
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,327
Give me the card.

192
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,377
- You sick, heartless bastard.
- Give me the card.

193
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,010
Jay!

194
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,512
<i>She was a gypsy woman</i>

195
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,558
<i>She was a gypsy woman</i>

196
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,530
- Madame Laurie?
- You scoff?

197
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,619
Madame fucking LaRue, Jay?

198
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:57,623
Better men than you have turned to this lady
in their dark night of dead ends.

199
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,585
You're not serious?

200
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,130
I don't joke when it comes
to Madame LaRue.

201
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:10,385
The woman has an unexplainable gift
in matters of death investigation.

202
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,221
She transcends the rational.

203
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,395
Give her a call.

204
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,996
He's dropped here, so the dumpsters
cover it from this side,

205
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:42,084
but everyone over there
with a window had a view.

206
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,638
Merit badge for two good
little Scouts.

207
00:16:56,516 --> 00:17:00,268
Ma'am, you need some help
with that?

208
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:05,524
- I'm all right.
- Please, it's our pleasure.

209
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:19,955
Let me understand. Y'all hang around
the projects, white and black together,

210
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,543
ties and jackets on, looking to help ladies
with their shopping carts and whatever else.

211
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,631
- Police, right?
- Afraid so, ma'am.

212
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:34,636
About the murder a while back, right?
Maintenance man?

213
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,150
The defendants can take a seat.

214
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,320
- The judge will be in shortly.
- Can I take the file?

215
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,490
- Here.
- Thank you.

216
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,077
Excuse me, ma'am?

217
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:15,886
Hey.

218
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,889
- Detective?
- I need to pull one out.

219
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,474
Which one?

220
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:31,193
Let's see.
Dope, coke, dope, theft, dope,

221
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,404
loitering, coke,
attempted theft, dope,

222
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,199
dope, theft, dope,
and the charge du jour is...

223
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,410
possession, to wit, cocaine.

224
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,872
- But you need him?
- I need him.

225
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,791
OK, he bounces over to drug court,

226
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,419
pleads to possession and agrees to probation
with ongoing treatment.

227
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,505
- That's it?
- That's it.

228
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,049
OK.

229
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:02,140
- I'm with your boy Bubs. You want out?
- Yeah.

230
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:06,478
Plead guilty to possession and convince
the drug court judge you want to get clean.

231
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,397
- Drug court?
- Shake it off in treatment,

232
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,733
go to meetings and pee
when they tell you to.

233
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,194
- No jail?
- No jail.

234
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,280
- I'm out right now?
- Soon as you're processed.

235
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,745
OK.

236
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:37,801
Dead man was coming this way
and another man was walking behind him.

237
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:42,347
Must've said something to him,
'cause he turned around before he got shot.

238
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,975
- Do you know the man who did it?
- No, sir.

239
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:46,977
- What'd he look like?
- Who?

240
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,480
- The bad guy.
- Light skin, medium height.

241
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,567
Didn't have no meat on him.

242
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,695
- Young or old?
- He wasn't young.

243
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:02,284
If you pretend my partner here is the victim
and I'm the guy with the gun...

244
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,247
- This close?
- No.

245
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,340
Like that?

246
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,760
Yeah, that's about right.

247
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,057
- Do you think, if you saw this guy again...
- I...

248
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,310
Please, don't be afraid.

249
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,187
From where I was sitting,
his back was to me.

250
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,986
- It's all right, you done good.
- You have any trouble at all, you call us.

251
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,542
- She can't make a positive ID.
- My man Omar can.

252
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:56,046
A stick-up artist with a half-dozen priors.
That's your witness?

253
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,341
She corroborates him on the details,
down to the close-range shot.

254
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,260
Plus we got Omar saying
if we jack Bird, we'll get the gun.

255
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,095
Says he's too stupid to throw it off.

256
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,557
So, between her and Omar,
a match on the gun gets us over.

257
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,605
It happened like you said,
like it was a plan.

258
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,398
It was a plan.

259
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,450
What's your address?

260
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,203
734 Fayette.

261
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,872
734 Fayette.

262
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,541
What's the apartment?

263
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,420
Kid, what apartment?

264
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,508
Come on, kid,
what's the apartment?

265
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:46,304
- 11-M.
- OK, 11-M. Is that so hard?

266
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:50,100
What's your DOB?
Come on, kid.

267
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,815
- What?
- It's him.

268
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,608
Who?

269
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,759
Kevin Johnson?

270
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:30,348
You hungry?
Ham and cheese? Tuna?

271
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,644
I want a Reese's, yo.
Peanut butter cup.

272
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,732
- Drink?
- Tea in a can.

273
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,610
You got it.

274
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,656
Go down to the machines.

275
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:49,242
Get a peanut butter cup
and a can of Lipton's tea.

276
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,839
Motherfucker can't even look at me.

277
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,385
- What say we start over on this?
- Start over?

278
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,888
My lawyer said I got a case
against y'all for this shit.

279
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:13,308
Fuck the lawyers.
I'm trying to talk about life here, Kevin.

280
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:20,398
The game already cost you, right?
More than it should have, I know.

281
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:21,733
Whose fault is that?

282
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,237
His. Ours.

283
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:28,531
Mine, maybe.

284
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,577
I feel like I owe you
something here.

285
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:36,498
So, I'm asking how you want to carry this.
You want to get out?

286
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:40,794
You want to do something else
with the rest of your years?

287
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,879
You come see me.

288
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,343
Tea was sold out.

289
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,349
Might be tomorrow,
or not for a while.

290
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,602
But when you're ready for
something different, give me a call.

291
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,686
I'll remember.

292
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:04,359
Motherfucker thinking he can
pimp me over a candy bar.

293
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,912
It might be a drug thing,
or maybe straight-up robbery.

294
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,960
- You're Irish, no?
- Italian.

295
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:25,296
- Santangelo?
- Santangelo.

296
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,923
Saint Angelo.

297
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,385
Early martyr,
patron saint of Licata, Italy.

298
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,346
Prayed for his killer
with the knife still in him.

299
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,182
But it's not Saint Angelo calling.

300
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,854
- It's Saint Anthony who wants to help you.
- He does?

301
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:44,607
Very much.

302
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,068
Ain't he the guy you call
when you lose something?

303
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:06,796
You sure that's Anthony?

304
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:10,175
Go to the victim's grave,
bury the statue,

305
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:14,095
wait an hour, a full hour,
no short cuts.

306
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:17,098
Then dig it up. Go straight home.

307
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,602
When you go to bed,
hold it to your ear.

308
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,438
And he tells me who did it?

309
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:37,319
I think it was my turn to pick.

310
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,955
Definitely my turn.
You had me down at the B&O the other night.

311
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,375
Night after you dragged me
to the Sugar Hill Tavern, remember?

312
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:47,587
Hey, Turk.

313
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,551
Hey.

314
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,642
Where's Nadine this fine evening?

315
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:05,230
Gainesville. Been down in Florida
at her sister's all damn week.

316
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:14,572
Shame to say though. Lack of pussy
will change even a good man's demeanor.

317
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,326
Sweet as can be.

318
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,595
- Marla.
- Good to see you.

319
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,433
- You remember my husband, Cedric?
- Yes, I do. Nice to see you.

320
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:45,770
Marla's with me on the GBC's
downtown redevelopment committee.

321
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,314
She prods me awake at the meetings.

322
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:51,651
That was drastic stuff.
Everybody was nodding off.

323
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,529
- That last one was so long...
- Excuse me.

324
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,740
Sure thing.
I was talking to someone...

325
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,745
I think it's the best
ticket in years.

326
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:13,464
500-a-plate fundraisers
for a police lieutenant?

327
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:18,720
Even in this city, that constitutes
cruel and unusual punishment.

328
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,640
Which member of the ticket
has so energized you?

329
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:25,768
The Mayor? Council President?

330
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:31,149
- The Registrar of Wills, maybe?
- The Mayor, I might recognize if I saw him.

331
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,651
For the rest,
I'd pretty much need B of I photos.

332
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:35,278
You're not wrong.

333
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:41,326
In this state, it's a thin line
between campaign posters and photo arrays.

334
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,795
Pop quiz.

335
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,843
City council? Eastside, maybe?

336
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:02,847
State senator.
Clay Davis, from the 39th District.

337
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,099
Vice-chair on the budget committee.

338
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,561
You'll never make Major at this rate.

339
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:18,237
Excuse me, while I do my duty
and kiss some senatorial haunches.

340
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:25,370
Clay, nice to see you again.

341
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,667
Come on, let's roll.

342
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,057
- Ain't you gonna sign it?
- No.

343
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,559
You get that back when
the meeting's over.

344
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,144
And if you don't stay,
we don't sign.

345
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:53,439
That's how it works.

346
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,739
Come on,
I want to see the show.

347
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:11,833
Ten. We continue to take personal inventory
and when we are wrong, promptly admit it.

348
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,919
11. We sought through
prayer and meditation

349
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,840
to improve our conscious contact with God,
as we understood him...

350
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:23,428
I ain't seen some of these faces
in so long, thought they were dead.

351
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,638
Same thing, ain't it?

352
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:29,016
Having had a spiritual awakening
as the result of these steps,

353
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,436
we try to carry this message
to other addicts

354
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,855
and practice these principles
in all our affairs.

355
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:40,194
Today's speaker is Waylon, who, if you come
to these meetings, you have to know.

356
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,287
Hell, you all know I'm Waylon,
and I'm an addict.

357
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,705
Hey, Waylon.

358
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,667
And the fact is that I want to be clean today
more than I want to be high.

359
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,669
I know that's right.

360
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,799
It's good to be here.
Hell, it's good to be anywhere clean.

361
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,469
Even Baltimore.

362
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,640
I been clean a few 24 hours now,
and I'm still dead certain

363
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,685
- that my disease wants me dead.
- Yeah.

364
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,981
I'm in here with you all, talking shit
about how strong I am, how strong I feel,

365
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:20,985
but my disease is out there in that parking lot,
doing push-ups on steroids,

366
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,822
waiting for the chance to kick my ass
up and down the street again.

367
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,534
Scars on my hands, on my feet,

368
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:31,162
two bouts of endocarditis,

369
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:36,542
Hep C and whatnot knocking down walls
and kicking out windows in my liver.

370
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,004
I lost a good wife,

371
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:44,550
bad girlfriend,
and the respect of anyone

372
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:47,762
that ever tried to loan me money
or do me a favor.

373
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,265
Pawned my pick-up, my bike,

374
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,685
my National Steel guitar,

375
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,563
and a stamp collection
that my grandad left me.

376
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,900
And when it was almost over for me,

377
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,403
and I was out there on them corners,
not a pot to piss in,

378
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:08,866
and anyone that ever knew me or loved me
cussing my name, know what I told myself?

379
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,537
I said, Waylon, you're doing good.

380
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:18,042
I surely did.
I thought I was God's own drug addict

381
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,002
and if God hadn't meant for me
to get high,

382
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:23,548
he wouldn't have made
being high so much, like, perfect.

383
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,468
I know I got one more high
left in me,

384
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:31,097
but I doubt very seriously
if I have one more recovery.

385
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:35,643
So if there's anybody out there
that sees that bottom coming up at them...

386
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,145
I'm here to talk sense.

387
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:44,694
I don't care who you are,
what you done or who you done it to.

388
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:47,655
If you're here, so am I.

389
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,865
That's right.

390
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:59,166
The Mustard Seed Group gives out key chains
for stretches of clean time.

391
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,669
So if you've earned it,
come on up and get it.

392
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,673
Does anybody have nine months?

393
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,845
Does anybody have six months?

394
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:16,267
- Does anybody have three months?
- Yeah!

395
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,151
Does anybody have one month?

396
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,787
And now for the most
important person in this room,

397
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:41,167
does anybody have 24 hours
or a sincere desire to live?

398
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,169
Yeah! All right!

399
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,197
We shoved off this morning.

400
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,324
God grant me the strength

401
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,160
to accept the things
I cannot change

402
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:20,164
and the courage to change the things I can
and the wisdom to know the difference.

403
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,799
What's the score?

404
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:33,219
Orioles, four to three.
Bernie Williams just doubled, though.

405
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:38,015
- They always let the Yankees back into it.
- They got a bullpen this year.

406
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,686
- Who's pitching?
- Buddy Groom.

407
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:46,732
- Who you driving for?
- Marla Daniels.

408
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:53,030
I'd love to crack this here crib.

409
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,199
Yeah?

410
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,618
Good day's work. Good day's work.

411
00:33:58,537 --> 00:33:59,954
What about the alarm system?

412
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,873
Shit, I'd wire that weak-ass thing
back on itself,

413
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,292
pull the truck up,
bust through those French doors.

414
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:09,422
- That'd work.
- Yes, indeed.

415
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:11,882
Sell most of this good shit
around the way,

416
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:15,302
but the art and all,
I might have to run it up New York.

417
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:18,889
Name's Damien Price,
but I mostly go by Day-Day.

418
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,975
I'm Cedric Daniels.

419
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:23,853
But I mostly go by Lieutenant.

420
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:29,400
They're bringing in Roberts.

421
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,322
There you are.
There's somebody I need you to meet.

422
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:53,632
- Go on. Take it all off.
- Rub them together like that.

423
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:59,096
See here, motherfucker.
You got to put this Gant thing on Bird

424
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:02,641
and you got to do something
with that other case, the young girl.

425
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,059
Diedre Kresson.

426
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,979
You need to charge both
them murders

427
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,273
and then you walk
that on up to Rawls.

428
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:14,612
Now, you see, Jimmy, here's the hard part,
for an asshole like yourself.

429
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:19,158
You just got to give him
them clearances like a goddamn gift.

430
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:23,704
Then you still might have to kiss his ass
for about three, four motherfucking months.

431
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,790
You're gonna have to do it.

432
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:27,875
Three or four months, huh?

433
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:34,548
Got to, Jimmy. Too fucking late
to do anything else.

434
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,343
You gonna be one ass-kissing
white man.

435
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,638
You know why I respect you
so much, Bunk?

436
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:46,185
It's not 'cause
you're good police.

437
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:50,064
- 'Cause, you know, fuck that, right?
- Fuck that, yeah.

438
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:54,693
It's not 'cause when I came to Homicide,
you taught me all kinds of cool shit about...

439
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:59,281
- I don't know, whatever.
- Whatever.

440
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,452
It's 'cause when it came time
for you to fuck me...

441
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:07,456
you were very gentle.

442
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,084
Damn right.

443
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:14,171
You could've hauled me
out of the garage

444
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:17,174
and just bent me over
the hood of a radio car.

445
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,263
But, no, you were very gentle.

446
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:27,268
I knew it was your first time.

447
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,937
I wanted to make
that shit special.

448
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,817
It was, man. It fucking was.

449
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,284
- Take your money back.
- This is mine.

450
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,369
Take it back, you old whore.

451
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,163
Turk?

452
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,749
Can I get one more?

453
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,555
- What's up?
- Hey.

454
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,809
- They up there, right?
- Yeah, they up there. Hey, D.

455
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:13,314
You get a chance,
let me pull your coat to something.

456
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:16,859
I got a little move we might could do.
So get with me after, OK?

457
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,069
All right. Most def.

458
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:24,491
The only reason why I even called Bell
was because these niggers...

459
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,994
You're not supposed to talk shit
on the phone. You know that.

460
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:36,587
What's up, bro?

461
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:38,923
Who's snitching?

462
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:44,053
- Nobody.
- Is you sure on that, man?

463
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:46,764
You done had the stick-up,
then the jump-out.

464
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:50,809
- Now they running up on Stink.
- My crew, we tight. All right?

465
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:53,604
Ain't nobody holding no extra money.
I checked.

466
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,815
Maybe your ass just ran a stop
or had a taillight out or some shit.

467
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,069
You think I'd run a stop with 40,000?
Fuck, no.

468
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:02,446
- Nigger, I don't know.
- Something is up.

469
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:07,743
So go down there today, tell them hoppers
you got working for you down there

470
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,954
that this shit is about to change.

471
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:13,082
Stringer gonna come down there,
run through the changes.

472
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:16,168
Until this shit is straight,
the Pit is dead.

473
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:30,224
Thing is,
why they didn't pop Stink?

474
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:35,187
Narcos took the boy and the package,
and they got Stink by the tags on the truck.

475
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,232
You took that down to the police
and filed a report?

476
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:42,069
Truck, I ditched that shit
up off Cold Spring Lane, man.

477
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,989
You ain't heard nothing
from the Narcos yet, right?

478
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,116
No.

479
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,201
What the fuck?

480
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:53,998
They catch four packs
popping out the truck.

481
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:56,083
They don't even get the plate?

482
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,421
What's all this shit?

483
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:04,341
Something's up, man.
Something is definitely up.

484
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,933
I got somewhere I gotta be.
Cover me with Daniels, will you?

485
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,314
Asshole.

486
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,400
Herc, Carver.

487
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:26,071
- What?
- Come here.

488
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:27,990
Come here!

489
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,626
Them two is freaks, yo.

490
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,880
Stash-finding motherfuckers
popped the package from nowhere.

491
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:43,922
Who?

492
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:47,301
Skinny black motherfucker
and that ass-ugly Narco.

493
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,720
The white boy with the ball cap.

494
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:53,390
- The ones who jumped Bodie?
- Batman and Robin, yo.

495
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:55,476
All right?

496
00:39:57,479 --> 00:40:00,022
- Bang.
- You got 'em, baby.

497
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:02,941
- I'm Batman.
- I don't think so.

498
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:05,694
- Batman's white.
- And Robin's black?

499
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,408
Bat!

500
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:14,328
You heard the hopper,
you're the ass-ugly white guy.

501
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,082
Boy Wonder,
why don't you suck my bat-dick?

502
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,084
Get the fuck outta here.

503
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:28,675
Why don't you sign this for me there,
Mr. One-day Man?

504
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:36,016
God have mercy
when they piss you, boy.

505
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,103
You mean
the god of my understanding?

506
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:45,067
We gotta get you some clean piss,
to take up into your probation office.

507
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:48,987
Yo, Bubs. Who the fuck
do we know with clean piss?

508
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,877
- So you're ready to charge this one?
- If we luck into the gun, yeah.

509
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,420
And then we tag-team Bird.

510
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,714
If we get him with the gun,
we take it federal.

511
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:11,468
Five years minimum, and he's got
prior felonies, it's a lot more.

512
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:14,555
We got an address we want to hit?

513
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,725
We're working with informants.
As soon as we get something, we jump.

514
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,062
Warm air for the afternoon,

515
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:25,023
sunny, windy and warm
with a chance of thunderstorms,

516
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:29,945
high up to 83, and then on Friday,
clearing and windy with a high near 70.

517
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,906
Weather updated around
the clock on WTOP radio.

518
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:36,118
I'm meteorologist Dave Lew
at the Weather Channel.

519
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,537
This is the WTOP radio network.

520
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,541
You worried about being seen?

521
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:47,296
If anybody got a problem
with me spending time with y'all,

522
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,341
I'd be much obliged to stick
my gun straight in their mouth.

523
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,759
How that work?

524
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,933
Bird not up in the mix today.

525
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:03,604
If we had more than a street name,
maybe we could come up with an address.

526
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:07,774
What can I say?
Out here, Bird just Bird.

527
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:12,196
- So, y'all fixing to snatch him from out here?
- That's the plan.

528
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,699
He don't pack down here, none of them do.
That's the rule.

529
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:19,077
If you want iron,
go to one of those kids up in the towers.

530
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:21,246
- We need the gun.
- Y'all got a problem.

531
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:24,124
Without knowing his crib,
we definitely got a problem.

532
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:26,293
Not unless y'all know
where Bird like to cop.

533
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,129
- Bird gets high?
- Not in the towers.

534
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:32,132
Avon ain't having his people using.
That's another rule.

535
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,760
Never get high on your own supply.

536
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:42,184
If I was hunting Mr. Bird, I would consider
the best package to be the red Dilly

537
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,061
that's over there in Carrollton.

538
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:47,231
That's if I happened to be
constabulating like y'all.

539
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:49,107
Carrollton?

540
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:53,153
I know one thing, when you all
run up on him, you all best be more.

541
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:55,989
- Careful, that is.
- Why is that?

542
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:59,326
Bird will throw down
without thinking, for sure.

543
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,543
Yo, Poot.

544
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:12,506
- Where Wallace been at, man?
- I don't know.

545
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:17,261
He in the wind, yo.

546
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,346
Wallace been fucked up.

547
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:24,309
Since they got that stick-up boy.
Put him on the car like that.

548
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:27,729
Wallace all quiet and shit.

549
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:30,357
Don't even come out
his room some days.

550
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,738
I'm looking for D.
You seen him?

551
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:45,122
Yo, D.

552
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:48,083
- Chilling, huh?
- What's up?

553
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:52,838
- What you doing down in the 'jects?
- I got something, man.

554
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,632
Something right.

555
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,886
Come on over.

556
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:05,225
- Where the shop at?
- Nothing today.

557
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:11,273
That's the thing, 'cause if you need
more of that, I got this connect.

558
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:16,153
- Yeah?
- This guy I know from the club, he from DC.

559
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:19,281
He got this thing through New Orleans,
these Jamaicans.

560
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,366
New Orleans?

561
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,244
They're offering weight, D.

562
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:30,125
- My uncle know about it?
- No, no.

563
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,252
This thing on the side for me.

564
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:34,921
I got enough to turn
a New York quarter on it,

565
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:38,592
but I don't have what you got right
here with the distribution.

566
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,345
You see what I'm saying?

567
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:47,184
I'm saying, D, I'd be taking
all the risk with them peoples.

568
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:50,520
Once I have the package,
I bring it down here and you put it out.

569
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:52,647
We do an even split
on what comes back.

570
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:55,942
Right?

571
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,363
Yeah, let me think on it.

572
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:02,282
Finally get some ends for us.
You see what I'm saying?

573
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:04,743
Yeah.

574
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,661
Most def.

575
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,874
I'm out.

576
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,126
- Be good.
- Think on that.

577
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,560
$5 hats, right here.

578
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:20,110
Which door are we watching again?

579
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:24,448
The vacant next to the store.
That's the shooting gallery.

580
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:26,116
Is he still in there?

581
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,828
Greggs is on the back and
we're on the front, so you tell me.

582
00:46:57,607 --> 00:47:02,194
$5 hats, right here. $5, baby.
I got you right here.

583
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:04,571
Cover up that head of yours.

584
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:11,745
Can't beat that, right?
$5 hats, right here.

585
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:19,461
- $5 hat there, mister.
- Fuck you, man.

586
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:26,426
Take him.

587
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:28,345
Hey, shorty.

588
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,098
Get your hands back.

589
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,184
Get your hands back!

590
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,644
Get off me, man!

591
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:38,146
- I got him.
- Get off me, man.

592
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:41,525
Get the fuck off me.

593
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,401
- I got the feet.
- Bitch-ass cops!

594
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:49,783
There you go.

595
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,202
- Fuck, man!
- Oh, yeah!

596
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,788
Look what we have here.

597
00:47:56,332 --> 00:48:00,168
- Ooh, baby, baby, baby.
- Get the fuck off me.

598
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,380
Oh, my hand!

599
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:05,924
- Fucking bitch.
- Shut the fuck up!

600
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:08,760
Shit is tight, man.

601
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:16,142
We should leave the couch
right there.

602
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:19,229
- Leave that shit right there.
- That's nice, that's straight.

603
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:27,946
So?

604
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,156
What's the deal, String?

605
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:34,369
- How often y'all changing the stash?
- Every night since we got jacked.

606
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:38,832
- Anybody on the team getting high?
- No, man. Just the old touts.

607
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,209
And they ain't handling
no money, no vials.

608
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:43,420
Y'all been going in and out
the vacants?

609
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:46,256
Making sure them Narcos
don't set up in there?

610
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,299
For sure.

611
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:50,427
I got no cell phones,
no house phones neither, right?

612
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:55,640
Nothing but these pagers
and them pay boxes over there, that's it.

613
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,273
Tear them motherfuckers out.

614
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,734
What?

615
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,570
Tear out them phones.

616
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:12,115
From now on, y'all need a pay phone,
walk a few blocks

617
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,701
and do not use the same phone
more than once a day.

618
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:16,161
You hear me?

619
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:20,040
- You hear me, right?
- Done.

620
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:23,376
- Bey, tear them motherfuckers out.
- Come on, man.

621
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:37,015
Man, come on. Get off the phone.

622
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:06,378
So, we wanted to hang
the velvet backdrop

623
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:12,050
with the Lexus and the pit bulls,
but it's still out at the dry-cleaners.

624
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:17,764
But seriously, folks,
we really wanted to show all the jurors

625
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:21,559
that you left our little interrogation
without any more scuff marks

626
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:23,937
than what you brought in.

627
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,480
Fuck you, fat man.

628
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,567
Fuck you, fat man.

629
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,653
I thought we were friends.

630
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:43,581
That gun is downstairs now
in the ballistics lab.

631
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:47,669
It comes back on a dead state's witness,
then you're gonna see death row.

632
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:52,048
- You up for that?
- Suck my dick, dyke cunt.

633
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:54,342
Where's my lawyer at?

634
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:56,720
Freak. Cunt-eater.

635
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:02,225
You got one chance,
you stupid motherfucker.

636
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,978
Roll back on the people
you killed William Gant for

637
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,981
or you gonna eat
the whole meal.

638
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:13,445
Tell you what, gimme this hand back and step
to me, and I'll fuck you in all three holes.

639
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:16,531
- Fucking charmer, this one.
- Bitch.

640
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,327
You ain't got shit on me.

641
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,997
- One of you should go in.
- Is she in trouble?

642
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,791
Kima? He keeps this up,
she'll cut his ass.

643
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:30,628
You ain't shit!
You ain't got shit on me!

644
00:51:35,176 --> 00:51:37,218
So, you're my eyeball witness?

645
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,723
So, why'd you step up on this?

646
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:47,103
Bird trifling, basically.
He killed an everyday working man and all.

647
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:49,189
Don't get it twisted,
I do some dirt too,

648
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:52,692
but I ain't never put my gun
on nobody who wasn't in the game.

649
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,445
A man must have a code.

650
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:58,573
No doubt.

651
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,124
- Man, I know you from somewhere.
- Yeah?

652
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:10,960
I was in Southwestern
before I came to Homicide.

653
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:15,215
- Worked Frederick Road.
- No, I mean, back in the day.

654
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,053
You go to Edmondson, right?

655
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,389
You was ahead of me.

656
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:26,976
You was the first brother
I ever seen play that sport with a stick.

657
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:29,103
Oh, what's it called?

658
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:31,523
- Lacrosse, man.
- For sure.

659
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,150
I was All-Metro attack.

660
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:38,696
Prep school boys used to pee themselves
when they see old Bunk coming at 'em.

661
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:45,370
Oh, so look here, homey.

662
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:50,625
Seeing as how you being all charitable
with recollections,

663
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,545
what else you got
in the way of open murders?

664
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:56,130
- Going to Barksdale?
- Going anywhere.

665
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:59,884
- How far back do you want me to go?
- As far as you need.

666
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:02,095
Murder stay murder.

667
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,397
Thanks.

668
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:22,073
Gun matches.
You're done, Bird.

669
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:25,034
Last chance to grab something
for yourself on a deal.

670
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,413
Eat my shit first,
you downtown white whore.

671
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:40,174
That's right. Take this ugly-ass
cunt-eater with you too.

672
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,898
Yo, I'm cuffed, man.

673
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:00,904
You at least give me
a fair chance, right?

674
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:03,072
Come on, man.
Don't do me like that, man.

675
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:10,747
You fat fuck!

676
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:12,790
Take these handcuffs off, man!

677
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:18,688
Fulton and Baker, you say?

678
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:21,841
It happened last year,
a couple of days after Easter.

679
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:26,554
This girl by the name of Neecee.
She about 30, 35.

680
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:30,183
Denise Redding.
Yeah, I got it.

681
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,270
I'll be damned.

682
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:39,817
Bird sure know how to bring it
out in people, don't he?

683
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,617
Hello?

684
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:54,207
The Lindsey case, right?

685
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,878
No, Lindsey.
Martin Lindsey.

686
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:07,220
Who the fuck is Denise Redding?

687
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:24,278
- What the fuck did you do to him?
- Here's yours, Mike.

688
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:37,333
I don't even fucking remember this one.
I swear I don't.

689
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:38,918
Well, it's down.

690
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:43,840
Our boy gave us a statement,
two witnesses and an ID of your shooter.

691
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,801
Take it with our compliments.

692
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:51,806
Sanny. What are you
doing downtown this time of night?

693
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,517
Madame fucking LaRue?

694
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:58,312
I gotta thank you, Jaybird,
you saved my fucking life here.

695
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:02,233
Only thing I can't figure is I asked
for help on the Lindsey case, not this one.

696
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:05,653
Hey, Mike, fuck the gypsy shit.

697
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,449
These are the guys that
saved your ass right here.

698
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:15,413
Thanks.

699
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:21,753
Hey, Jimmy.

700
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:25,798
We gotta talk, man.

701
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:29,594
It's about Rawls.

702
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:14,722
What's the plan here?
Drunken fuck on a Tuesday night?

703
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:18,684
- Is it Wednesday morning?
- I'm not drunk.

704
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:26,776
It's Rawls.
He's going after my badge.

705
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:31,948
What?

706
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:34,367
They're gonna do me, Ronnie.

707
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:40,081
I love this fucking job,
and they're gonna do me.

708
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:48,714
Come on.
