Ah, that's so funny!

32
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:18,101
No, it isn't!
You just poked me in the eye!

33
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,768
Well, you poked me first.

34
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:22,976
I can't find the thing.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,417
Here.

36
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,310
I don't know what the fuck
happened to the DeWalt.

37
00:02:28,334 --> 00:02:31,059
Everything disappears
around here.

38
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:34,417
Especially now that I'm outta
the house, she lets everything go.

39
00:02:38,584 --> 00:02:39,518
Aah!

40
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:41,310
Stop, stop, Uncle Tony!

41
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:43,059
It's freezing cold!

42
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,459
Uncle Tony, knock it off!

43
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:53,310
She wants to talk to me
about somethin'.

44
00:02:53,334 --> 00:02:55,667
Thanks for havin' us
up here, Ton'.

45
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:03,268
Jason, don't put pine cones
in the filter!

46
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:04,667
Hell's the matter with you?

47
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:06,852
<i>No, Dad, watch me!</i>

48
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:08,059
<i>He's hitting me!</i>

49
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,435
<i>Hey, what did I say?</i>

50
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:12,727
They will probably
go through their entire lives

51
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:14,435
not knowing that
their father's sperm

52
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,292
was smuggled out of jail
to get Nancy pregnant.

53
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:20,375
It was the least I could do.

54
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:23,768
I just remembered what happened
to the power drill.

55
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:25,435
Pardon me?

56
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:27,602
I loaned it
to your cousin, Brian.

57
00:03:27,626 --> 00:03:29,625
And he never gave it--

58
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:33,310
What's the matter?

59
00:03:33,334 --> 00:03:35,059
I don't know.

60
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,209
Is this one of your attacks?

61
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:41,018
No, it...

62
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:43,209
I think it's just indigestion.

63
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,667
It's goin' away.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,685
I had an attack... full blown.

65
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:56,226
- What did your therapist say?
- I don't see her no more.

66
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,101
- Why not?
- You think you're the only one

67
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,541
that has to cut back
on shit they need?

68
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:02,001
'Cause of the separation?

69
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:05,168
Now what's on your mind?

70
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:09,602
Mr. Wegler wants us
to come in and discuss

71
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:12,625
A.J.'s lousy
academic performance.

72
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:15,685
Is this the same Wegler?

73
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:18,185
From last year, the <i>riccione</i>
with the Billy Budds?

74
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,643
A.J. got him
as a college advisor.

75
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:24,226
I told this kid to start
crackin' the books.

76
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,708
Was he supposed to do that
after he got back

77
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:26,999
from the Nets game
you took him to

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,018
on a school night?

79
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:29,226
It's gotta be hard for him,

80
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,393
this situation with us.

81
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:31,583
Why don't you
cut him some slack?

82
00:04:31,584 --> 00:04:32,852
No, that's your department.

83
00:04:32,876 --> 00:04:34,810
I get to be
the prison warden over here

84
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:36,518
while you indulge him.

85
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,101
With the iPod, the drums.

86
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,643
Oh, again with the drums!

87
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:41,935
Encourage extracurricular
activity, you said.

88
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,727
Brand new drums, just like that?

89
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,518
Don't even look
in the classifieds.

90
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:48,185
Why don't you just tell me
when the school meetin' is.

91
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:49,917
'Cause I don't have to listen
to this shit anymore.

92
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:51,602
That's why we're separated!

93
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:53,476
Oh, are you kidding me, Tony?

94
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,810
That is not why!

95
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:57,268
Jase?

96
00:04:57,292 --> 00:04:59,500
Were you knocking?

97
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,518
Hi, Lorraine. I'm Billy.

98
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:05,310
The fuck?!

99
00:05:05,334 --> 00:05:07,059
Jason!

100
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,685
Ow! No!

101
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,351
Jason!

102
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,976
Jason!

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,584
Aah!

104
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,876
Oh, no!

105
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,417
You were warned, Lorraine.
The money goes up to John.

106
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,167
Fuck!

107
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:48,226
Lorraine Calluzio
and the kid, Jason.

108
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,959
Fuckin' Philly Leotardo!

109
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:54,059
She told me he warned her.

110
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,894
About givin' us
points of her take.

111
00:05:56,918 --> 00:05:58,476
Phil's a pimple.

112
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,852
It's goddamn Johnny Sack.

113
00:06:00,876 --> 00:06:02,643
It's his message
to the other captains,

114
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:03,894
that fuckin' animal.

115
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:05,143
Take it easy.

116
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:06,602
Fuck that.

117
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:08,727
Rusty?

118
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:10,500
Car's here.

119
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,226
I'm telling you, Carmine.

120
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,226
We go all out, we'll steamroll
right over John.

121
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,351
And I predict the guys on the
street in Brooklyn and Queens,

122
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,560
they'll welcome us
as fuckin' heroes.

123
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:27,935
It'll be easy.

124
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,659
It's a fuckin' declaration
of war by Johnny, if ya ask me.

125
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:35,810
- Hey!
- Ho...

126
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:37,685
There he is.

127
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:38,852
Let me kiss the ring.

128
00:06:38,876 --> 00:06:40,766
How about the one
in the center of my ass?

129
00:06:43,876 --> 00:06:45,143
- Hey!
- Feech.

130
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:47,602
- Good to see ya, baby.
- Good to see you.

131
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:49,852
Hello there, kid.
Good to see ya.

132
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,518
- Hey...
- Hey, how ya doin', Feech?

133
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:53,101
How are ya? How are ya?

134
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:56,476
Just, uh, talkin' about
that mess over in New York.

135
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,018
Sounds to me like
your friend John

136
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,560
wants to force
Little Carmine's hand.

137
00:07:00,584 --> 00:07:03,393
In my day, the top spot
would've gone to Little Carmine,

138
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:06,727
unless he was actually retarded
or crippled or somethin'.

139
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,727
He's the son.

140
00:07:07,751 --> 00:07:09,834
Come on, when was that?

141
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:13,126
Yeah?

142
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:17,894
- Vodka rocks.
- Thank you, dear.

143
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:18,810
Anybody else?

144
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:19,935
We need anything else, uh,

145
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,834
one of the kids'll come out.

146
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,685
Ton', you didn't have any lunch.

147
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:27,417
- You want a sandwich?
- No, I'm all right. Thanks.

148
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,185
Adriana, hold on a second.

149
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:34,226
Tommy Pinto's cumare, eh,

150
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,476
when I was comin' up
she had the long legs,

151
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,727
up to here, like that.

152
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:40,084
Famous beauty, smart as a whip.

153
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:43,476
My compliments.

154
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,018
Oh, that'd be beautiful.

155
00:07:45,042 --> 00:07:47,768
- Thank you, baby.
- You drove Tommy Pinto?

156
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:49,894
I was at the Clam Broth House

157
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,393
that night he beat that longshoreman
to death over a corner table.

158
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:54,393
No shit.

159
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:56,602
Here we go. Memory lane.

160
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:58,935
It's important these young guys
know the history.

161
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,560
Tell 'em about the time, uh,

162
00:08:00,584 --> 00:08:03,426
Tony and Jackie Aprile
knocked over your card game.

163
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:06,268
Oh, that he doesn't
like to talk about.

164
00:08:06,292 --> 00:08:07,393
I heard this.

165
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:09,101
This is a great fuckin' story.

166
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,226
He should be dead by now.

167
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,393
They bust in,
couple of fuckin' punks.

168
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:16,250
Guns out. Bad guys.

169
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,727
This one is fuckin' scared!

170
00:08:19,751 --> 00:08:21,351
First of all, it was my game.

171
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:25,852
Feech has forgiven,
even if he hasn't forgotten.

172
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:27,876
But it's a great yarn,
right, Feech?

173
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:32,476
Yeah.

174
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,894
Actually, it brings me
to my business.

175
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:37,250
Fellas, you wanna
give us a minute here?

176
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:49,168
Yeah.

177
00:08:50,876 --> 00:08:53,059
So, what's up?

178
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,018
I came to ask for my game back.

179
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:56,935
It's my uncle's game now, Feech.

180
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,185
Yeah, right, your uncle's.

181
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:01,768
You'll still keep
the lion's share of the rake.

182
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,268
I'm in a way just askin'
if I can run it for ya.

183
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:05,351
Why would I need that?

184
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,685
Eleven years, I ran it.

185
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:08,351
No fights, no raids.

186
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,351
Not to mention that maybe
I got it comin'?

187
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,976
Considering how
it could've gone for you

188
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,351
after you took the game down,

189
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,018
if I had been a prick about it.

190
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:17,834
Or if his old man
didn't have so many friends.

191
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:27,109
I'll give you 20%, but you
gotta rent the house from me.

192
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:30,810
I could throw some
high rollers your way.

193
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:32,310
Friends of mine.

194
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:34,351
All right.

195
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,268
Let me get outta here
before I keep talkin'

196
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:39,351
and fuck this up. Jesus.

197
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,834
Thank you, Don Antonio.

198
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:56,351
He's a <i>strunz.</i>

199
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,810
He's a busybody, that's all.

200
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:59,435
He's an egomaniac, Ton'.

201
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:00,894
Always was, always will be.

202
00:10:00,918 --> 00:10:03,894
Nothin's ever good enough--
praise, money.

203
00:10:03,918 --> 00:10:06,852
Comes in this fuckin' office,
starts orderin' people around?

204
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:09,101
He's old.

205
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,834
How do ya think that feels?

206
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,810
Can I go to the Mudvayne
concert or not?

207
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:22,518
Well, I've been trying
to think of a reason

208
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:24,499
to let you stay overnight
in New York with your friends,

209
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,268
but I'm afraid
it's not gonna happen.

210
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,226
Todd's mother already
made the arrangements.

211
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,958
And she said it'd be
better than us driving home.

212
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:32,143
She's not your mother.

213
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:34,435
Yeah, I know. Believe me.

214
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,209
Isn't life unfair?

215
00:10:37,626 --> 00:10:39,768
So, we're at
the Peppermint Lounge,

216
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:42,435
when in walks these two
stewardesses from Braniff.

217
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:45,402
Everybody's in? Aces high.
Your action, Mr. Taylor.

218
00:10:45,426 --> 00:10:46,776
- Two hundred.
- Hesh?

219
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,768
They're sitting at the bar,

220
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:49,393
we send 'em over
a bottle of Dom.

221
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:51,643
Next thing you know,
we're in the hotel room.

222
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:53,226
Me, Frankie, and the two broads.

223
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,810
I see ya, raise ya three.

224
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:56,518
- Your mother.
- But this one,

225
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:59,059
this little pothead from Texas,
she fucked me dry.

226
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,976
But she still wanted more!
She's fuckin' nuts!

227
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,727
So I'm wearin'
these pointy featherweights,

228
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:06,560
and I stick the toe in,
and I'm fuckin' her with it.

229
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:08,768
I don't know where
this story's heading,

230
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:10,166
but I guess
we should all be grateful

231
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:11,685
he wasn't wearing white bucks.

232
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:13,143
The maid walks in,

233
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:16,268
She says, "What's going on?"
And I say--

234
00:11:17,092 --> 00:11:18,976
Ante up, boys.

235
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,643
- Ho! Hey!
- Hello, girls!

236
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:24,185
- Hey.
- Hey, Ton'.

237
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:25,976
Sir Lawrence
from the Meadowlands.

238
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,768
Your Highness, how are you?

239
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:29,374
Tony, let me introduce
Bernie Brillstein.

240
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,667
Didja get my list of toys?

241
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,042
Hey, Ton'.

242
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:38,393
Oh, my cousin!

243
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:40,351
Kinda high-stakes for you, no?

244
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,602
Feech fronted my action.

245
00:11:41,626 --> 00:11:43,226
And thank you for
not humiliating me.

246
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,791
Isn't there something
in your parole about

247
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:46,935
hanging out with
degenerates like this?

248
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,685
Aww...
- Come on, he gets away with anything.

249
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,435
Last time his parole officer
made the unannounced visit,

250
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:55,001
he gave him a massage!

251
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:00,226
So how's Lady Luck
treatin' you, huh?

252
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,109
Jesus fuckin' Christ, how many
times this guy gotta say hello?

253
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:08,375
What, did I interrupt
one of your impermeable stories?

254
00:12:09,918 --> 00:12:11,250
Go ahead.

255
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,310
So, we have these girls
in the hotel room.

256
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,602
Long story short,
I got my shoe in her snatch.

257
00:12:18,626 --> 00:12:21,126
Then it falls off and she
keels over. <i>Che puzz'.</i>

258
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:31,876
Fuck it. This hand's
from thalidomide.

259
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,643
Three ladies, gentlemen.

260
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:37,268
- Ahh.
- Take it. Thank you.

261
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:38,393
The rich get richer.

262
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:39,435
So, Doc,

263
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,185
how's the plans for the wedding?

264
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:43,560
Please. It's not
a wedding planner anymore.

265
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:46,268
It's an environment
and event coordinator.

266
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:48,727
What the hell.
She's my only daughter.

267
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:50,976
She and Iris
have their hearts set

268
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,560
on making the Vows column
of the Sunday New York Times.

269
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:54,976
Featured Couple of the Week.

270
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,435
Our publicist
is lookin' for a hook.

271
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:00,518
Turns out that Gillian's law
degree from Harvard means bupkis.

272
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:01,935
Everybody's got that or better.

273
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:03,727
If it was a black couple
or a gay couple,

274
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:05,185
- they'd be in.
- Hmm.

275
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:07,393
My wife calls
the Times wedding section

276
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,852
the "ladies sport page."

277
00:13:08,876 --> 00:13:10,393
So Ira, who's the lucky guy?

278
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:12,143
Jeremy Silverman.

279
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,768
Puppeteer. Children's
Television Workshop.

280
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:16,435
Father's Asa Silverman,

281
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:18,768
head of commercial paper
at Goldman Sachs.

282
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:19,935
Upper East Side.

283
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:21,625
I didn't get my invitation.

284
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:30,392
Fuck you.

285
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:35,168
That was good.

286
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:42,226
You told me to be
sure to let you know

287
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,659
- when it was a quarter of.
- Thank you, Mary.

288
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,185
So with Wesleyan
as your fallback,

289
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:48,894
I think we're in
pretty good shape.

290
00:13:48,918 --> 00:13:50,727
Straight A's at
Middlebury's Language Camp,

291
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:52,059
can't sneeze at that.

292
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,602
And your blues folkloric studies

293
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:54,976
in Mississippi last summer

294
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,310
have an almost community service
spin to them.

295
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:59,476
I just wish he had the
minority thing going for him.

296
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,976
If we can just nudge
Lem's verbals past 760

297
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,768
on the next round, he can
basically write his own ticket.

298
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:06,143
I'm stoked.

299
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:08,126
Appreciate your help.

300
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,417
Folks?

301
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:16,268
So lemme guess.

302
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:18,852
He called the English teacher
Daddy-O.

303
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:20,368
Oh.

304
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:23,935
Thing is...

305
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:26,935
we are rapidly approaching
crisis mode here

306
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,643
with these grades.

307
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,935
And time is of the essence.

308
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,018
Could I ask a question?

309
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:35,143
I handed in
my final list of colleges.

310
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:38,059
- Did you get that?
- Yes. We talked about this.

311
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:41,518
So... Ramapo and Trenton State.

312
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:45,143
And our reach schools, University
of Arizona and Arizona State.

313
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:48,351
I'm gonna take him out there after I
drive him around to the ones in New Jersey.

314
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,518
If either of the Arizonas is
what he's got his heart set on,

315
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:53,560
he's not gonna get in
with these grades.

316
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:55,143
And I know about football,
Anthony,

317
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:57,018
That's our ace in the hole.

318
00:14:57,042 --> 00:15:01,310
- He says he's tryin' his best.
- SAT-wise, 505 and 430,

319
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:04,143
uh, I think we can
edge up the math

320
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:06,143
into the fives the next round,

321
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:08,435
providing Anthony feels
he can bear down and focus.

322
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:09,894
He's had trouble
with that before.

323
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:12,143
Remember, Carm, when
they thought he had ADD?

324
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:14,393
- You didn't tell me that.
- Anthony, what do you say

325
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:16,643
you head on back to class,
let us talk?

326
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:19,810
But if I'm learning disabled,
I get unlimited time on my SATS.

327
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:20,935
Is that true?

328
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,168
Let's talk about that later.

329
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:37,059
So, you had time to talk
directly to Dr. Rapke

330
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,727
about last week's
testing results?

331
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:44,018
Yes. She said Anthony has
good interpersonal skills,

332
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:46,476
she said his affect was--

333
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,518
where is it?--
"constricted," she called it,

334
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:51,894
but that was normal
for a teenager.

335
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:55,518
And all in all he seemed
to be handling the split well.

336
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:59,059
This is not to say I don't get a
ration of shit in every conversation.

337
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,852
Pardon my French.

338
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,268
Well, still, uh,

339
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:05,250
there's this thing
with his grades.

340
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:08,393
Do you think it would be
of benefit to him

341
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:11,643
to see a psychologist
on a regular basis?

342
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:16,476
You don't approve
of therapy, Mr. Soprano?

343
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,935
People use it as a crutch.

344
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,875
And I always wonder
what happened to Gary Cooper,

345
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:22,768
the strong, silent type.

346
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:26,068
Well, Gary Cooper wasn't
a 16-year-old boy.

347
00:16:26,692 --> 00:16:28,427
He was at one time.

348
00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:31,852
I'm gonna have to agree with my
husband here, Mr. Wegler.

349
00:16:31,876 --> 00:16:34,894
We sent our daughter to an
adolescent developmentalist,

350
00:16:34,918 --> 00:16:36,185
and it was a disaster.

351
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:37,727
I know my son. He's just lazy.

352
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:39,560
We're gonna get him
a different SAT tutor,

353
00:16:39,584 --> 00:16:41,333
and I'm gonna stay on him
and he's gonna work harder.

354
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,834
And that's that.

355
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:45,750
They said I might be
learning disabled.

356
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:48,185
Hey, didn't he tell you
to go to class?

357
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:51,435
What's going on, Mary?

358
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:54,518
Domenica Paolini
and Sasha Caputo,

359
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:57,976
they were on their way to school
this morning and they hit a tree.

360
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,042
Nick is dead. Sasha's in a coma.

361
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,001
What's that?

362
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,042
It was here when I got here.

363
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:24,226
Okay, if a million zeroes
can be written

364
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,643
on the front and back
of a sheet of paper,

365
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:28,894
how many sheets of paper
do you need

366
00:17:28,918 --> 00:17:31,168
for a googol of zeroes?

367
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:47,101
Whoa!

368
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,226
Oh man, oh baby, an Xterra SE!

369
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,101
It's loaded.
3.3 liter supercharged.

370
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,643
- What, this is mine?
- Yeah.

371
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:58,643
- You are unbelievable.
- Sticker's still on it.

372
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:00,226
He doesn't have
enough distractions?

373
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,518
After what happened
to those kids at his school?

374
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:04,602
Thing's got sensors
in the seatbelts.

375
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:07,518
It's part of Nissan's
triple safety philosophy.

376
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:09,643
- Nice ride.
- Are you leaving?

377
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:12,709
- Hour's up.
- You're not gettin' in?

378
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,560
This is so deck.

379
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:22,852
What is this, Bose?

380
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:24,143
Yeah, six-CD changer.

381
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:25,560
It's got surround sound.

382
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:27,018
I feel safer already.

383
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:28,834
Carmela, this car is a tank.

384
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,476
What's the matter?

385
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,643
SUVs eat up more of the ozone.

386
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:38,208
So you wanna be the sucker in a
regular car that gets decapitated?

387
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:40,810
I'm gonna catch some shit
at school for this.

388
00:18:40,834 --> 00:18:43,209
So what do you wanna do?

389
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,810
Screw it. Can we take it out?

390
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,101
Yeah, we can take it out. Once.

391
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,143
Then this baby sits
in the garage

392
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:52,583
till you pull your grades
up to a "C."

393
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:54,602
- What?
- You heard your father.

394
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:56,333
I was talkin' to him, not you.

395
00:18:58,584 --> 00:18:59,810
I gotta put dinner on.

396
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:01,667
Tony, I have bills for you.

397
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:09,101
You better be nice
to your mother.

398
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:12,250
She's got the keys
till your grades are up.

399
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,709
I'll be right back.

400
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,685
The car is a motivational tool.

401
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:22,560
The carrot and the stick--
you gotta do both!

402
00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:25,976
I could strangle him sometimes.
He can be so hateful.

403
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,059
The smart mouth is not good.

404
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,226
That's minor, believe me.

405
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,143
God, what happened to him?

406
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:33,810
He was always the sweet one.

407
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:35,476
He had the concept of sharing

408
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,351
before any of
the other toddlers...

409
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,583
Well, Meadow was always sharper,

410
00:19:38,584 --> 00:19:40,476
but I remember
the same thing with her.

411
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,459
It's like watchin'
an angel fall.

412
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:48,500
What are you, cryin'?

413
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:58,101
Here's the tutor, in
writing like you had to have.

414
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:02,018
I had to call RotoRooter. That's a
cheap sound system for the media room.

415
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:04,768
- Why should I pay for that?
- Because you took the last one.

416
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:07,768
Your little movie connoisseur
friends, they're still meetin'?

417
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:10,518
- At least I have friends.
- The fuck's that supposed to mean?

418
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,560
C'mon, Tony, you just have
a bunch of flunkies.

419
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:13,894
What do you know about it?

420
00:20:13,918 --> 00:20:15,894
They compliment you
on your new shoes,

421
00:20:15,918 --> 00:20:18,685
they tell you that
you're not going bald.

422
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:21,059
You think they really care?
You're the boss.

423
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,185
They're scared of you.
They have to kiss your ass.

424
00:20:23,209 --> 00:20:25,643
- Laugh at your stupid jokes.
- Well what about Artie, then?

425
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:28,518
- You're turning into a friggin' cynic.
- Yeah, whatever.

426
00:20:28,542 --> 00:20:30,541
What do I give a shit
if they're scared or whatever?

427
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:33,435
I'm runnin' a fuckin' business,
not a popularity contest.

428
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:35,560
"I've been thinking,

429
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:39,602
and I apologize
for my use of fowl language"--

430
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:41,810
"fowl" with a "w"--

431
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:43,643
"--in regards to yourself."

432
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:46,602
You said some
very hurtful things to me

433
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:48,476
in regards to myself.

434
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,560
but it is still no excuse to
use the vile word that I used,

435
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:56,351
of which I am sure you know...

436
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,976
"that I'm talking about."

437
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,560
"Cunt," right?

438
00:20:59,584 --> 00:21:00,917
Yes, Elliot.

439
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:07,185
"You don't wish us
to be social friends,

440
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:09,059
"and so that is that.

441
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,310
"I still have great 'rigard'
for you

442
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:15,143
"even though you said
some horrible things.

443
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:18,250
P.S. I'm doing fine. Anthony."

444
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:21,560
It came with a bathrobe

445
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:25,476
and a basketful of
Dr. Hauschka bath products.

446
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,101
Ablution.

447
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,810
The desire to cleanse himself
of the deed.

448
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:33,126
Notice he still
fundamentally blames me.

449
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:43,185
- Hello?
<i>- Mrs. Soprano?</i>

450
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:44,643
<i>Robert Wegler.</i>

451
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:46,268
Oh, hi! Hello, how are you?

452
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:48,435
Uh, after our meeting
the other day,

453
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:51,894
I had some ideas about some
further strategies for Anthony.

454
00:21:51,918 --> 00:21:54,059
<i>I thought maybe we could meet,</i>

455
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,101
have lunch, a cup of coffee,

456
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,685
I could share them with you.

457
00:21:57,709 --> 00:21:59,143
<i>Next week, perhaps?</i>

458
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:01,185
Really? Uh...

459
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:03,292
well, yeah, I guess
that would be okay.

460
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,375
"Happy Birthday" by the Beatles.

461
00:22:17,209 --> 00:22:19,643
You know, I heard it
the other day in the car.

462
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:22,894
There's such a good drum solo
in the middle there.

463
00:22:22,918 --> 00:22:24,810
Drum solo?

464
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:27,001
It's the basic 4/4.

465
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:33,768
You know, Ringo was not their
original drummer. That was Pete Best.

466
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:35,643
And they fired him.

467
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:40,209
He put out his own album,
"Best of the Beatles." Sad.

468
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:45,292
So is this what they call
common ground?

469
00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:49,727
Just trying to have
a civilized conversation.

470
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:51,643
Can I go to my room? I'm full.

471
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:53,768
Am I so horrible?

472
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:55,685
You are not horrible.

473
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:57,602
Get over yourself.

474
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,292
Over myself?
What is that supposed to mean?

475
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:04,333
Just go. Do me a big favor.

476
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:10,185
If you're gonna be a martyr,
obviously I'll sit here.

477
00:23:10,209 --> 00:23:12,876
No. Go.
Put your plate in the sink.

478
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:29,126
Two hundred.

479
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:31,976
Two to go.

480
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,143
See, and raise four.

481
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:36,351
- Call.
- So, Tony,

482
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,166
you're likin' the Escalade?
I can't keep 'em on the lot.

483
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:42,626
I love it. After I pulled out
that Global Positioning shit.

484
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,268
Oh, right.

485
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:47,084
Always got his eye
on the big picture.

486
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,226
Up to you.

487
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:54,059
I think you got that ace,
and I'm not payin' you for it.

488
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,393
- Aces over.
- Three treys, my man.

489
00:23:56,417 --> 00:23:58,435
Paulie wins. Cards, please.

490
00:23:58,459 --> 00:24:00,852
You fuck, you. Ahh.

491
00:24:00,876 --> 00:24:03,393
Used to be a great tax
loophole, those SUVs.

492
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:06,351
Told all my clients,
"Write it off on your business."

493
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,351
Accountant dies, goes to heaven,

494
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:09,894
same time as the Pope.

495
00:24:09,918 --> 00:24:12,226
Saint Peter says, "Come on in!"

496
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,185
Then he shows the Pope to this
shithouse, that's where he's gonna live,

497
00:24:15,209 --> 00:24:16,810
and he gives him
a crust of bread.

498
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:19,268
Then he shows the CPA
where he's gonna live.

499
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:22,226
It's a fuckin' mansion--
servants, broads.

500
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:26,226
Pope says, "He gets a mansion
and I get a hovel?!"

501
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,268
Saint Peter says,
"Your Holiness,

502
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:30,602
we got hundreds
of popes up here.

503
00:24:30,626 --> 00:24:33,250
This is the first
Jewish accountant!"

504
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:38,917
I used to be able
to write off condoms.

505
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,560
What do you get when you cross an
accountant with a giant jet airplane?

506
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:46,834
A Boring 747.

507
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:14,625
All right, all right. Bet two.

508
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,709
Algebra, huh?

509
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:24,643
Listen...

510
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:26,351
I have been doing some thinking.

511
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:30,500
I've decided to let you stay
in the city after the concert.

512
00:25:31,626 --> 00:25:32,935
How come?

513
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:34,768
On one condition, though.

514
00:25:34,792 --> 00:25:37,059
No Hudson Suites.

515
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:40,185
I talked to Mead. She said that
you can sleep over at her apartment.

516
00:25:40,209 --> 00:25:43,768
I will give you cab fare. When the
concert's over, you go straight up there.

517
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:47,476
Sunday morning I want you home
ten-thirty sharp.

518
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,417
Thanks.

519
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,375
Don't stay up too late.

520
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:03,209

Apparently there's been
an armed robbery.

539
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,876
Some automobiles were taken.

540
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:14,935
They left all the American cars!

541
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:17,185
- Oh, my God!
- I think his skull is broken.

542
00:27:17,209 --> 00:27:19,602
- Oh, my God!
- I'm a doctor. Let me in there.

543
00:27:19,626 --> 00:27:21,518
Brooke, our car is gone.

544
00:27:21,542 --> 00:27:24,518
Now who's a genius
for keeping his Regal?

545
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,792
Asa, they got the SL.

546
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:31,560
That was a fucking
SL55 convertible.

547
00:27:31,584 --> 00:27:34,393
You know how long my brother
was on the waiting list for that thing?

548
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:36,209
A motherfucking year.

549
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:40,417
<i>You want to go back to that?!</i>

550
00:27:43,584 --> 00:27:46,393
<i>Yes! I want to go back to that!</i>

551
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:47,935
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

552
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:50,310
<i>- How was Mudvayne?</i>
- They rocked.

553
00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:53,310
Look, I-- look, I don't think I'm gonna
be able to make it up there.

554
00:27:53,334 --> 00:27:56,310
What are you talking about?
You know Mom's gonna call here.

555
00:27:56,334 --> 00:27:58,143
<i>I'm a total dick
if I leave here.</i>

556
00:27:58,167 --> 00:27:59,935
Just tell Mom I'm on my way up.

557
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:01,351
She's just gonna call back.

558
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:02,686
<i>Come on.</i>

559
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,976
When do I ever
ask you for anything?

560
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,101
All right,
you better stay there.

561
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:09,209
And be home on time tomorrow.
I don't want any shit from Mom.

562
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:14,018
<i>Frida, why do you and
Diego have separate houses?</i>

563
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:15,894
<i>Because we are
two different people,</i>

564
00:28:15,918 --> 00:28:17,750
<i>but our love makes us into one.</i>

565
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,894
- Hello?
<i>- Mead, hi.</i>

566
00:28:49,918 --> 00:28:52,018
Is your brother there?
He's not answering his cell.

567
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:55,560
- I know. He's asleep.
<i>- What?</i>

568
00:28:55,584 --> 00:28:59,059
I probably shouldn't be telling
you this, but he was pretty zapped.

569
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:01,268
<i>I knew it. Is he all right?</i>

570
00:29:01,292 --> 00:29:02,852
Mom, he's fine.

571
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:04,518
Just wait until
you have children.

572
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:07,333
Not me. I'm never having kids.

573
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:11,059
So, how are things going?

574
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,476
<i>We're in the middle
of a movie, Mom.</i>

575
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,185
Oh. I'm sorry.

576
00:29:15,209 --> 00:29:16,393
Good night.

577
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:18,126
G'night.

578
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,602
Come on, light this fucker up.

579
00:29:29,626 --> 00:29:31,185
Gimme the lighter.

580
00:29:31,209 --> 00:29:33,168
It's on the table.

581
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:39,435
All right, go, go, go, go, go,

582
00:29:39,459 --> 00:29:41,018
go, go, go, go, go,

583
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:44,018
go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

584
00:29:44,042 --> 00:29:45,459
Hold it! Hold it!

585
00:29:49,792 --> 00:29:52,310
Open up, it's me.

586
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:53,959
Come on, open the fucking door!

587
00:29:56,626 --> 00:29:58,001
Where's the patient?

588
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,685
I got a new easel, new oils--

589
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:14,667
- I'm ready to go.
- <i><i>Salute</i></i>.

590
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:25,435
The wedding! What, do you got
everybody outside,

591
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:27,226
the ushers and everybody?
Bring 'em in!

592
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,435
- Fuckin' disaster.
- What?

593
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:32,018
Somebody hit us. They stole
all the fuckin' cars.

594
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:35,544
I had to sedate my own little
girl at her wedding.

595
00:30:35,568 --> 00:30:37,027
Jesus.

596
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:40,185
I mean, they had one of those,
whaddya call it, those car carrier things?

597
00:30:40,209 --> 00:30:42,768
And it was a very
well-coordinated operation.

598
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:44,560
The cops are on it, but ya know,

599
00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:46,143
how much faith
have I got in that?

600
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:48,268
You gotta help me
before they're chopped!

601
00:30:48,292 --> 00:30:50,727
I'm not really
in that business, Ira.

602
00:30:50,751 --> 00:30:53,976
Asa's brother's Benz
was taken, this special thing.

603
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,727
I'm fuckin' <i>gornisht</i>
in Asa's eyes now.

604
00:30:56,751 --> 00:30:59,143
Can't you do anything?
I mean, make some calls?

605
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:02,018
- Well, that shit's insured.
- He's obsessed with that car,

606
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:03,560
this fucking Stew guy.

607
00:31:03,584 --> 00:31:05,476
The asshole paid
a $30,000 premium

608
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,976
just to place the fuckin' order.

609
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,750
His glasses, his daybook
were in it.

610
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:29,168
A.J., it's your mother. Call me.

611
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:40,001
Ohh. It's my mother.

612
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,810
Ma'am, I told you,
I can't put you through.

613
00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:46,685
- Room 417 has a block on the line.
<i>- I am not waiting.</i>

614
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:47,894
<i>Who knows what's going on?</i>

615
00:31:47,918 --> 00:31:49,333
God help you if anything
happens in there

616
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:51,126
like those children
in Westchester.

617
00:32:01,459 --> 00:32:03,584
No! No, don't answer it!

618
00:32:05,584 --> 00:32:08,126
My face is stuck to the rug!

619
00:32:10,918 --> 00:32:12,768
They fuckin' Krazy Glued you.

620
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:15,435
Housekeeping!

621
00:32:15,459 --> 00:32:17,143
Fuck. What should we do?

622
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,643
We're asleep!

623
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:21,643
All right, help me.

624
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:23,542
Ow! Ow!

625
00:32:25,792 --> 00:32:28,209
- Ow! Dude, take it easy.
- I'm trying.

626
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,876
Aaaah. Ow.

627
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:34,059
Oh, fuck.

628
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:35,834
Oh, dude.

629
00:32:38,334 --> 00:32:40,542
Ohhh... fuck.

630
00:32:43,209 --> 00:32:45,292
Oh, fuck me.

631
00:32:56,459 --> 00:32:58,643
- Hello.
<i>- Hi, yeah, it's me.</i>

632
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:00,935
<i>A.J. stayed in the city
with his friends last night,</i>

633
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:03,435
<i>and he's not home yet, and
I can't get in touch with him.</i>

634
00:33:03,459 --> 00:33:05,476
Take it easy. Slow down.

635
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,727
He's probably
just sleepin' it off.

636
00:33:07,751 --> 00:33:09,894
No, I called Todd's mother,
and Todd came home.

637
00:33:09,918 --> 00:33:12,852
He could be dead by now.
O.D.'ed, God knows what else.

638
00:33:12,876 --> 00:33:15,226
- God, why did I let him go?
<i>- He's all right.</i>

639
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,059
I'll take care of it.

640
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:18,560
Gimme the number of the hotel.

641
00:33:18,584 --> 00:33:20,602
It's the Hudson Suites
on the West Side.

642
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:22,059
Tony, just go there, all right?

643
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,143
I am so worried
I'm not even angry anymore.

644
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:26,625
<i>Alright, alright, I'm on my way.</i>

645
00:33:28,876 --> 00:33:30,750
Anthony?

646
00:33:32,626 --> 00:33:34,018
Goddamn you!

647
00:33:34,042 --> 00:33:36,185
I have been going crazy
trying to reach you!

648
00:33:36,209 --> 00:33:37,999
- Later. I don't feel good.
- What happened to your face?

649
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,685
- Just leave me alone!
- I want to know what happened!

650
00:33:40,709 --> 00:33:43,310
You never even went to Meadow's
after you gave me your word!

651
00:33:43,334 --> 00:33:45,185
- Get off my back!
- You are a liar!

652
00:33:45,209 --> 00:33:46,935
- Fuck you.
- What did you say?

653
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:48,602
Get back here!

654
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,417
Ohh!

655
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:54,917
Fuck.

656
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:03,852
Puritan Salvage.

657
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,685
The big guy's lookin'
for a consignment

658
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:07,727
from a wedding
in Ringwood last night.

659
00:34:07,751 --> 00:34:09,185
Nothin' came in here.

660
00:34:09,209 --> 00:34:10,295
<i>This Benz</i>

661
00:34:10,319 --> 00:34:11,959
SL55, he wants it pulled.

662
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,959
I'll make some calls.

663
00:34:23,751 --> 00:34:26,625
- Where is he?
- In his room.

664
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:29,143
What happened to your leg?

665
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:32,101
He lied to me, Tony,
which means they both lied.

666
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:33,518
She's coverin' for him.

667
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:35,476
It's what sisters
are supposed to do.

668
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,333
Oh, of course, right.

669
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:40,393
He cursed at me. Oh, my God.

670
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:42,209
What did he say?

671
00:34:43,626 --> 00:34:45,310
He's asleep.

672
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:47,417
Not anymore.

673
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,059
Oh. Hey, Dad.

674
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,894
I was just takin' out the trash.

675
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,894
It's garbage day tomorrow.

676
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:56,643
What's different about you?

677
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:59,018
He has no eyebrows, Tony.

678
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:00,643
Who did this?

679
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:02,143
We were just screwin' around.

680
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:03,810
- What'd you say to your mother?
- Tony--

681
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:07,435
- What did you say?
- I said the F-word.

682
00:35:07,459 --> 00:35:09,810
You're finished. You're never
gonna drive that fuckin' car

683
00:35:09,834 --> 00:35:12,351
till you're 45 years old.
I'm sellin' it tomorrow!

684
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:14,750
She wouldn't let me talk! I was
trying to tell her what happened.

685
00:35:14,751 --> 00:35:17,351
Oh, see? It's my fault.

686
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:19,810
Alright, let's hear it.

687
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:23,185
Well, I-I was gonna go to
Meadow's, but there weren't any cabs.

688
00:35:23,209 --> 00:35:24,875
And I didn't think you'd want me
sitting in the street

689
00:35:24,876 --> 00:35:27,518
at 11:30 at night,
and we were right by the hotel.

690
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,810
- Enough of your lying.
- I am not lying.

691
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:32,894
Look at your face!

692
00:35:32,918 --> 00:35:36,268
If you got some kind of sexual
proclivity with that teacher or whatever,

693
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:39,226
now's the time to tell us. I
mean, what went on up there?

694
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,435
- Poppers and weird sex!
- What?!

695
00:35:41,459 --> 00:35:46,268
No! Look, we don't do drugs,
we're not some stupid dopers.

696
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:49,351
I had a few beers,
but it just made me sick.

697
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:51,351
How can anybody believe
what you say?

698
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:54,667
Because I told you.
You never believe me.

699
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:03,560
- You had a couple beers.
- Yeah.

700
00:36:03,584 --> 00:36:06,333
- You didn't do any drugs?
- No.

701
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:12,294
Alright, Carmela, look,
a... coupla beers.

702
00:36:12,918 --> 00:36:16,018
Should be grounded, yeah,
but it's not the end of the world.

703
00:36:16,042 --> 00:36:18,435
What?!

704
00:36:18,459 --> 00:36:20,602
Oh, you know what?

705
00:36:20,626 --> 00:36:24,143
I am sick of your bullshit,
both of you.

706
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:27,310
- He can go live with you.
- Don't get dramatic now, all right?

707
00:36:27,334 --> 00:36:29,393
- What? Great. Good!
- Shut up!

708
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:32,001
I have never been
more serious in my life.

709
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:36,709
Take out the trash. Go outside.

710
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:43,226
What are we gonna do? Really.

711
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,268
What did I just say?

712
00:36:45,292 --> 00:36:47,059
No, I mean, really. Come on.

713
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:48,768
Did you think I was joking?

714
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:51,268
Carmela, this is
normal teenage shit.

715
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,351
You remember us?

716
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:56,810
The CYO dance. We left Artie out in
the snow. He almost lost his fingers.

717
00:36:56,834 --> 00:36:58,894
And we still
laugh our asses off about it.

718
00:36:58,918 --> 00:37:00,643
No, I don't really blame A.J.

719
00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:02,351
He's doing exactly
what he's supposed to.

720
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:04,310
He's testing the limits
as much as he can.

721
00:37:04,334 --> 00:37:07,268
- I blame myself.
- What are ya talkin' about?

722
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:09,666
You don't know what it's like
to have your son hate your guts.

723
00:37:09,667 --> 00:37:11,226
He doesn't hate your guts.

724
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,685
Oh, thank God he's alive.

725
00:37:12,709 --> 00:37:14,852
It's my fault, Tony.

726
00:37:14,876 --> 00:37:18,976
My pathetic need to compete
with you clouded my judgement.

727
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,476
Or I never woulda let him stay over
in New York. I knew he wasn't ready!

728
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,310
I went against all my instincts.

729
00:37:24,334 --> 00:37:27,435
His eyebrows'll grow back!
Nothin' really happened!

730
00:37:27,459 --> 00:37:28,643
No, you know what happened,

731
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:31,393
I said fuck it.
And you know why?

732
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:33,727
To get him to love me
as much as he loves you.

733
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,935
He loves you. It's just--
You're his mother. It's different.

734
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:40,226
I can't be the villain anymore.
I mean it.

735
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,976
And I can't say fuck it.

736
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,542
Take him. Let him live with you.

737
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:48,834
<i>Homina homma homma homma...</i>

738
00:37:50,459 --> 00:37:52,118
- Ed Norton?
<i>- Ed Norton?</i>

739
00:37:53,642 --> 00:37:57,518
<i>Sorry, Mr. Kramden. No, the
correct answer is Stephen Foster.</i>

740
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:01,476
<i>But thanks so much, you've been a
wonderful contestant and a swell sport.</i>

741
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,518
<i>Goodbye, Mr. Kramden.</i>

742
00:38:05,342 --> 00:38:07,559
He's here.

743
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:13,393
Hey! Tarall's,
expiration date 2007.

744
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:14,709
Over there.

745
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:21,417
Have a seat.

746
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:25,435
Uh-oh.

747
00:38:25,459 --> 00:38:27,333
Sounds serious.

748
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:31,166
You have anything to do with that
wedding takedown in Ringwood?

749
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:33,101
Why, is that a problem?

750
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:35,351
I told you that doctor
was a friend of mine.

751
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:37,685
I deliberately used that word.

752
00:38:37,709 --> 00:38:39,185
Are you aware of how many things

753
00:38:39,209 --> 00:38:40,976
a fuckin' M.D. can do for us?

754
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,059
Sorry, Godfather.
He was in the game.

755
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:44,976
I thought he was just
another pigeon.

756
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,310
Who authorized you to do it?
And don't call me godfather

757
00:38:47,334 --> 00:38:49,542
with that fuckin' cute smirk.

758
00:38:51,918 --> 00:38:54,059
I know I was away
for a long time,

759
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:55,643
but when did that happen,

760
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,393
you gotta ask permission
to ply your trade?

761
00:38:58,417 --> 00:39:00,750
Here's your end! Be happy!

762
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:04,852
When were you gonna tell me
about it if I hadn't called you here?

763
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:07,435
I'm here now!
I'm tellin' you about it now!

764
00:39:07,459 --> 00:39:10,059
That's the second time
I'm playin' catch-up with you!

765
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:12,976
- What the fuck are you talkin' about?!
- The lawn cuttin'!

766
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,143
I have to send you a memo

767
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:16,417
every time I move my bowels,
too?!

768
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:20,541
You're so concerned
about my end, why didn't you

769
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:22,041
put one of those cars
through my shops?

770
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:26,435
What? Johnny Sack told me
about this guy in Newberg.

771
00:39:26,459 --> 00:39:28,768
- Johnny Sack?
- Yeah, Johnny Sack.

772
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:31,643
Anyway, he gave me a better deal
for shippin' 'em whole.

773
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:33,476
Are you fuckin' serious?

774
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,291
I don't like the way
I'm being talked to here!

775
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:37,560
What did I tell you
when you came to me,

776
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:39,351
said you wanted back in?

777
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:42,185
I said as long as you don't
step on anybody's toes.

778
00:39:42,209 --> 00:39:43,976
- In my day--
- And that's another thing.

779
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,875
I don't wanna hear no more
about how it was in your day.

780
00:39:45,876 --> 00:39:48,101
You just keep your antidotes
to local color,

781
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:50,852
like Dynaflows or McGuire
Sisters or shit like that.

782
00:39:50,876 --> 00:39:53,625
Otherwise, shut the fuck up!

783
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:01,894
Jesus Christ, Feech, I'm tryin'
to ease your transition here,

784
00:40:01,918 --> 00:40:04,168
and this is the thanks I get?

785
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:14,584
I'm sorry if I offended you.

786
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:19,959
You gotta remember, Tony,
I still think of you as a kid.

787
00:40:23,709 --> 00:40:25,126
I'll learn.

788
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:28,500
Yeah?

789
00:40:30,584 --> 00:40:32,126
Yeah.

790
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:52,126
That's funny!

791
00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:06,292
C'mere.

792
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,101
Ah, shit.

793
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:15,101
We all right?

794
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:20,084
Just... get the SL55 back, okay?

795
00:41:30,751 --> 00:41:33,417
Ya know, maybe I was
too hard on that guy.

796
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:37,226
Did I learn nothin'
from Richie Aprile?

797
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,750
Huh?

798
00:41:39,626 --> 00:41:40,976
Nip it in the bud.

799
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,667
Feech?

800
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,643
He's well liked, T.

801
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:49,168
That's another thing.

802
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,476
All right, well,

803
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,750
don't be so hard
on yourself, though.

804
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:21,768
- Hey! Olsen and Johnson.
- How ya doin'?

805
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:24,393
We stopped by the bakery,
they said you left already.

806
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,310
That's the Canali suit
I promised ya.

807
00:42:26,334 --> 00:42:28,643
He said you should
try on the jacket,

808
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:30,459
see how the sleeves are.

809
00:42:32,459 --> 00:42:34,059
- How's that?
- How's that?

810
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:36,018
I look better than Sinatra.

811
00:42:36,042 --> 00:42:38,268
- Very nice.
- All right.

812
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:43,185
Hey, I'm havin' my wine
and peaches... you want?

813
00:42:43,209 --> 00:42:44,935
No, thanks. We gotta get goin'.

814
00:42:44,959 --> 00:42:46,852
- I'll try some peaches.
- Good!

815
00:42:46,876 --> 00:42:48,643
Peaches are from
fuckin' New Zealand.

816
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:50,435
They're great.
I'll get you a glass.

817
00:42:50,459 --> 00:42:52,643
No, we should go, we should go.
Take care of that thing.

818
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:53,809
It can't wait?

819
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:55,602
Where the fuck ya goin'?
Come on, sit down.

820
00:42:55,626 --> 00:42:58,976
We gotta do this shit. You don't
wanna know, it's all fucked up.

821
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,059
What?

822
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:02,560
My imbecile cousin,

823
00:43:02,584 --> 00:43:04,268
he was weldin' his boat trailer,

824
00:43:04,292 --> 00:43:05,768
burns down his garage.

825
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:08,435
Now we got no place
to park the truck that we got.

826
00:43:08,459 --> 00:43:10,476
What's wrong with the street?

827
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,476
Georgia peaches. Those
are considered the best.

828
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,542
See, he don't want me
to know what's in the truck.

829
00:43:20,417 --> 00:43:23,852
Flat screen TVs,
50-inch plasma Philipses.

830
00:43:23,876 --> 00:43:26,768
Guy's comin' down from Montreal,
but he got delayed a coupla days.

831
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:30,101
- I got a garage right here.
- My cousin's mother's got a place,

832
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:32,310
- we can lock it up there.
- Park the load here.

833
00:43:32,334 --> 00:43:35,018
This way I'm around,
keep my glims on the stuff.

834
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:38,143
Yeah? How much you
gonna want for that?

835
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:40,435
- Two.
- Fuck you, Feech!

836
00:43:40,459 --> 00:43:44,084
- It's fuckin' parkin'.
- You gotta kick in a TV.

837
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,226
Thought I had a plan
for Anthony,

838
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,143
but I'm not so sure now.

839
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:56,476
I don't know if Rutgers's
summer program

840
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,385
accepts boys without eyebrows.

841
00:44:00,009 --> 00:44:01,268
So you heard about that.

842
00:44:01,292 --> 00:44:02,935
I was a wreck.

843
00:44:02,959 --> 00:44:05,499
I mean, look what happened to
those girls just drivin' to school.

844
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,393
We brought in grief counselors.

845
00:44:07,417 --> 00:44:10,310
How's Anthony coping with that?

846
00:44:10,334 --> 00:44:13,459
I have to say,
he never mentioned it.

847
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:17,834
They all handle tragedy
differently.

848
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:22,435
Actually, he just
moved in with his father.

849
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:24,059
- I don't know if he said.
- Really?

850
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:26,727
I don't know what you might
have heard about my husband.

851
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,042
Some.

852
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:31,268
I mean, he's a good father,
don't get me wrong.

853
00:44:31,292 --> 00:44:32,976
Our daughter is at Columbia.

854
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,999
My friends tell me I'm a snob
with this college business,

855
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,500
but with Anthony,
it's something else.

856
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,101
I just know that if he didn't get into a
good enough school to interest him,

857
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:46,810
and he dropped out, went to
work as a waiter or something,

858
00:44:46,834 --> 00:44:48,560
he wouldn't last a week.

859
00:44:48,584 --> 00:44:52,209
He would be drawn
right in... you know.

860
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,667
My husband doesn't
want that for him either.

861
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:00,185
You met him. My husband
can be very magnetic.

862
00:45:00,209 --> 00:45:02,168
Bigger than life.

863
00:45:03,459 --> 00:45:06,625
And I was so young.
It was very exciting.

864
00:45:09,542 --> 00:45:11,768
Anyway, he's over there.

865
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,435
I don't know,
maybe it'll be good,

866
00:45:13,459 --> 00:45:15,727
you know, learning the things
that men need to know.

867
00:45:15,751 --> 00:45:17,685
Well...

868
00:45:17,709 --> 00:45:21,226
Anyway, so what about you? How
long have you been at the school?

869
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,500
Since '86.

870
00:45:24,876 --> 00:45:29,185
I suppose that's what
caught me up too, with Astrid.

871
00:45:29,209 --> 00:45:32,417
Some notion of escaping
the quotidian.

872
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,768
So you were married.

873
00:45:34,792 --> 00:45:37,351
For about, well, five minutes.

874
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:39,209
Chicken marsala?

875
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,018
And the honey balsamic chicken.

876
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:45,310
Thank you.

877
00:45:45,334 --> 00:45:47,643
Hey, have you read
Madame Bovary?

878
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:50,435
- No.
- It's almost a perfect novel.

879
00:45:50,459 --> 00:45:54,685
Flaubert writes about bourgeois
loneliness and emptiness.

880
00:45:54,709 --> 00:45:57,560
Emma Bovary destroys herself
for some fantasy in her head.

881
00:45:57,584 --> 00:46:00,727
It's great. It's truly great.

882
00:46:00,751 --> 00:46:04,393
Somehow horrifically funny,
though tragic...

883
00:46:04,417 --> 00:46:06,250
I think you might enjoy it.

884
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,185
Well, I will stop by Borders
on my way home. Heh heh.

885
00:46:12,209 --> 00:46:13,768
Who was it by again?

886
00:46:13,792 --> 00:46:15,417
Gustave Flaubert.

887
00:46:18,459 --> 00:46:19,959
Heh heh.

888
00:46:23,459 --> 00:46:25,810
Heh.

889
00:46:28,034 --> 00:46:29,368
Yeah?

890
00:46:29,392 --> 00:46:31,518
Supervisor Curran, parole board.

891
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:33,584
Site visit.

892
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:35,810
Where's Eddie Stimich?

893
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:37,518
He's out sick.

894
00:46:37,542 --> 00:46:39,876
Just wanna take a look around.

895
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:52,976
The only thing better about here
than Russia is the food.

896
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,476
Good one.

897
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,685
Eddie examined every fuckin'
dust bunny in the place

898
00:46:57,709 --> 00:47:00,935
- just last week.
- Is that new?

899
00:47:00,959 --> 00:47:03,226
Uh...

900
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:06,209
Bequest. Friend of mine
passed away.

901
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,476
That your garage?

902
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,126
Nah. It's where I make
the weapons of mass destruction.

903
00:47:25,626 --> 00:47:26,746
Let's go out and open it up.

904
00:47:27,451 --> 00:47:29,435
You wanna see my fuckin' garage?

905
00:47:29,459 --> 00:47:31,560
You never seen
an oil stain before?

906
00:47:31,584 --> 00:47:33,584
Let's go.

907
00:47:46,425 --> 00:47:48,935
<i>Here's the wind-up...</i>

908
00:47:48,959 --> 00:47:50,976
<i>and the pitch.</i>

909
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,310
- Aw!
- Come on!

910
00:47:52,334 --> 00:47:53,810
Fuck Major League Baseball.

911
00:47:53,834 --> 00:47:56,675
Ever since the fuckin' strike.
Let's watch ballet.

912
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:02,518
Oh, somebody hot-boxed us?
I saw you close the window!

913
00:48:02,542 --> 00:48:04,727
- What's that?
- It's when you close all the windows

914
00:48:04,751 --> 00:48:05,894
and fart on purpose.

915
00:48:05,918 --> 00:48:07,476
That's a "Dutch oven."

916
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,935
In bed it's a Dutch oven.

917
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,268
Well, what's a Dutch oven?

918
00:48:10,292 --> 00:48:11,643
When you fart in bed
with a woman

919
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:13,310
and you force her head
under the covers.

920
00:48:13,334 --> 00:48:14,852
That's awesome.

921
00:48:14,876 --> 00:48:17,185
Yeah, but first you gotta
be in bed with one.

922
00:48:17,209 --> 00:48:18,560
Yeah, you'd be surprised.

923
00:48:18,584 --> 00:48:20,059
- Whoa!
- Oh!

924
00:48:20,083 --> 00:48:22,333
Yeah, I would.

925
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:26,109
Oh, my God! What-- Jesus!

926
00:48:29,417 --> 00:48:32,768
All right, that's enough. Go
upstairs, do your Spanish homework.

927
00:48:32,792 --> 00:48:34,435
Gimme fifteen minutes.

928
00:48:34,459 --> 00:48:35,709
No. Now.

929
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:39,393
<i>Charge!</i>

930
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,667
<i>Charge!</i>

931
00:48:43,626 --> 00:48:45,834
<i>Charge!</i>

932
00:48:48,417 --> 00:48:51,375
<i>And he goes down looking.
The end of the inning.</i>

933
00:49:30,709 --> 00:49:32,268
Just got the call.

934
00:49:33,292 --> 00:49:36,125
They put him on a
Corrections bus this morning.

935
00:49:42,834 --> 00:49:45,560
This was the better move
than takin' him out.

936
00:49:45,584 --> 00:49:47,018
Man was a legend.

937
00:49:47,042 --> 00:49:48,351
Christopher agrees, by the way.

938
00:49:48,375 --> 00:49:51,643
That's nice that he agrees.

939
00:49:51,667 --> 00:49:54,959
But I'm not runnin'
a fuckin' popularity contest.

940
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:30,209
Mommy! Look at me!

941
00:50:34,334 --> 00:50:36,042
Anthony!
