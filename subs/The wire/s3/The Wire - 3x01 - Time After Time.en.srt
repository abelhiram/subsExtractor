1
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,633
I dunno, man.
I mean, I'm kinda sad.

2
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:13,697
Them towers be home to me.

3
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:16,567
You gonna cry over
a housing project, now?

4
00:00:17,107 --> 00:00:20,297
Man, they shoulda blew them motherfuckers up
a long time ago, you ask me.

5
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:21,681
Man, it ain't all been bad.

6
00:00:22,195 --> 00:00:26,207
I mean, I been seen some shit happen up
in them towers it still make me smile, yo.

7
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:30,397
A few moments from now,
the Franklin Terrace towers behind me,

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,464
which sadly came to represent
some of the city's most entrenched problems,

9
00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:36,508
will be gone.

10
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:38,981
Ya'll talkin' about steel
and concrete, man.

11
00:00:39,063 --> 00:00:41,656
- Steel and fucking concrete.
- Man, I'm talkin' about people.

12
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:42,934
Memories an' shit.

13
00:00:43,802 --> 00:00:44,670
Ain't the same.

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,432
Look, they gonna tear this building down,
they gonna build some new shit.

15
00:00:48,443 --> 00:00:48,956
But people?

16
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:50,656
They don't give
a fuck about people.

17
00:00:50,696 --> 00:00:53,927
You are very soon
going to see low

18
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:57,484
and moderately priced houses
built in their place.

19
00:00:58,923 --> 00:01:00,524
My cousins used
to live in 2-2-1.

20
00:01:00,565 --> 00:01:03,228
- I used to be up in there all the time.
- Ma who you tellin'?

21
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,870
I caught my first
pussy up in there.

22
00:01:05,386 --> 00:01:06,477
The girl Chantay.

23
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,596
Man, why didn't you
say something before?

24
00:01:08,607 --> 00:01:10,777
They probably wouldn't be
tearin' this tower down now.

25
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:12,777
They gonna put a big-ass
sign in front sayin'

26
00:01:12,802 --> 00:01:15,031
"here's where Malik Carr
first got his dick wet".

27
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,080
You know what I'm sayin'.

28
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:18,924
Poot, you can be takin' pictures,
tourists takin' pictures an' shit,

29
00:01:18,932 --> 00:01:20,566
souvenirs of your dick
about this size.

30
00:01:20,574 --> 00:01:22,134
He ain't funny, yo,
he just jealous.

31
00:01:22,451 --> 00:01:25,031
What? Jealous of that?
You crazy, Chantay?

32
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:27,295
Man, the mention of that
bitch make my dick burn.

33
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,832
Yo, ain't no bad pussy, fool.

34
00:01:28,843 --> 00:01:31,635
Yeah, that's what they keep tellin'
your ass down at the clinic, man.

35
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:32,395
Keep that shit up.

36
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:35,356
You ever see this motherfucker
when he walkin' down to the clinic burnt?

37
00:01:35,378 --> 00:01:36,118
Poot be like this.

38
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:38,014
He looks like a backward
ass cowboy an' shit.

39
00:01:38,022 --> 00:01:38,896
Instead of like this.

40
00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:40,007
Only he walkin' like this.

41
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,904
Dick lookin' like
a fried chicken wing.

42
00:01:41,928 --> 00:01:43,336
Mistakes have been made.

43
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:46,811
And we will learn
from those mistakes.

44
00:01:47,397 --> 00:01:50,576
Reform is not just a watchword
with my administration, unh-huh,

45
00:01:50,752 --> 00:01:52,124
no, it's a philosophy.

46
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:54,787
Shit, no matter how many
times you get burnt, man,

47
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,426
you just keep on
doin' the same.

48
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,737
Nigger do not learn.

49
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,634
Now, what do you say, huh?

50
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,590
Are you ready
for a new Baltimore?

51
00:02:04,637 --> 00:02:06,358
Shit gonna be off
the hook, yo.

52
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,091
Man, my whole life been
around them towers, you know.

53
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:10,358
I mean I feel.

54
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,032
Shit, I feel like
I don't got no home now.

55
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:15,973
Housing just moved your mama
up off Poplar Prove, didn't they?

56
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:18,776
You ain't homeless,
nigga, you got a home.

57
00:02:19,046 --> 00:02:21,017
Shit, you just damn
near outta work is all.

58
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:22,312
What you mean?

59
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:25,057
I mean look all over the city,
even out in the county,

60
00:02:25,092 --> 00:02:28,799
you had people, coke or dope,
24/7, where was it they go?

61
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:33,568
Man, look, you live in the
projects, you ain't shit.

62
00:02:33,575 --> 00:02:35,217
But you sling product there.

63
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,862
You got the game
by the ass, man.

64
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:39,610
Shit.

65
00:02:39,903 --> 00:02:41,874
Now these downtown,
suit-wearin' ass bitches

66
00:02:41,885 --> 00:02:44,289
just snatched up the best
territory in the city from y'all.

67
00:02:44,805 --> 00:02:46,882
You wanna cry over
some shit, cry over that.

68
00:02:46,964 --> 00:02:47,949
Alright, everyone,

69
00:02:48,747 --> 00:02:49,909
count with me.

70
00:02:51,152 --> 00:02:51,833
Ten

71
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:53,510
nine

72
00:02:54,097 --> 00:02:54,882
eight

73
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:56,466
seven

74
00:02:57,064 --> 00:02:57,944
six

75
00:02:58,589 --> 00:02:59,633
five

76
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:00,748
four

77
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,921
three

78
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:03,316
two

79
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:04,607
one!

80
00:03:27,013 --> 00:03:28,573
<i>Oh shit. </i>

81
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:20,728
Time After Time

82
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:28,167
Fuck.

83
00:05:28,671 --> 00:05:30,243
I just stepped
in dogshit, man.

84
00:05:31,604 --> 00:05:32,178
You hope.

85
00:05:47,702 --> 00:05:49,031
<i>Is it Cheese,
can you see him?</i>

86
00:05:58,268 --> 00:05:59,253
<i>Yo, where he at?</i>

87
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,366
<i>Who you mean?</i>

88
00:06:00,555 --> 00:06:02,397
<i>Cheese, I'm lookin'
for Cheese, man. </i>

89
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:05,184
<i>Nigga, you ain't supposed to be
droppin' names an' shit. </i>

90
00:06:05,255 --> 00:06:06,550
<i>Ain't you got no sense?</i>

91
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,392
<i>I ain't say shit
about shit, man. </i>

92
00:06:08,404 --> 00:06:10,374
<i>I'm jus' lookin'
to get together with the man. </i>

93
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,310
<i>Need to see him
about nuthin' at all. </i>

94
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:14,128
<i>So he be
where he be, fool. </i>

95
00:06:14,632 --> 00:06:16,175
<i>Is he at the place
that we was at?</i>

96
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:18,024
<i>'Cause I'm lookin' to,
you know, saddle up</i>

97
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:20,028
<i>and then put another bat
on this motherfucker. </i>

98
00:06:20,057 --> 00:06:21,371
<i>He need to feel
with me today,</i>

99
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,641
<i>or I'ma take it to someone
who can handle them, man. </i>

100
00:06:23,664 --> 00:06:25,435
<i>- It's nothin' you let him know.
- A-ight. </i>

101
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:28,591
"Saddle up an' put another
bat on the motherfucker?"

102
00:06:29,224 --> 00:06:31,238
"Settle" up
and put another "bet".

103
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,569
But what was that last part?

104
00:06:34,874 --> 00:06:37,290
Man said, "he need
to deal with me today

105
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,554
or I'ma take it to
someone who can handle them. "

106
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:41,879
Girl, you do have an ear.

107
00:06:54,257 --> 00:06:55,747
<i>He lookin'
to get with him. </i>

108
00:06:55,817 --> 00:06:56,541
<i>A-ight. </i>

109
00:06:56,824 --> 00:06:59,310
<i>- Same thing as before?
- Same thing I tell 'em. </i>

110
00:06:59,404 --> 00:06:59,885
<i>A-ight. </i>

111
00:07:18,859 --> 00:07:19,669
What'r you seeing?

112
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,097
Call comes in
to Cheese's number two,

113
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:24,777
he whispers in the man's
ear and off they go.

114
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,807
Yeah.
Nothing to the call here.

115
00:07:27,217 --> 00:07:28,073
<i>Figured that. </i>

116
00:07:30,853 --> 00:07:31,991
These guys come correct.

117
00:07:33,692 --> 00:07:35,357
The phones only go so far,

118
00:07:35,393 --> 00:07:37,970
above that, it's all done
as a face-to-face meet.

119
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,823
Three months and we've
yet to hear his voice.

120
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,407
And Herc takes the alley
to cut that off from Calhoun.

121
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:55,234
So, me an' Truck go up the wrong
way on Stricker Street?

122
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:56,744
You gotta badge, remember?

123
00:07:57,248 --> 00:07:58,914
And we're doing
the same one block over.

124
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,955
So they can't go to ground
in that block neither.

125
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:03,528
Now the thing is when we jump
out on these little cocksuckers,

126
00:08:03,547 --> 00:08:04,884
there'll be
a designated runner.

127
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,031
Who's gonna sky up just so
we get to chase his ass.

128
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:07,598
But fuck him.

129
00:08:07,836 --> 00:08:10,360
We let him go and jack every
other motherfucker who stays.

130
00:08:11,556 --> 00:08:12,237
Let's mount up.

131
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,609
Carv.

132
00:08:24,794 --> 00:08:26,220
He's a complicated man.

133
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,747
And the only one who
understands him is his woman.

134
00:08:30,554 --> 00:08:31,187
Seek therapy.

135
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:43,896
Narcos! Back off!

136
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:52,704
See your hands.

137
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:54,786
See your hands.
Against the wall.

138
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:57,211
Hands up. Get your hands up.

139
00:08:57,293 --> 00:08:58,752
Get your hands up against the wall.

140
00:09:02,114 --> 00:09:03,264
<i>There he goes. </i>

141
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,709
Later son, step light!

142
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:11,682
Yo, was that the stash?

143
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:12,949
Fuck.

144
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:17,388
Let's go, let's go,
cut him off at Stricker!

145
00:09:29,973 --> 00:09:31,052
<i>I've got Calhoun. </i>

146
00:09:31,474 --> 00:09:32,506
<i>Where you at?</i>

147
00:09:48,318 --> 00:09:50,876
Lost him.
Rear Stricker 800 block.

148
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,342
Clear on Riggs.

149
00:09:58,253 --> 00:10:01,467
He just went across Stricker
in an alley headed for Gilmore.

150
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:11,871
Fuck.

151
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:14,996
We have rabbit in the alleys
near Gilmore and Riggs.

152
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:15,949
How bout some back up?

153
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:16,821
<i>Roger that. </i>

154
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:29,749
<i>Dozerman, what's your 20?</i>

155
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,281
<i>Hey, Doze,
where you at, man?</i>

156
00:10:31,701 --> 00:10:33,572
<i>He's across Stricker,
definitely. </i>

157
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:35,754
Everybody to Lambert's 20.

158
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,702
Who's the man who would risk
his neck for his brother man?

159
00:10:51,143 --> 00:10:52,855
<i>He went to ground
in this block, man. </i>

160
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:02,232
Hey, listen to me you little
fuckin' piece of shit!

161
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:04,883
I'ma tell you one thing,
and one thing only

162
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:07,111
about the Western boys
you are playing with!

163
00:11:07,803 --> 00:11:09,293
We do not lose!

164
00:11:10,384 --> 00:11:12,126
And we do not forget!

165
00:11:12,502 --> 00:11:13,839
And we do not give up!

166
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:15,199
Ever!

167
00:11:16,267 --> 00:11:18,167
So I'm only going
to say this one time:

168
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:21,018
If you march your ass
out here right now

169
00:11:21,135 --> 00:11:22,693
and put the bracelets on,

170
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:25,790
we will not kick
the living shit out of you!

171
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,805
But if you make us go
into them weeds for you,

172
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,268
or if you make us come back
out here tomorrow night,

173
00:11:31,327 --> 00:11:32,371
catch you on a corner.

174
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,247
I swear to fucking Christ

175
00:11:34,482 --> 00:11:35,878
we will beat you longer

176
00:11:35,925 --> 00:11:38,236
and harder than you
beat your own dick!

177
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,030
'Cause you do not
get to win, shitbird!

178
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:44,944
We do!

179
00:11:56,343 --> 00:11:57,469
With these towers down,

180
00:11:57,739 --> 00:11:59,639
we need to take
the rest of them low-rises

181
00:11:59,827 --> 00:12:01,282
an' all them Fayette
Street corners.

182
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:02,455
Take 'em?

183
00:12:03,381 --> 00:12:04,765
Take 'em how, Mr. Bodie?

184
00:12:06,021 --> 00:12:07,457
Ya say fuck it and take 'em.

185
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:08,818
Nigga, you ain't
got the floor.

186
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,338
The chair don't
recognize your ass.

187
00:12:10,636 --> 00:12:11,340
Take 'em how?

188
00:12:12,196 --> 00:12:13,275
I dunno, just...

189
00:12:14,296 --> 00:12:15,785
let them Fayette
niggers know,

190
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:17,275
you know,
we serious, right?

191
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,964
You know, get or get got.

192
00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:21,304
Yeah, yeah, like you did
on McCulloh Street last year?

193
00:12:21,326 --> 00:12:22,832
Snatch the real estate,
load up,

194
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,955
and just wait for some
shit to happen, right?

195
00:12:26,057 --> 00:12:28,626
Naw, man, we done worryin'
about territory, man.

196
00:12:28,673 --> 00:12:30,714
What corner we got,
what project?

197
00:12:31,137 --> 00:12:32,468
Game ain't about that no more.

198
00:12:32,632 --> 00:12:33,781
It's about product.

199
00:12:35,013 --> 00:12:35,564
Yeah.

200
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:38,531
And we got the best
goddamn product

201
00:12:38,532 --> 00:12:40,714
so we gonna sell no matter
where we are, right?

202
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:43,282
Product, motherfuckers.

203
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:44,854
Product.

204
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,479
Chair recognize Slim Charles.

205
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:52,936
Chair, our people got to stand
somewhere, don't it?

206
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,959
I mean, all the product
in the world don't mean nothin'

207
00:12:56,124 --> 00:12:58,017
if you constantly
getting your ass whooped

208
00:12:58,036 --> 00:12:59,772
for standin' on another
fool's corner.

209
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,323
A- ight.

210
00:13:01,496 --> 00:13:03,701
We had six of the towers
of the Terrace right,

211
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:06,706
all running 24/7,
but three of those we had

212
00:13:06,717 --> 00:13:09,157
to give to Prop Joe's people
to upgrade the package

213
00:13:09,193 --> 00:13:10,827
that we was
puttin' out there, right?

214
00:13:10,882 --> 00:13:12,675
Now how much you think
we lost in the deal?

215
00:13:15,818 --> 00:13:17,601
Alright, the answer
is we made more.

216
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:19,994
Half the real estate,
twice the product.

217
00:13:20,991 --> 00:13:23,040
And our profit went up
like eight, nine percent.

218
00:13:23,064 --> 00:13:23,979
Yo, get it straight.

219
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:27,075
Your territory ain't gonna mean
shit if your product's weak.

220
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,858
Go ahead and ask
them motherfuckers

221
00:13:28,894 --> 00:13:31,615
tryin' to sell them Ford Tempos
an' you got niggas ridin' around

222
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:34,580
in Japanese and German cars
in America all day.

223
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,765
Territory ain't shit.

224
00:13:36,974 --> 00:13:38,288
Especially when you consider

225
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,377
it's the fight
for the territory

226
00:13:40,682 --> 00:13:42,008
that be bringin' the bodies.

227
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:44,589
And the bodies that
bring the police.

228
00:13:45,128 --> 00:13:46,559
Yeah, but how
we gonna stand...

229
00:13:46,594 --> 00:13:48,894
Yo, chair ain't
recognize your ass, man.

230
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,167
- How we gonna stand on some...
- Come on, man.

231
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,367
How we gonna stand on some
corner that's not ours?

232
00:14:00,484 --> 00:14:02,197
Well, we got
the best product, right?

233
00:14:02,982 --> 00:14:05,182
So the chances are,
we gonna be able to bring in

234
00:14:05,217 --> 00:14:09,117
the competition by offering the
re-up with us from our package.

235
00:14:09,897 --> 00:14:10,695
Feel me?

236
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,389
Everybody makin' money,
sharing the real estate.

237
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,055
Slim Charles?

238
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:18,503
What if they don't
cop our re-up though?

239
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:21,753
Well, I'ma worry about
that when it happen.

240
00:14:23,383 --> 00:14:24,637
Until then, Mr. Charles,

241
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:26,577
we gonna handle this shit
like businessmen.

242
00:14:27,586 --> 00:14:29,697
Sell the shit,
make the profit and later

243
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:31,105
for that gangster bullshit.

244
00:14:32,712 --> 00:14:33,169
Yeah?

245
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:35,918
Do the chair
know we gonna look

246
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,619
like some punk-ass
bitches out there?

247
00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:40,006
Motherfucker, I will punk
your ass for sayin' such shit!

248
00:14:40,024 --> 00:14:41,061
- Yo, String.
- What?!

249
00:14:41,073 --> 00:14:42,352
Poot did have the floor, man.

250
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,412
Shut the fuck up, man!

251
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:45,665
This nigga too ignorant
to have the fuckin' floor.

252
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:53,207
Y'all niggas need to start
lookin' at the world

253
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,187
in a new fucking light.

254
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:57,143
Start thinkin' about this shit
like some grown fucking men,

255
00:14:57,518 --> 00:14:59,252
not some niggas
off the fuckin' corner.

256
00:14:59,292 --> 00:14:59,937
You heard me?

257
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:05,936
Adjourn your asses.

258
00:15:19,362 --> 00:15:20,991
Y'all look like shit.

259
00:15:20,992 --> 00:15:23,373
We been stuck in that
vacant since before dawn.

260
00:15:24,018 --> 00:15:24,969
How should we look?

261
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,947
Proud to know you, Detective.

262
00:15:34,462 --> 00:15:35,705
Nice look on you.

263
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:37,854
Dress for success.

264
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:44,059
I watched that motherfucker
Cheese take re-ups,

265
00:15:44,071 --> 00:15:45,956
move weight all day
and not once did he go

266
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,270
near a fucking telephone.

267
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:49,733
Closest it comes
is a call to a hanger-on's

268
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:51,094
cellphone 10 feet away.

269
00:15:51,481 --> 00:15:53,768
Which brings me back
to what I was just discussing

270
00:15:53,797 --> 00:15:54,677
with the Lieutenant.

271
00:15:55,111 --> 00:15:57,246
So far, we've been up
on some of these cellphones

272
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:59,369
for nearly six months,
the only drug talk we have

273
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,829
is from street-level small fry.

274
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:04,603
So, the feeling is
that maybe two weeks from now,

275
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:06,890
we don't go back to the court
for another extension.

276
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:09,330
<i>We charge what we have,
we try to roll someone up</i>

277
00:16:09,354 --> 00:16:11,277
<i>at Cheese or one of Joe's
other lieutenants. </i>

278
00:16:11,324 --> 00:16:12,054
Are you kidding?

279
00:16:12,075 --> 00:16:13,812
We don't have
a case worth making yet.

280
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:15,431
And at this rate,
we never will.

281
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:17,003
For chrissake.

282
00:16:17,073 --> 00:16:18,891
<i>As a plan on paper
it was a good one:</i>

283
00:16:19,064 --> 00:16:20,659
We came out of
the port investigation

284
00:16:20,694 --> 00:16:22,911
with good phone numbers
for some of Prop Joe's people

285
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:24,647
and the P.C. To get up
on those phones.

286
00:16:24,658 --> 00:16:26,793
I guarantee if we can push
this thing a level or two

287
00:16:26,828 --> 00:16:29,409
above the street we're gonna
start seeing Prop Joe himself.

288
00:16:29,503 --> 00:16:31,635
We start seeing Joe,
we're gonna see Stringer.

289
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:34,321
I can't ask for more time
on a wire that's going nowhere.

290
00:16:37,113 --> 00:16:39,330
Either we figure a way
to punch through the wall,

291
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,222
or we let it go.

292
00:16:41,981 --> 00:16:43,260
<i>- Baker.
- Yes, Sir. </i>

293
00:16:44,456 --> 00:16:45,547
<i>So you must be Castor. </i>

294
00:16:45,817 --> 00:16:47,740
Yes, Sir.
Officer Aaron Castor.

295
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:49,218
<i>You any kin
to Lloyd Castor?</i>

296
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,603
Yes, Sir, that's my uncle.

297
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:52,116
<i>Good police. </i>

298
00:16:56,087 --> 00:16:57,400
Do you know where you are?

299
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:00,098
You too. Where are you?

300
00:17:00,204 --> 00:17:01,048
The Western, Major?

301
00:17:01,295 --> 00:17:02,644
Right this very goddamn second

302
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:04,216
you're getting your
hindparts kicked

303
00:17:04,227 --> 00:17:05,981
and you're on the horn
screaming for help.

304
00:17:06,008 --> 00:17:08,131
And you got your backup
lookin' all over the place,

305
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:10,042
'cause you don't know
where the fuck you are.

306
00:17:10,065 --> 00:17:12,927
And that means I got
to explain to your next of kin

307
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:16,083
how you went and got
yourselves killed on my watch.

308
00:17:16,138 --> 00:17:19,656
Sir, we're at 1034 North Mount,
first floor rear.

309
00:17:19,797 --> 00:17:20,301
Good.

310
00:17:21,862 --> 00:17:22,883
Now which way's north?

311
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:24,800
Point.

312
00:17:28,518 --> 00:17:29,480
That's east.

313
00:17:32,245 --> 00:17:34,767
Now, don't you think
if you're in a foot pursuit,

314
00:17:34,802 --> 00:17:36,327
it might help
your backup to know

315
00:17:36,351 --> 00:17:37,770
what direction
you're running?

316
00:17:45,216 --> 00:17:48,137
Even numbers tell you
north and west,

317
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:50,248
odd, south and east.

318
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,287
Compasses.

319
00:17:54,244 --> 00:17:56,215
'Til you learn that much,
you carry one.

320
00:18:01,376 --> 00:18:02,479
Welcome to the Western.

321
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:05,778
<i>Gentlemen?
Scuff yourselves up a little. </i>

322
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:07,526
And learn the stare.

323
00:18:13,555 --> 00:18:14,798
Hey Carv, where you at?

324
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,781
I'm at a desk outside
the roll call room

325
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:18,564
on the first floor of
1034 North Mount.

326
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:19,831
And my feet
are facing west

327
00:18:19,842 --> 00:18:21,649
and my dick is
pointing south, southwest.

328
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,788
Bunny Colvin's been
giving that speech

329
00:18:24,796 --> 00:18:26,473
as long as you guys
been sucking air.

330
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:31,539
Where you at, shitbird?

331
00:18:32,184 --> 00:18:33,861
You're in handcuffs,
in my house,

332
00:18:33,897 --> 00:18:35,175
lookin' stupid, ain't you?

333
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:43,107
Fleeing and eluding?

334
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:45,969
Do we have
a drug charge here?

335
00:18:45,993 --> 00:18:48,491
Loitering in a designated
drug-free zone.

336
00:18:48,726 --> 00:18:50,873
Let me re-phrase.
Do we have drugs?

337
00:18:51,082 --> 00:18:53,686
He raised up when we hit his
corner and he grabbed this bag.

338
00:18:53,745 --> 00:18:55,316
We pursued
and recovered the bag.

339
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,853
But no drugs.

340
00:18:56,982 --> 00:18:58,038
An' they whipped my ass.

341
00:18:58,308 --> 00:18:59,290
The Western District way.

342
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:00,804
So, what do we learn?

343
00:19:01,226 --> 00:19:03,285
Using half my district,
canine and the copter

344
00:19:03,296 --> 00:19:06,270
to bring a 14-year-old
to bay, what did we learn?

345
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:09,149
That you can't raise up
and run from a drug corner

346
00:19:09,184 --> 00:19:12,045
in sector one without
my boot finding your ass.

347
00:19:13,345 --> 00:19:13,802
Right?

348
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:24,896
I got it, I got it, I got it.
Got it, got it, got it.

349
00:19:25,435 --> 00:19:27,547
Cast-iron. 20 at least.

350
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:29,025
It be better if it was copper.

351
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:30,268
Be better if it was copper.

352
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:31,535
It be better if it was gold.

353
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,722
But you know you got to
take life as it goes along,

354
00:19:33,734 --> 00:19:34,192
you know?

355
00:19:34,661 --> 00:19:35,740
Oh shit, oh shit.

356
00:19:41,716 --> 00:19:43,218
- What's wrong with you!?
- Sorry.

357
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:44,177
You past sorry.

358
00:19:44,989 --> 00:19:45,716
Chill, chill.

359
00:19:45,728 --> 00:19:46,889
We don't mean this, man.

360
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:48,919
You think you fucked up now.

361
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:51,042
S'up?

362
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:52,916
Look what they
did to my ride.

363
00:19:55,664 --> 00:19:56,567
Do it or don't.

364
00:19:56,637 --> 00:19:57,881
But I got someplace to be.

365
00:20:03,388 --> 00:20:04,701
Thank you for your kindness.

366
00:20:04,842 --> 00:20:06,520
<i>Y'all got to
pay something, anything!</i>

367
00:20:06,695 --> 00:20:07,904
<i>Be a principle here. </i>

368
00:20:07,927 --> 00:20:09,687
If we had a dime,
you would have a dime.

369
00:20:09,697 --> 00:20:11,444
We a little insufficient
right now, okay?

370
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,805
We on our way
to the metal man.

371
00:20:12,817 --> 00:20:15,022
We'll come back and pay for
everything I promise you.

372
00:20:22,609 --> 00:20:25,870
Hey, hey, after this junk, man,
we gotta rolpast K-Mart.

373
00:20:27,207 --> 00:20:27,852
Definitely.

374
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,063
One last question,
Commissioner.

375
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:32,987
Looking back over
the past couple months,

376
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:35,133
if I read the felony
breakdowns correctly,

377
00:20:35,145 --> 00:20:37,092
you've been seeing
an uptick in shootings

378
00:20:37,127 --> 00:20:39,638
and serious assaults in
the Eastern District especially.

379
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:42,170
Can we assume that you're
already addressing this?

380
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:44,985
Let me throw
that over to Bill.

381
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,085
As Deputy for Operations,

382
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:49,595
I'm sure he's got
a handle on our response.

383
00:20:50,654 --> 00:20:51,698
I do indeed.

384
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:54,853
In answer to your question,
Councilman,

385
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:58,069
I can assure you that we put
additional tactical teams

386
00:20:58,081 --> 00:21:01,084
on a seven-to-three shift
in every eastern sector.

387
00:21:01,307 --> 00:21:03,439
Additionally, we've put
the district flex squad

388
00:21:03,836 --> 00:21:04,974
on a seven-to-three shift

389
00:21:05,984 --> 00:21:07,341
being as those are the hours

390
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:09,441
when we're seeing a spike
in aggravated assaults.

391
00:21:10,884 --> 00:21:11,787
Thank you, Deputy.

392
00:21:12,878 --> 00:21:16,162
Anything else for
these esteemed constables?

393
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:16,777
No?

394
00:21:17,293 --> 00:21:18,267
Okay, then I guess

395
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:21,176
I'll see you all tomorrow night
for the quarterly budget review.

396
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:32,557
Erv, hey, you don't mind,

397
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,704
I'd like to get with
you about a couple things.

398
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,665
Can we get lunch?

399
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:37,858
Glad to, Mr. Chairman.

400
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:40,291
How 'bout Werner's
in half hour?

401
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,116
Half hour. Good.

402
00:21:48,005 --> 00:21:49,941
- You see Watkins in the back?
- Yeah.

403
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:52,686
Who's that skirt with him?

404
00:21:54,903 --> 00:21:56,471
<i>That's him there
in the orange?</i>

405
00:21:56,976 --> 00:21:57,891
<i>That's Drac. </i>

406
00:21:59,556 --> 00:22:00,858
Our last best hope.

407
00:22:01,925 --> 00:22:04,670
The talkingest motherfucker
I ever heard on a wiretap.

408
00:22:05,186 --> 00:22:05,831
Listen.

409
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:09,655
<i>No, no, the other thing.
The other thing, nigga. </i>

410
00:22:09,714 --> 00:22:10,969
<i>You talkin' about him. </i>

411
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:12,811
<i>No, her, I mean her. </i>

412
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:14,144
<i>Oh. </i>

413
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,866
<i>Cocaine, nigga,
you feel me now?</i>

414
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:17,962
<i>Goddamn, you ignorant. </i>

415
00:22:17,997 --> 00:22:20,097
When was the last time
you heard that on a wire?

416
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,103
Shame he doesn't report
to anyone who matters.

417
00:22:22,158 --> 00:22:25,627
Right now, Drac's reups
are with Lavell Manns,

418
00:22:26,354 --> 00:22:28,606
he's got those corners
over on Preston and Bond.

419
00:22:28,712 --> 00:22:30,525
And is pretty close
to selling us weight.

420
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:30,967
No shit.

421
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,688
Sydnor's been working toward him
for a couple of months now.

422
00:22:33,711 --> 00:22:34,661
Lavell's a soldier.

423
00:22:34,673 --> 00:22:36,292
He's not gonna
roll up on Prop Joe.

424
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,805
That's true.

425
00:22:38,204 --> 00:22:40,280
But if we take him off
with a hand-to-hand,

426
00:22:40,468 --> 00:22:42,474
they gotta promote
someone to replace him.

427
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:43,406
Why Drac?

428
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:45,647
One thing about our boy?

429
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,723
That's Prop Joe's nephew.

430
00:22:47,805 --> 00:22:49,717
On his momma's side.

431
00:23:01,871 --> 00:23:04,171
20 and two.

432
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:08,724
Y'all know you
ain't got pants?

433
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:13,510
And there's Dominic
standing in line,

434
00:23:14,717 --> 00:23:16,811
and when he finally
gets up to meet the President,

435
00:23:16,822 --> 00:23:18,054
who's looking the other way,

436
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:19,602
Dominic reaches
around behind Carter,

437
00:23:19,626 --> 00:23:20,928
grabs his belt, yanks it up...

438
00:23:20,963 --> 00:23:22,371
secret service musta shit.

439
00:23:22,687 --> 00:23:25,170
He says, "hey, Mister
President, remember me?"

440
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:27,188
And Carter,
actually remembers,

441
00:23:27,211 --> 00:23:29,076
"sure, Dominic Dipietro
from Baltimore,

442
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,461
on the campaign trail".

443
00:23:31,024 --> 00:23:32,372
And Dominic
doesn't miss a beat.

444
00:23:32,394 --> 00:23:34,447
He puts a finger in Jimmy
Carter's face and says,

445
00:23:34,469 --> 00:23:36,746
"so where's that money you
promised me three years ago

446
00:23:36,768 --> 00:23:38,255
to fix up my streets
and alleys?"

447
00:23:38,277 --> 00:23:38,827
Unbelievable.

448
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,486
That's nothing.

449
00:23:39,497 --> 00:23:41,538
After losing to Reagan,
Carter comes back here

450
00:23:41,562 --> 00:23:43,685
to speak at a Jefferson-Jackson
dinner or something,

451
00:23:43,732 --> 00:23:45,061
and Dominic's
ushered up to him.

452
00:23:45,072 --> 00:23:47,125
Carter asks about
his health and Dominic says:

453
00:23:47,207 --> 00:23:49,424
"You sonofabitch,
I'm still waiting on that money

454
00:23:49,448 --> 00:23:50,633
for my streets and alleys".

455
00:23:50,656 --> 00:23:52,298
- Come on.
- No shit.

456
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:55,356
Carter's just grinning
through those big teeth,

457
00:23:55,485 --> 00:23:57,878
some guy grabs Dominic's arm,
and off he goes.

458
00:23:57,925 --> 00:24:00,294
Guy says, "christ, Dominic,
you just called

459
00:24:00,318 --> 00:24:02,347
"the President of
the United States an S.O.B."

460
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:04,420
He shrugs he says, "fuck 'im,

461
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:05,757
I don't need him. He lost. "

462
00:24:08,408 --> 00:24:10,156
That's good. That is good.

463
00:24:12,961 --> 00:24:14,744
And that is from whence I come,

464
00:24:15,448 --> 00:24:17,501
proud son of the fighting
first district.

465
00:24:20,621 --> 00:24:21,559
But the truth is...

466
00:24:23,683 --> 00:24:26,232
I don't wanna be just another
muldoon like Dominic Dipietro,

467
00:24:26,713 --> 00:24:27,862
warming the backbench.

468
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,549
Not with the way things
are right now in the city.

469
00:24:31,475 --> 00:24:33,821
We're losing 10, 12,000
residents a year

470
00:24:34,138 --> 00:24:36,458
and when you ask 'em why
they're moving to the county,

471
00:24:36,459 --> 00:24:37,538
you know what they say?

472
00:24:37,562 --> 00:24:38,242
Schools.

473
00:24:38,606 --> 00:24:39,521
And crime.

474
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,535
Schools and crime

475
00:24:42,793 --> 00:24:45,059
and there goes our tax base
right across the line.

476
00:24:45,077 --> 00:24:46,754
And the Mayor's acting
like a 10% bump

477
00:24:46,766 --> 00:24:49,311
in the murder rate
is business as usual.

478
00:24:50,004 --> 00:24:50,672
Check, please?

479
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:52,725
And you know what?

480
00:24:53,512 --> 00:24:56,667
If you were smart, you'd come
to me when the Mayor shorts you.

481
00:24:56,714 --> 00:24:59,776
On hiring, on equipment,
on overtime, on cars.

482
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,500
You get the shit end
of the stick,

483
00:25:02,063 --> 00:25:02,884
you come to me.

484
00:25:03,564 --> 00:25:04,146
Not publicly.

485
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,152
I know you can't cross
the Mayor publicly.

486
00:25:06,175 --> 00:25:07,677
But back door, you come to me

487
00:25:07,712 --> 00:25:10,410
and I can use that subcommittee
to give you what you need.

488
00:25:11,923 --> 00:25:12,345
Thanks.

489
00:25:14,534 --> 00:25:15,473
Kind offer.

490
00:25:15,836 --> 00:25:19,355
Erv, I can help you
and we can turn this thing...

491
00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:22,804
but long ago, when I was just
starting out in the department

492
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:25,502
I had the good fortune
to be taught

493
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:28,255
a little something
about chain of command.

494
00:25:28,618 --> 00:25:29,791
And right now,

495
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,791
in my capacity as
Acting Commissioner,

496
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,289
I report to Mayor Royce.

497
00:25:42,353 --> 00:25:43,362
I got your coffee.

498
00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:45,544
Leave a tip if you want.

499
00:25:53,692 --> 00:25:55,253
<i>So, what do you need
to see me for?</i>

500
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,578
Gettin' out tomorrow, right?

501
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:56,871
Yeah.

502
00:25:57,645 --> 00:25:59,027
He probably
tryin' to reach out.

503
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:01,217
What you
gonna do first?

504
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:02,026
Huh?

505
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:04,255
Tomorrow, what you gonna do?

506
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:07,551
I dunno.

507
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,498
I know what be first.

508
00:26:09,721 --> 00:26:11,527
You don't know?
I know what be first.

509
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:15,464
Time out.

510
00:26:30,307 --> 00:26:31,222
<i>Back in. </i>

511
00:26:37,832 --> 00:26:38,630
Short-timer.

512
00:26:40,343 --> 00:26:41,985
You only got
the one day left, huh.

513
00:26:42,008 --> 00:26:43,909
You done the one,
just got to do the other.

514
00:26:43,932 --> 00:26:44,961
Like they say...

515
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:47,530
you only do two days.

516
00:26:48,175 --> 00:26:50,275
- It's the day you go in.
- The day you come out.

517
00:26:50,357 --> 00:26:52,972
I don't know, I did 14 years.

518
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:55,617
Yeah, well,

519
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:57,814
you know you did you
a little stretch there, true.

520
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,292
But you still
a soldier, right?

521
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,675
You know them towers
came down now, huh?

522
00:27:06,344 --> 00:27:07,963
The Terrace,
the Murphy homes.

523
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:09,276
All that shit is gone, man.

524
00:27:09,476 --> 00:27:12,079
A lot of things are different
now since you been up in here.

525
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,584
You'll see.

526
00:27:12,608 --> 00:27:13,347
Lotta changes.

527
00:27:14,074 --> 00:27:14,884
Yeah, no doubt.

528
00:27:15,228 --> 00:27:16,917
But I mean you know, shit,

529
00:27:16,918 --> 00:27:18,548
some things they
stay the same, man.

530
00:27:18,572 --> 00:27:20,190
I mean,
the game's the game.

531
00:27:21,117 --> 00:27:22,055
And the thing is,

532
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,331
since the towers gone,
I'm gonna need to take

533
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:26,196
my thing to some new places.
Feel me?

534
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:29,917
You know I'ma be home
soon enough, right?

535
00:27:30,879 --> 00:27:32,392
First parole hearing, I'm out.

536
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:33,366
For real.

537
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,926
Shit is fixed right.

538
00:27:35,841 --> 00:27:36,732
I come home.

539
00:27:38,381 --> 00:27:41,325
Shit, there's gonna be
a little hell to be paid.

540
00:27:41,337 --> 00:27:42,440
You know, what I mean?

541
00:27:42,991 --> 00:27:44,821
A good soldier ain't
gonna lack for work.

542
00:27:48,246 --> 00:27:49,523
Take that number, man.

543
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,154
When you out, you call.

544
00:27:53,148 --> 00:27:54,896
We'll hook you up,
man, no problem.

545
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:58,450
Like a coming-home
gift, a-ight.

546
00:28:01,052 --> 00:28:01,744
Call it.

547
00:28:08,195 --> 00:28:09,497
Joint mighta broke him.

548
00:28:12,382 --> 00:28:14,365
Boss, you talkin' about
a homey walked up

549
00:28:14,388 --> 00:28:16,335
an' shot Elijah Davis

550
00:28:16,699 --> 00:28:17,684
in broad daylight

551
00:28:18,283 --> 00:28:19,878
at Pennsie and Gold,

552
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:22,306
then picked up the phone,

553
00:28:22,423 --> 00:28:23,795
dialed 9-1-1, told the police,

554
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,603
"I just shot a nigger,
come get him".

555
00:28:27,361 --> 00:28:28,792
And do they break him?

556
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:31,019
Naw.

557
00:28:35,828 --> 00:28:38,714
Look we had the 20, you know,
we had to go buy some pants,

558
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:41,348
so if you just take
this short money,

559
00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:42,931
we get back at you
tomorrow, man.

560
00:28:42,932 --> 00:28:44,281
We get you on the comeback.

561
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,246
He want two for 16.

562
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,718
<i>Tell him to get two.
Tell him to get two. </i>

563
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,125
<i>This young motherfucker. </i>

564
00:28:54,553 --> 00:28:54,917
Naw.

565
00:28:55,468 --> 00:28:57,240
You see we
a little short now,

566
00:28:57,275 --> 00:28:59,453
but tomorrow, I be right
back here with the four.

567
00:28:59,465 --> 00:29:00,439
Joey said "no".

568
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:04,978
Fucking guy, man.

569
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:13,715
At these prices, I can't
afford more phone surveillance.

570
00:29:14,677 --> 00:29:15,404
I'm aware of that

571
00:29:16,753 --> 00:29:17,546
and right now,

572
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:20,128
the plan is to go for a
hand-to-hand on one lieutenant

573
00:29:20,151 --> 00:29:22,110
a couple rungs down
from Proposition Joe.

574
00:29:22,192 --> 00:29:23,776
And then roll
the lieutenant up?

575
00:29:26,568 --> 00:29:28,423
We don't think he'll
have much roll to him.

576
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,441
Joe's people are
pretty schooled.

577
00:29:31,544 --> 00:29:33,711
The hope is that they promote
this mid-level dealer

578
00:29:33,733 --> 00:29:34,877
who's a fool to replace him.

579
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:35,579
Name a Drac.

580
00:29:36,857 --> 00:29:37,991
We're on his cellphone,

581
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:40,326
if he gets promoted,
maybe he talks to Joe

582
00:29:40,337 --> 00:29:41,276
or Joe's top people.

583
00:29:41,733 --> 00:29:44,244
We get that far, maybe
we start to see Stringer Bell.

584
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:49,279
What makes you think they'll
promote the wrong man?

585
00:29:51,648 --> 00:29:52,927
We do it all the time.

586
00:29:58,101 --> 00:29:59,344
Look, speaking of promotions,

587
00:29:59,356 --> 00:30:01,667
I sent yours over to the hall.
As promised.

588
00:30:02,582 --> 00:30:02,933
And?

589
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:04,822
The Mayor's holding it up.

590
00:30:05,432 --> 00:30:07,403
My understanding is
he wants to know

591
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:08,869
what your wife is doing.

592
00:30:09,495 --> 00:30:10,785
- My wife?
- Yeah.

593
00:30:11,149 --> 00:30:12,744
There's a rumor
that she's going to

594
00:30:12,756 --> 00:30:14,023
take a run at
a council seat,

595
00:30:14,035 --> 00:30:16,005
maybe try to knock off
Eunetta Perkins.

596
00:30:17,178 --> 00:30:18,433
That's my wife's business.

597
00:30:18,703 --> 00:30:19,735
Yes, it is.

598
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:22,785
But the Mayor counts
Eunetta as an ally.

599
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,108
Our deal was
for a permanent unit

600
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:26,633
and the next vacancy
for major.

601
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:30,257
You got your unit and I sent
your name over to the hall.

602
00:30:30,938 --> 00:30:31,999
I kept my word.

603
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,202
But the Mayor,

604
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,641
he may want to know
who his friends are

605
00:30:37,665 --> 00:30:39,307
before he makes
a new commander.

606
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:45,309
Where'd she say
she was gonna be at?

607
00:30:46,698 --> 00:30:48,776
Near the dugout, first-base side.

608
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,155
She'll turn up.

609
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:52,157
When she supposed
to bring 'em over to you?

610
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:53,143
Middle of the fourth.

611
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,691
Dad, can I have a hotdog?

612
00:30:57,945 --> 00:30:59,914
Yeah, as soon as
the guy comes around.

613
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:03,021
Speaking of which,
where's the beer man?

614
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,064
There they are.

615
00:31:13,216 --> 00:31:15,109
Oh, damn,
they got great seats.

616
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:16,377
Ah, hell.

617
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:19,178
What?

618
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,105
The guy on her left, the suit.

619
00:31:22,932 --> 00:31:23,775
Just a friend.

620
00:31:24,376 --> 00:31:25,612
Nah, he's in the cake.

621
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:32,942
Who goes to
an Orioles game in a suit,

622
00:31:32,964 --> 00:31:34,769
spends half the time
on a his cellphone?

623
00:31:34,944 --> 00:31:35,808
Downtown lawyer.

624
00:31:37,449 --> 00:31:38,630
Someone wealthy like that.

625
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,965
<i>Wish we had more of it. </i>

626
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,802
Long way to go
for half a shot.

627
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:51,522
We'll do better
tomorrow, Bubs.

628
00:31:53,199 --> 00:31:57,071
What kinda dope fiend
be talkin' about tomorrow?

629
00:31:58,045 --> 00:31:59,117
Tomorrow ain't shit.

630
00:32:00,998 --> 00:32:01,709
Today, Johnny.

631
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:05,918
Today I hunted down
all that metal,

632
00:32:06,618 --> 00:32:07,887
lugged it around like a dog,

633
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:11,978
and nearly got kilt
over a scratch of metal

634
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,400
so that I had to
beg for my life.

635
00:32:16,098 --> 00:32:18,329
Lost my trousers, man.
My fuckin' trousers.

636
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,775
And then I'm beggin'
again for half a shot.

637
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:27,850
Swear to god, man,
I'm not even high.

638
00:32:37,161 --> 00:32:38,758
We just missed
a foul pop.

639
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:39,152
Yeah?

640
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,683
Our seats are great.

641
00:32:40,814 --> 00:32:42,184
We're practically
on the field.

642
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,260
Yeah my friend, Dennis,

643
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:46,210
he gets company seats
every now and then.

644
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,447
Where are you sitting?

645
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:50,117
Mezzanine. Come on.

646
00:32:50,183 --> 00:32:51,780
- Aw...
- No, no, you guys go.

647
00:32:51,802 --> 00:32:53,253
Your dad hasn't
seen you all week.

648
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,810
Now, don't take
their jackets off

649
00:32:54,843 --> 00:32:56,976
'cause Sean's just
getting over a cold. Okay?

650
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,991
Jimmy, right?
Dennis Kerpelman.

651
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,791
Great kids.

652
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:06,051
Anyway, nice meeting you.

653
00:33:07,968 --> 00:33:09,532
You want anything
from the stand?

654
00:33:09,576 --> 00:33:10,823
No, thank you.

655
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:21,240
Don't stay 'til the last inning
'cause it's a school night.

656
00:33:24,073 --> 00:33:24,412
Bye.

657
00:33:37,906 --> 00:33:40,050
You got spatter going in
two different directions,

658
00:33:40,071 --> 00:33:41,029
just off the curb.

659
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:45,302
Yeah.

660
00:33:45,378 --> 00:33:46,527
<i>Shooting on the West Side. <i>

661
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:47,883
Another one?

662
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,294
Christ, where?

663
00:33:49,316 --> 00:33:50,957
North and Polanski,
Cole's up.

664
00:33:51,788 --> 00:33:53,497
Cole's working
a cutting off Belvedere.

665
00:33:53,593 --> 00:33:55,150
Call Crutchfield
and see if he's back

666
00:33:55,171 --> 00:33:56,129
from the Westport scene.

667
00:33:56,156 --> 00:33:56,802
<i>Crutchfield. </i>

668
00:33:56,824 --> 00:33:57,957
If not, call Bunk at home.

669
00:33:58,201 --> 00:33:59,306
<i>It's his off day. </i>

670
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:00,509
Fuck his off-day.

671
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:08,413
I love this town.

672
00:34:15,684 --> 00:34:18,112
Maz's kinda quick
to yank a pitcher, ain't he?

673
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:25,574
I'm thinking
of becoming a woman.

674
00:34:34,751 --> 00:34:35,232
Office.

675
00:34:35,976 --> 00:34:36,381
Yeah.

676
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:40,396
I'm at the ball game.

677
00:34:42,211 --> 00:34:43,229
The ball game.

678
00:34:48,561 --> 00:34:50,016
Yeah, what about Cole?
Call him.

679
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,374
Ah, shit.

680
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,180
Alright.

681
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,604
Can you believe this?
They caught five tonight,

682
00:35:03,627 --> 00:35:05,746
they're telling me I gotta
come in on my day off.

683
00:35:06,744 --> 00:35:07,225
Five?

684
00:35:08,844 --> 00:35:10,364
City's jumpin' bad, man.

685
00:35:12,782 --> 00:35:13,865
Hey, listen,

686
00:35:15,495 --> 00:35:17,365
- I gotta go to work, alright?
- Alright.

687
00:35:19,531 --> 00:35:21,555
Mr. Jimmy's gonna...

688
00:35:23,075 --> 00:35:24,399
He's gonna take you home.

689
00:35:27,243 --> 00:35:28,512
You're on your own, partner.

690
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:32,672
Mee-maw.

691
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,471
And Ertman Avenue?

692
00:36:42,755 --> 00:36:44,112
No ballistic information.

693
00:36:45,414 --> 00:36:46,092
Are you sure?

694
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:49,374
Take your time, Major.

695
00:36:51,266 --> 00:36:53,115
Can you believe
that cocksucker Carcetti?

696
00:36:53,148 --> 00:36:54,723
Thinkin' I'm talkin'
out of school.

697
00:36:55,062 --> 00:36:56,331
Any day now, Marvin.

698
00:36:56,637 --> 00:36:58,223
What can a white
councilman give me

699
00:36:58,442 --> 00:36:59,766
that a black mayor can't?

700
00:37:00,674 --> 00:37:01,964
No, you played it right.

701
00:37:02,052 --> 00:37:04,885
It was a 38 recorded
on Ertman Avenue, Sir.

702
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:06,930
So what you are
in effect saying, Major,

703
00:37:07,171 --> 00:37:10,073
is rather than lookin'
at this cluster of robberies

704
00:37:10,117 --> 00:37:11,615
you had along
Monument Street,

705
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:15,127
you chose to investigate
each using separate personnel.

706
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:16,421
No, Sir.

707
00:37:16,441 --> 00:37:18,442
Three of those cases
were commercial robberies

708
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,204
so we sent those
downtown to C.I.D.

709
00:37:20,346 --> 00:37:22,498
My people had responsibility.

710
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:23,723
Goddamnit, Marvin,

711
00:37:24,095 --> 00:37:27,661
did you just invoke the word
responsibility to explain why

712
00:37:27,683 --> 00:37:29,477
you didn't get on
top of this shit?

713
00:37:29,587 --> 00:37:30,648
Did you just do that?

714
00:37:30,724 --> 00:37:32,717
I don't think you know
what the word means

715
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:35,659
when I look at
the 24s and plainly see

716
00:37:35,922 --> 00:37:39,499
that some 38 caliber asshole
is raping your entire district.

717
00:37:39,805 --> 00:37:43,546
All the way from Greenmount
to fucking Edison Highway.

718
00:37:43,802 --> 00:37:46,340
It's policing like that
makes it possible for us

719
00:37:46,362 --> 00:37:48,254
to get hit with
five fucking homicides

720
00:37:48,287 --> 00:37:50,147
in a single fucking
night people.

721
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:53,899
Poor fucking Marvin.

722
00:37:53,932 --> 00:37:55,162
Better him than us, right?

723
00:37:55,384 --> 00:37:56,524
Based on your testimony,

724
00:37:56,543 --> 00:37:58,392
the buy itself will be
enough to charge.

725
00:37:58,414 --> 00:38:00,202
But you get him saying
something on tape,

726
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:01,094
it's even better.

727
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,501
Are you sure this guy wants
to be selling you weight?

728
00:38:03,676 --> 00:38:05,133
We don't want to be forcing this.

729
00:38:05,308 --> 00:38:07,304
I been strokin' this guy
for two months, man.

730
00:38:07,693 --> 00:38:09,038
That's not what
he asked you.

731
00:38:09,213 --> 00:38:10,679
The guy is ripe
and ready, Kima.

732
00:38:11,478 --> 00:38:12,473
It ain't no thing.

733
00:38:16,158 --> 00:38:17,142
They're about ready.

734
00:38:20,205 --> 00:38:21,852
You livin' out
of the office, Cedric?

735
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:31,863
Alright. Drac is depending
on you people.

736
00:38:33,088 --> 00:38:33,755
Mount up.

737
00:38:40,004 --> 00:38:40,956
Find your way home.

738
00:38:49,353 --> 00:38:51,614
Look a little light to be
an ounce, don't you think?

739
00:38:51,672 --> 00:38:53,346
Naw, man,
ain't nuthin' light.

740
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,676
It just settled is all.

741
00:38:55,895 --> 00:38:57,612
Weight, man, if it
does what it should,

742
00:38:57,634 --> 00:39:00,503
I'ma come back to you
for three, maybe four a week.

743
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,422
That could work.

744
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:02,669
We good then.

745
00:39:03,697 --> 00:39:04,398
We good.

746
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:05,010
That's it.

747
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:05,940
Take 'em down.

748
00:39:25,648 --> 00:39:27,540
- Somebody snitchin'.
- Shut the fuck up!

749
00:39:31,348 --> 00:39:32,289
Let's go, Lavell.

750
00:39:47,046 --> 00:39:47,713
This Cutty.

751
00:39:48,939 --> 00:39:50,317
Told I could call for help.

752
00:39:52,203 --> 00:39:53,297
What 'bout the oxbow?

753
00:39:54,227 --> 00:39:56,119
The oxbow
on Laurens, at Fulton.

754
00:39:57,235 --> 00:39:57,596
A- ight.

755
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:10,380
<i>I'm sayin', they caught 'em
with a whole ounce. </i>

756
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,352
<i>Might not be no bail
for that much weight. </i>

757
00:40:12,374 --> 00:40:15,100
<i>They might just take it federal,
run wild on they ass. </i>

758
00:40:15,351 --> 00:40:18,152
<i>And you know Joey's gotta give
Lavell's corner to someone right?</i>

759
00:40:18,174 --> 00:40:19,246
<i>Might be my turn. </i>

760
00:40:19,279 --> 00:40:20,679
Our boy won't shut up.

761
00:40:21,423 --> 00:40:23,362
Caroline, you say it like
it's a bad thing.

762
00:40:24,369 --> 00:40:27,640
Let's just hope we're listening
to a candidate for elevation.

763
00:40:43,428 --> 00:40:44,577
I heard about you, man.

764
00:40:45,933 --> 00:40:47,509
I hear your name
used to ring out.

765
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:49,335
You got somethin' for me?

766
00:40:50,692 --> 00:40:52,551
You see where Shorty
sittin' right there,

767
00:40:53,342 --> 00:40:54,666
you find a little help.

768
00:40:55,092 --> 00:40:57,860
But when you ready, we got some
real work for ya, a-ight?

769
00:41:12,686 --> 00:41:13,270
Jesus.

770
00:41:29,846 --> 00:41:32,257
Hey, how you doing?

771
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,061
Okay.

772
00:41:45,397 --> 00:41:46,944
We were just talking about you.

773
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:47,886
Really?

774
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,445
You know Denise
from the sorority.

775
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,925
Charles of course.

776
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,207
- Always a pleasure Lieutenant.
- Good to see you.

777
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:56,275
And I don't think you've
ever met Delegate Watkins.

778
00:41:56,611 --> 00:41:58,832
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

779
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:01,503
We were saying you fill out
a lieutenant's uniform nicely.

780
00:42:02,154 --> 00:42:03,903
Makes an impression
on the campaign lit.

781
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,283
That matters?

782
00:42:06,314 --> 00:42:09,399
Marla's a new face taking
on a longtime incumbent.

783
00:42:09,466 --> 00:42:10,879
Everything matters, I'm afraid.

784
00:42:10,902 --> 00:42:12,382
Well, anything
I can do to help.

785
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:13,705
I'll, um...

786
00:42:14,524 --> 00:42:16,419
get out of the way
and leave you all to it.

787
00:42:21,264 --> 00:42:23,832
Marla, I have to tell you
that your photo with Cedric

788
00:42:23,866 --> 00:42:25,503
works really well
on the mailing.

789
00:42:25,828 --> 00:42:26,288
<i>Yeah. </i>

790
00:42:27,577 --> 00:42:29,772
<i>I sure hope he knows
what he's in for</i>

791
00:42:29,806 --> 00:42:32,542
<i>because it's going to be
a long race for the both of you. </i>

792
00:42:34,194 --> 00:42:36,313
<i>speaking of which,
you've got to make some... </i>

793
00:42:44,348 --> 00:42:46,715
Jesus, who called the media?

794
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:03,106
<i>Naw, you think
the man might respect</i>

795
00:43:03,128 --> 00:43:04,586
<i>my shit enough
to let me step up,</i>

796
00:43:04,608 --> 00:43:05,977
<i>but it ain't
even go like that. </i>

797
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:06,952
<i>Why not?</i>

798
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:10,025
<i>He gonna give Lavell's corners
to that off-brand nigga Cheese. </i>

799
00:43:10,064 --> 00:43:12,105
<i>An' you know what?
Joe my uncle an' shit. </i>

800
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,581
<i>I mean, I'm kin to
the fat motherfucker. </i>

801
00:43:14,996 --> 00:43:18,091
That idiot worked for us he'd
be a deputy commissioner by now.

802
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,833
Ain't no luck
at all to this case.

803
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,745
And how in all good
conscience can I,

804
00:43:26,846 --> 00:43:28,315
as chairman
of this subcommittee,

805
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,356
authorize anymore above-the-line
overtime.

806
00:43:30,412 --> 00:43:32,621
When it's clear enough
from the data in front of me

807
00:43:32,655 --> 00:43:34,819
that that money is not going
to go to line officers

808
00:43:34,853 --> 00:43:35,806
or working detectives.

809
00:43:35,818 --> 00:43:38,419
But is being to be paying
for drivers and clerical

810
00:43:38,442 --> 00:43:39,564
and Jesus look at this.

811
00:43:39,586 --> 00:43:42,614
So that two colonels
and three majors can attend

812
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:44,980
a community policing
seminar in Miami, Florida?

813
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:46,304
Mr. Chairman.

814
00:43:46,483 --> 00:43:48,726
What does South Beach
have to teach this department

815
00:43:48,737 --> 00:43:50,947
about making Baltimore
a safer place, Commissioner?

816
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:52,147
I have no idea

817
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:54,827
and you have no idea
and it is an embarrassment.

818
00:43:58,106 --> 00:43:58,700
<i>Cedric?</i>

819
00:43:59,653 --> 00:44:00,427
<i>They're gone. </i>

820
00:44:12,437 --> 00:44:13,873
I want to thank you for this.

821
00:44:14,534 --> 00:44:15,689
No problem.

822
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:17,989
It's not easy, I know.

823
00:44:18,153 --> 00:44:19,735
But they seem
to think it matters

824
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,069
that I present myself as...

825
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,337
I'm fine with it.

826
00:44:24,456 --> 00:44:26,475
All those years you were
all about my career,

827
00:44:28,393 --> 00:44:30,086
Well, it's the least
I can do, right?

828
00:44:34,493 --> 00:44:35,009
Goodnight.

829
00:44:42,455 --> 00:44:44,504
<i>We're not holding
anything up in his district. </i>

830
00:44:44,523 --> 00:44:47,636
<i>Repaving, foot patrols,
streetlights. </i>

831
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:49,706
<i>He's getting his share. </i>

832
00:44:51,546 --> 00:44:54,114
<i>Unless, it's not
about his district. </i>

833
00:44:55,864 --> 00:44:56,660
<i>It's about him. </i>

834
00:44:58,544 --> 00:45:00,356
<i>Maybe he's got
big eyes for something. </i>

835
00:45:01,646 --> 00:45:02,184
For what?

836
00:45:03,507 --> 00:45:06,502
Not me, not my chair.
Not in this town.

837
00:45:07,332 --> 00:45:07,725
Oh, no.

838
00:45:07,758 --> 00:45:10,125
If the man came off any whiter,
he'd be see-through.

839
00:45:10,786 --> 00:45:12,311
But, if that's it,
come on with it.

840
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:14,159
In fact, please Jesus.

841
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,855
<i>Or maybe John the Baptist. </i>

842
00:45:16,439 --> 00:45:17,942
Soften you up
for someone else.

843
00:45:18,323 --> 00:45:20,084
If he's gonna
bang us on crime.

844
00:45:20,128 --> 00:45:21,149
Bang me on crime.

845
00:45:22,641 --> 00:45:24,917
Look, is there any way
for you to talk to this guy?

846
00:45:25,444 --> 00:45:27,132
Keep him from
crawling up my ass?

847
00:45:27,165 --> 00:45:28,578
He's old first district.

848
00:45:29,408 --> 00:45:31,903
Not a lot of favors we can call
in over that side of town.

849
00:45:31,909 --> 00:45:33,748
So, we gotta show
him something, right?

850
00:45:33,771 --> 00:45:36,575
Four to five percent
drop in felonies.

851
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:37,467
And murders.

852
00:45:38,376 --> 00:45:41,572
Get the murders down
to under 250 for the year.

853
00:45:42,312 --> 00:45:45,419
All due respect,
Mr. Mayor, we're at 232 now.

854
00:45:46,428 --> 00:45:47,920
What can you
realistically do?

855
00:45:48,424 --> 00:45:51,005
Best case scenario,
if we bump the overtime

856
00:45:51,252 --> 00:45:53,629
is 275 maybe.

857
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:55,895
275, Christ.

858
00:45:56,366 --> 00:45:57,566
That's a promise, right?

859
00:45:58,811 --> 00:46:03,531
275 and this asshole
Carcetti has no issue.

860
00:46:20,572 --> 00:46:22,635
Gentlemen,
the word from on high

861
00:46:22,647 --> 00:46:25,069
is that felony rates
district by district

862
00:46:25,428 --> 00:46:28,849
will decline by five percent
before the end of the year.

863
00:46:28,929 --> 00:46:30,286
We are dealing in certainties.

864
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:32,338
You will reduce
the U.C.R. felonies

865
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:34,133
by five percent or more, or...

866
00:46:34,985 --> 00:46:36,612
I've always wanted
to say this...

867
00:46:37,363 --> 00:46:38,944
let no man come back alive.

868
00:46:39,236 --> 00:46:43,738
In addition, we will hold this
year's murders to 275 or less.

869
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,209
Christ.

870
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,529
Feeling a little fazed,
Colonel Foerster?

871
00:46:48,684 --> 00:46:49,783
A little dyspeptic?

872
00:46:50,388 --> 00:46:50,974
Dis-who?

873
00:46:51,513 --> 00:46:52,029
No, Sir.

874
00:46:53,116 --> 00:46:53,868
I'm good to go.

875
00:46:56,514 --> 00:46:57,939
He's a fun fact
for you people:

876
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:00,355
If Baltimore had
New York's population,

877
00:47:00,378 --> 00:47:02,627
we'd be clocking 4000 murders
a year at this rate.

878
00:47:02,952 --> 00:47:04,634
There is no excuse
I will except.

879
00:47:05,094 --> 00:47:06,227
I don't care how you do it,

880
00:47:06,922 --> 00:47:07,819
just fucking do it.

881
00:47:09,418 --> 00:47:10,276
Deputy, as familiar

882
00:47:10,277 --> 00:47:12,850
as we all are with the urban
crime environment,

883
00:47:13,411 --> 00:47:17,056
I think we all understand
there's certain processes,

884
00:47:17,546 --> 00:47:20,016
by which you can reduce
the number of overall felonies.

885
00:47:20,058 --> 00:47:22,311
You can re-classify
an agg assault

886
00:47:22,312 --> 00:47:24,095
or you can
unfound a robbery.

887
00:47:24,151 --> 00:47:26,865
But, how do you
make a body disappear?

888
00:47:29,557 --> 00:47:31,229
There is not
one of you in this room

889
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,731
who isn't here
by appointment.

890
00:47:33,673 --> 00:47:36,971
If you want to continue
wearing those oak clusters,

891
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:39,856
you will shut up
and step up.

892
00:47:39,946 --> 00:47:42,099
Any of you who can't bring
the numbers we need

893
00:47:42,121 --> 00:47:44,510
will be replaced
by someone who can.

894
00:47:47,807 --> 00:47:48,525
That is all.

895
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:51,609
Jesus, Bunny.

896
00:47:52,529 --> 00:47:53,863
What got into you?

897
00:47:54,682 --> 00:47:56,105
I got six months to my 30,

898
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:57,844
I'm out the door
on a major's pension.

899
00:47:58,371 --> 00:47:59,639
The hell can they do to me?

900
00:48:04,492 --> 00:48:06,062
<i>Spider bags, red tops. </i>

901
00:48:35,317 --> 00:48:36,741
Any other bright ideas?

902
00:48:36,932 --> 00:48:38,587
- How about a bug?
- A bug?

903
00:48:39,574 --> 00:48:42,457
Yeah, bug one or two of the big
corners where these mopes hang.

904
00:48:42,703 --> 00:48:44,879
Watchin' those corners
over on Ashland yesterday,

905
00:48:44,901 --> 00:48:48,086
I'm seeing dumpsters,
weeds, maybe utility poles.

906
00:48:48,686 --> 00:48:50,200
You hide a bug
on the right corner

907
00:48:50,211 --> 00:48:51,893
at the right moment
you make this case.

908
00:48:51,916 --> 00:48:54,338
We don't have the manpower.
Not to mention the money.

909
00:48:54,966 --> 00:48:55,751
And for what?

910
00:48:55,908 --> 00:48:58,095
We're still a long way
from a quality target.

911
00:48:58,196 --> 00:49:01,323
I say we come down off the wire,
charge what we can and move on.

912
00:49:01,727 --> 00:49:03,465
We come down early
two years ago

913
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:05,304
and we left a real bastard
on the street.

914
00:49:05,338 --> 00:49:06,862
You're telling me
we're gonna let

915
00:49:06,863 --> 00:49:08,523
that same sonofabitch
beat me again?

916
00:49:08,736 --> 00:49:10,390
How many times
do you let a cocksucker

917
00:49:10,412 --> 00:49:12,086
like Stringer Bell
go 'round the board?

918
00:49:12,097 --> 00:49:13,776
Collect another
fuckin' 200 million.

919
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,236
There's other fish
in the barrel, McNulty.

920
00:49:17,259 --> 00:49:18,708
Stringer's the target.

921
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:20,809
There isn't a better
motherfucker out there,

922
00:49:20,821 --> 00:49:21,881
you know it, Lieutenant.

923
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,211
Don't you let him
go soft on this.

924
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:32,194
It's you against
the world, is it?

925
00:49:38,501 --> 00:49:39,589
What the fuck did I do?

926
00:49:41,731 --> 00:49:42,965
<i>Red tops! Spider bags!</i>

927
00:49:43,638 --> 00:49:44,142
You up?

928
00:49:56,195 --> 00:49:57,564
Step the fuck off,
motherfucker.

929
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,175
You got a need you
talk to one of the younguns.

930
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:03,541
I ain't in the market.
I'm sellin'.

931
00:50:04,561 --> 00:50:07,085
You look like the right person
to be talkin' to, chief.

932
00:50:07,455 --> 00:50:09,698
You seem like you steady
runnin' this shit here.

933
00:50:10,752 --> 00:50:12,771
What, you some kind
of police or somethin'?

934
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:15,474
I'm a long motherfuckin'
way from the police.

935
00:50:15,698 --> 00:50:18,166
I just finished
a 14 year bit in Jessup.

936
00:50:18,637 --> 00:50:21,564
Got a package as
a comin' home present.

937
00:50:22,012 --> 00:50:22,730
G- pack.

938
00:50:23,392 --> 00:50:25,115
Why not sell that shit
your own self?

939
00:50:25,399 --> 00:50:26,768
I just came home.

940
00:50:26,913 --> 00:50:28,708
I ain't tryin' to get
my ass violated.

941
00:50:31,164 --> 00:50:32,768
- Even split.
- Sheet.

942
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:34,744
It's all profit to you.

943
00:50:35,069 --> 00:50:36,213
Risk mine, too.

944
00:50:36,718 --> 00:50:39,118
What make you think
I ain't on paper or someshit?

945
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:40,172
60/40.

946
00:50:45,656 --> 00:50:46,127
Cool.

947
00:50:47,293 --> 00:50:48,650
Give your shit to my boy.

948
00:50:49,828 --> 00:50:51,578
He good with it,
then come past tonight.

949
00:50:51,858 --> 00:50:52,262
A'ight.

950
00:50:55,492 --> 00:50:57,073
<i>And one last item
for you gents. </i>

951
00:50:57,533 --> 00:50:59,910
It seems foxtrot was hovering
over the station house

952
00:50:59,921 --> 00:51:01,815
a few days ago
and caught a lovely view

953
00:51:01,837 --> 00:51:05,179
of about seven or 800 discarded
beer cans on the garage roof.

954
00:51:05,976 --> 00:51:08,981
<i>Seriously, no off-duty
drinking on the station lot</i>

955
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,504
and if you do find
yourself holding a beer can

956
00:51:11,515 --> 00:51:13,691
don't throw it on the roof,
take it home with you.

957
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:16,965
Come on, guys,
the memo came down

958
00:51:16,977 --> 00:51:18,861
from our beloved Deputy
of Operations.

959
00:51:20,476 --> 00:51:22,394
Alright, get outta here.

960
00:51:23,683 --> 00:51:24,771
<i>Don't get captured. </i>

961
00:51:29,885 --> 00:51:30,551
At ease.

962
00:51:33,568 --> 00:51:34,712
Anything from day shift?

963
00:51:35,082 --> 00:51:36,507
Nothing that'll make the papers.

964
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,660
Alright then.
I'm gonna ride the district

965
00:51:38,682 --> 00:51:40,118
until the Deputy Major gets in.

966
00:51:40,185 --> 00:51:41,454
If you need me, hit the radio.

967
00:51:44,729 --> 00:51:45,592
Distribution?

968
00:51:47,588 --> 00:51:48,374
Possession,

969
00:51:49,417 --> 00:51:50,370
and some loitering.

970
00:51:51,076 --> 00:51:51,765
Loitering?

971
00:51:52,584 --> 00:51:53,682
And behaving like assles

972
00:51:53,683 --> 00:51:55,668
in the presence
of sworn officers, boss.

973
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:09,975
5-0 creepin'!

974
00:53:23,316 --> 00:53:25,346
Midnight relief comin' in.

975
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:54,520
The hell is all this?

976
00:53:56,987 --> 00:53:58,636
You don't look at
what you did before,

977
00:53:58,669 --> 00:53:59,970
you do the same shit
all over.

978
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:02,580
I'm outta here.

979
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:56,776
Where he at?

980
00:55:20,654 --> 00:55:21,697
The fuck you lookin' at?

981
00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:23,907
Huh?

982
00:55:25,881 --> 00:55:26,924
What, you want a go?

983
00:55:27,396 --> 00:55:28,315
Just my split.

984
00:55:29,908 --> 00:55:31,209
Some bad luck there.

985
00:55:32,241 --> 00:55:35,684
Poh-leece came through snatched
up a grod stash or two.

986
00:55:35,885 --> 00:55:37,388
Shit happened to be yours.

987
00:55:38,218 --> 00:55:38,946
Fuck, right?

988
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:41,077
You got a number?

989
00:55:41,593 --> 00:55:42,142
A number?

990
00:55:42,938 --> 00:55:44,791
Back in the day,
when a player tried to say

991
00:55:44,813 --> 00:55:46,516
he lost a package
to the police,

992
00:55:46,965 --> 00:55:49,017
he had to give up
a number for the report.

993
00:55:50,115 --> 00:55:51,449
We ain't back in the day.

994
00:55:53,176 --> 00:55:55,408
I'm gettin' fuckin'
tired of your ass.

995
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:09,303
Yeah, walk it off,
motherfucker.

996
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:13,074
Fuckin' old school ass bitch.

997
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:34,455
Got them spider bags.

998
00:56:34,926 --> 00:56:36,047
Two get you three.

999
00:56:36,081 --> 00:56:36,630
What?

1000
00:56:37,202 --> 00:56:37,920
You up?

1001
00:56:38,582 --> 00:56:39,378
Spider bags.

1002
00:56:39,636 --> 00:56:40,578
Two gets three.

1003
00:56:42,664 --> 00:56:44,366
You up or you not?

1004
00:56:55,092 --> 00:56:56,326
<i>Don't you know five-o?</i>
