1
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:25,727
<i>W.M.D. Got them W.M.D.</i>

2
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,357
You better move it on down.

3
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:29,538
It ain't pretty.

4
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:31,602
It doesn't have to be.

5
00:01:33,995 --> 00:01:37,198
It just needs to pull them
from the places still worth salvaging.

6
00:01:39,758 --> 00:01:40,227
Alright.

7
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:43,641
I told the other shifts

8
00:01:43,957 --> 00:01:45,248
now I'm telling you:

9
00:01:46,245 --> 00:01:48,450
When I ride my district
at the end of this week

10
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:50,370
I want to see empty corners.

11
00:01:51,906 --> 00:01:54,745
They bring it here,
or the other two free-zones

12
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,563
or you bang them senseless.

13
00:01:57,525 --> 00:01:59,683
Anything you need to do, you do.

14
00:02:00,358 --> 00:02:03,290
Up to a body that can't walk
itself out of an emergency room

15
00:02:03,572 --> 00:02:04,968
I'll back up you and your men.

16
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:06,047
You understand me?

17
00:02:06,528 --> 00:02:10,000
Now,'ve detailed our I.I.D. representative
to the range for the entire week.

18
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,574
All citizen complaints will be handled
by Lieutenant Mello here.

19
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:17,598
Whatever it takes.

20
00:02:18,243 --> 00:02:19,639
Man, I ain't even dirty.

21
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:20,906
I got rights an' shit.

22
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,722
Go with the one
about staying silent.

23
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:33,349
Shit like this
don't happen in Hamsterdam.

24
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,510
You gonna humble us
for just standin' somewhere?

25
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:38,859
Fuck y'all!
We in america.

26
00:02:40,356 --> 00:02:41,354
West Baltimore.

27
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:46,116
I swear to god, officer Herc

28
00:02:46,808 --> 00:02:48,036
you unhook babycakes

29
00:02:48,412 --> 00:02:50,394
and my peoples be
down where you want us.

30
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:51,133
Swear to god.

31
00:02:56,892 --> 00:02:59,445
Fuck with a man's ride,
you're gonna get his attention.

32
00:02:59,551 --> 00:03:00,243
Babycakes?

33
00:03:00,278 --> 00:03:01,404
Yo, yo, yo, hold up.

34
00:03:05,392 --> 00:03:07,902
Motherfuckers gonna hear
from my motherfuckin' lawyer.

35
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,927
This right here
is some outrageous shit.

36
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,502
You think?

37
00:03:12,683 --> 00:03:14,220
Fuck y'all lyin' motherfuckers.

38
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:18,760
Gentlemen.

39
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:31,995
That is outrageous.

40
00:04:09,524 --> 00:04:10,533
Come on, sweetheart.

41
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:12,855
Bust your ass out of here.

42
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:21,435
Still Maryland.

43
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:25,173
But if y'all don't take that shit
down to Hamsterdam tomorrow

44
00:04:25,244 --> 00:04:27,038
the next time
it's gonna be West Virginia.

45
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,572
That little star right there?
Across from the dipper?

46
00:04:29,912 --> 00:04:30,745
That's north.

47
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:33,288
You wanna go the other way.

48
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,203
Assholes.

49
00:06:25,413 --> 00:06:26,591
Homecoming

50
00:06:58,009 --> 00:06:59,897
<i>Landfills, got Landfills. </i>

51
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:14,157
<i>W.M.D. Got that W.M.D.</i>

52
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,199
We'll start the interior
construction within the week.

53
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:24,158
Which means we need
to readdress the budget.

54
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:24,839
Readdress how?

55
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,196
Well, for one, the price
of steel has doubled.

56
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,803
It'll triple
if we don't buy it now.

57
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:31,337
- Ain't the steel bought already?
- Not the bulk of it, no.

58
00:07:31,357 --> 00:07:34,630
And then there are the gutting costs.
They exceeded our original expectations.

59
00:07:34,642 --> 00:07:36,565
He needs to wear
the hat when he's on-site.

60
00:07:36,601 --> 00:07:37,762
Code, you know.

61
00:07:39,906 --> 00:07:41,232
Gutting costs went up, huh?

62
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:42,815
That was due to your modifications.

63
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,821
The changes you asked for
in those loft units.

64
00:07:44,845 --> 00:07:46,405
Necessitating new permits.

65
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:47,660
Which means another delay.

66
00:07:47,695 --> 00:07:48,548
Unless we expedite.

67
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:51,023
Bring the architect and his
people back in over the weekend

68
00:07:51,046 --> 00:07:52,782
and get something
to the city on monday.

69
00:07:52,794 --> 00:07:54,647
Whoa, man, that part
of his original fee?

70
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:55,985
No, this was unanticipated.

71
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:58,949
Look, y'all fucked up,
so y'all supposed to take the hit, right?

72
00:07:59,008 --> 00:07:59,946
Excuse me?

73
00:08:00,016 --> 00:08:02,456
I mean, my man here don't know
shit about no gutting costs

74
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,626
he don't know nothing
about no price of no steel.

75
00:08:04,638 --> 00:08:06,456
He just tryin'
to get some shit built

76
00:08:07,146 --> 00:08:09,469
and y'all supposed to have
expertise behind this.

77
00:08:09,551 --> 00:08:11,686
Only what I'm sayin' is
it seem like the expertise

78
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:13,152
ain't where it supposed to be.

79
00:08:13,234 --> 00:08:14,459
Unfortunately, Mr. Barksdale

80
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:16,500
cost overruns are
the nature of the business.

81
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:18,624
We should discuss
this over lunch.

82
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,559
Ah, hell no, man,
I got elsewhere to be.

83
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,495
This is the Marlo kid.

84
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:31,026
He's fresh blood for the organization.
Bell's given him the best real estate.

85
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:33,260
The Barksdale people
took what they needed

86
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:34,971
when the towers
came down, no problem.

87
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:36,473
Stringer hasn't missed a step.

88
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:38,361
He's still selling drugs.

89
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,312
Lotta drugs.

90
00:08:39,546 --> 00:08:40,837
He's not dropping bodies.

91
00:08:40,907 --> 00:08:43,805
Nah, he doesn't need to.
He's got all the corners he needs.

92
00:08:44,638 --> 00:08:46,139
And I'm supposed to give a shit?

93
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:47,523
Lieutenant, two weeks

94
00:08:48,157 --> 00:08:49,412
Bell looked insulated

95
00:08:49,693 --> 00:08:52,767
like he had enough legitimate front
to be able to be just the bank.

96
00:08:53,048 --> 00:08:55,960
What Kima's found out is he's still
directly involved with the drugs.

97
00:08:56,031 --> 00:08:58,517
Otherwise, why the face-to-face
with the Stanfield kid?

98
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:00,465
He's still connected
to the day-to-day.

99
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:03,769
We come back six, eight months

100
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:06,021
you won't even get him
in a room talking drugs

101
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,018
much less handling any.

102
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:08,485
It's now or never, Lieutenant.

103
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,909
Stringer Bell is quiet.

104
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:20,596
And if he's quiet

105
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:23,527
I don't give a fuck
if we come back a year from now

106
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:25,896
and find out he's on
the greater Baltimore committee.

107
00:09:26,143 --> 00:09:28,325
This unit is about the bodies.

108
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,115
<i>Major Forrester, call two-four-six-two.
Major Forrester. </i>

109
00:09:51,568 --> 00:09:52,917
What the fuck is this?

110
00:09:53,422 --> 00:09:55,870
Ten-page report
on the heroic police work

111
00:09:56,902 --> 00:10:00,081
undertaken to retrieve officer
Dozerman's service weapon.

112
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:07,084
Send that upstairs, keep the bosses
outta your ass for a while.

113
00:10:07,495 --> 00:10:09,407
You actually did all this?

114
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,797
Would it matter if I had?

115
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:16,178
Jay

116
00:10:18,371 --> 00:10:19,533
I'm a murder police

117
00:10:20,178 --> 00:10:21,585
I got a double on my plate.

118
00:10:22,676 --> 00:10:23,744
I'm gonna work it.

119
00:10:34,618 --> 00:10:36,635
We ain't got Fayette
and Poppleton neither?

120
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:37,454
What the fuck?

121
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,671
I'm workin' on it, man.
The avenue corners, too.

122
00:10:39,695 --> 00:10:41,443
What you mean
you workin' on it, man?

123
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:43,836
Why we ain't at least have
a shop setup down the block?

124
00:10:43,871 --> 00:10:44,340
We did.

125
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:46,229
There was a setback.

126
00:10:46,874 --> 00:10:48,211
Ran our boys off.

127
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:49,312
Who?

128
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:51,939
- Just some player, man.
- Listen.

129
00:10:53,241 --> 00:10:55,623
Let him tell me.
We hire him for muscle.

130
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:56,796
The boy, Marlo.

131
00:10:57,617 --> 00:11:00,804
Marlo, who the fuck is Marlo?
He tied into one of the mobs?

132
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:01,860
Young boy.

133
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:03,420
Runnin' it on his own, too.

134
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:07,256
Got maybe 15 spots
along here and the avenue.

135
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:11,257
An independent with
no fuckin' support?

136
00:11:11,316 --> 00:11:13,955
Got all the prime real estate
and we doin' what exactly?

137
00:11:16,219 --> 00:11:18,026
Young boy ran us
off the corner.

138
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:21,694
I'm losing
my motherfuckin' mind, man.

139
00:11:27,113 --> 00:11:29,482
And I sincerely mean
your girl no disrespect but...

140
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:34,199
Tosha wasn't killed because
she just happened by that mess.

141
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,252
I think we all know that, right?

142
00:11:37,472 --> 00:11:38,481
She was a player.

143
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:40,217
We know that much.

144
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,513
We got the science
that says she'd fired a gun

145
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:44,557
when it all went down.

146
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:46,747
Gun wasn't there for us to find

147
00:11:46,794 --> 00:11:49,128
but that just means someone
grabbed it up, right?

148
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,744
I mean, your girl she, uh...

149
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:54,227
definitely had her say

150
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,878
when everybody else
on that street was talking.

151
00:11:57,969 --> 00:11:58,954
Am I wrong?

152
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:04,065
Well, I got witnesses
on the scene that said

153
00:12:04,077 --> 00:12:06,376
she was there right in
the middle of a drug robbery.

154
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:08,487
Boy by the name a' Omar
was in on it, too.

155
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,666
Nobody saying Tosha was an angel.

156
00:12:12,796 --> 00:12:13,852
Nobody saying that.

157
00:12:17,723 --> 00:12:19,049
But what are they saying?

158
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,676
The crew Tosha was runnin' with

159
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,222
maybe they didn't throw
the shot that killed her.

160
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,916
But if they don't come to me
early and tell the true story

161
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:29,849
I guarantee they won't
breathe a free breath

162
00:12:29,872 --> 00:12:32,125
until them cicadas come back.

163
00:12:38,823 --> 00:12:40,500
Y'all get the word
to the right people.

164
00:12:49,545 --> 00:12:51,973
And you've spoken to
the medical examiner, correct?

165
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:52,806
What's he say?

166
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:55,324
He says it's lumpy.

167
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:57,470
Lumpy?

168
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:01,001
He says if an investigation
can come up with a credible scenario

169
00:13:01,025 --> 00:13:03,547
he's willing to change
the cause of death to homicide.

170
00:13:03,594 --> 00:13:05,385
Do you even have a suspect here?

171
00:13:08,693 --> 00:13:10,711
Look, I don't know
how you city guys do it.

172
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:13,280
But down here in Annapolis,
we try to duck a punch or two.

173
00:13:13,297 --> 00:13:14,775
Not lean into every last one.

174
00:13:15,842 --> 00:13:17,743
My county doesn't
need another murder.

175
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:41,138
I'm glad you could came.

176
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:44,628
Ladies, Reverend Wright

177
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,809
I'd like you to meet
my husband, Cedric Daniels.

178
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:47,595
Nice to meet you.

179
00:13:48,217 --> 00:13:49,308
Not that I've seen, no.

180
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:52,287
- She was invited, right?
- Oh, of course.

181
00:13:52,534 --> 00:13:54,506
Eunetta doesn't make it
too much nowadays.

182
00:13:54,576 --> 00:13:55,738
Not even council meetings.

183
00:13:56,289 --> 00:13:59,362
I think Eunetta's gonna have her
hands full come the primary.

184
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,295
Mayor will pull her through.

185
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:04,277
He still have coattails?

186
00:14:04,394 --> 00:14:05,696
Sheeeeet, boy.

187
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,265
You look up incumbent
in the damn dictionary

188
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:11,057
and you'll see Clarence
Royce smiling back at you.

189
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:13,110
He gets his whole ticket through.

190
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:16,311
Mayor's got a new poll
showing his negatives

191
00:14:16,695 --> 00:14:18,654
they've really jumped
in the last year.

192
00:14:19,511 --> 00:14:22,478
Not that he's gonna be putting
a press release out about that.

193
00:14:23,347 --> 00:14:25,623
I hear you took a swipe
at Hizzoner the other day

194
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:26,819
on that witness murder.

195
00:14:26,855 --> 00:14:28,074
Not at the mayor directly.

196
00:14:28,508 --> 00:14:31,265
But we had the police brass in
front of the subcommittee and

197
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,593
I dunno, there's just
no excuse for what happened.

198
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,388
You keep on it, Councilman.

199
00:14:36,693 --> 00:14:38,206
A little smack here and there

200
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,189
does this administration
a world of good.

201
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:44,236
That's why we need
new blood on the Council.

202
00:14:44,978 --> 00:14:46,961
Keep everybody honest.

203
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:06,086
Don't embarrass yourself.

204
00:15:09,664 --> 00:15:10,192
So...

205
00:15:12,092 --> 00:15:14,075
your murder's never
gonna be a murder

206
00:15:14,098 --> 00:15:16,370
and Daniels's got his head
all up in another case.

207
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,842
You know what the hardest part
of being a police is?

208
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:23,100
Yeah, explaining to your wife why

209
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,646
she has to take antibiotics
for your kidney infection.

210
00:15:29,423 --> 00:15:32,003
I was gonna say trying to make
the job actually matter.

211
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:33,037
That too.

212
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,066
Speaking of your ex wife,
what's up there?

213
00:15:39,395 --> 00:15:39,993
Nothing.

214
00:15:41,588 --> 00:15:43,031
She's got her hooks in some lawyer.

215
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:44,500
Money guy.

216
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:46,400
Fuck it and fuck her.

217
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:48,758
So what, you movin' on?

218
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,661
Yeah, I might have some fresh
hope, now that you mention it.

219
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:01,913
Yeah, there's this woman
at this thing for my kids.

220
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:05,393
She, like, raises money
for the school and all that.

221
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:05,816
You know.

222
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:09,957
She's got a face, a body and
a brain all working together.

223
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,385
And she looks
like the kind who might

224
00:16:12,901 --> 00:16:15,632
tell me when my shit stinks,
which is probably what I need.

225
00:16:17,134 --> 00:16:18,776
She's kinda like Freamon with tits.

226
00:16:21,157 --> 00:16:22,717
So what, you get her number?

227
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:24,437
No, not exactly.

228
00:16:24,742 --> 00:16:26,865
Hey, what kinda detective
would I be if I couldn't

229
00:16:26,888 --> 00:16:28,765
track a white woman
in Baltimore, right?

230
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:32,941
There you go.

231
00:16:42,216 --> 00:16:43,882
You were so smooth tonight.

232
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:47,767
You had them eating
right out of your hand.

233
00:16:48,952 --> 00:16:50,652
It's what you need from me, right?

234
00:16:53,257 --> 00:16:54,500
Anyway, it wasn't too bad.

235
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:57,239
I'm getting better at it, I guess.

236
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:58,283
You are.

237
00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:09,434
Cedric. Maybe we could...

238
00:17:11,557 --> 00:17:12,284
I don't know.

239
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,148
Right now

240
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,233
you tell me where you need me

241
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:23,347
and whether you want the class
"a" or the class "b" uniform.

242
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,074
And I'm there.

243
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:31,638
More than that, I just don't know.

244
00:17:40,428 --> 00:17:40,851
So.

245
00:17:43,924 --> 00:17:44,311
So.

246
00:17:46,747 --> 00:17:47,780
I'm sayin' what the fuck?

247
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:53,140
Take a deep breath, man.

248
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:56,762
I mean take a long deep breath

249
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:59,002
and know that if you call the shot,
we at war

250
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,234
we at war.

251
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,134
I'm there like I always been.

252
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,636
Thing about turf, man,
it ain't like it was.

253
00:18:11,915 --> 00:18:14,883
I mean you ain't got to pay
no price of buying no corners.

254
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:21,602
Since when do we buy corners?

255
00:18:22,294 --> 00:18:23,713
We take corners.

256
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:26,423
Man, you gonna buy
one way or another.

257
00:18:26,963 --> 00:18:29,805
Whether it's the bodies that
we done lost or you gonna lose

258
00:18:30,556 --> 00:18:32,937
time in the joint that's
behind us or ahead of us.

259
00:18:32,949 --> 00:18:35,225
I mean, you gonna
get some shit in this game

260
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:36,808
but it ain't shit for free.

261
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,051
I mean how many
corners do we need?

262
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:45,408
How much money can a nigger make?

263
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,039
More than a nigger can spend.

264
00:18:47,098 --> 00:18:49,910
And we ain't gonna be around
to spend what we done made already.

265
00:18:49,992 --> 00:18:52,455
Shit, I didn't think I was
gonna be around this long.

266
00:18:55,751 --> 00:18:56,807
Well, we here now.

267
00:18:58,358 --> 00:19:01,067
The fact is we got
every mob in town:

268
00:19:01,103 --> 00:19:03,120
Eastside, Westside,
ready to pull together

269
00:19:04,082 --> 00:19:07,155
share territory on that good shit
that Prop Joe puttin' out there.

270
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,696
We take the shit downtown
and we get in the money game

271
00:19:09,697 --> 00:19:11,316
that niggers ain't going to jail.

272
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:15,254
I mean, we past
that run and gun shit, man.

273
00:19:15,277 --> 00:19:17,647
Like we fund us a package

274
00:19:17,682 --> 00:19:19,629
and we ain't got to see
nothing but bank.

275
00:19:20,051 --> 00:19:22,562
Nothing but cash.
No corners, no territory, nothing.

276
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:26,132
We make so much got-damn
straight money, man.

277
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:28,045
The government come after us, man

278
00:19:29,053 --> 00:19:30,555
ain't shit they can say.

279
00:19:31,528 --> 00:19:32,654
Businessmen, huh?

280
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,285
Let the younguns
worry about how to retail

281
00:19:38,775 --> 00:19:39,783
we're the wholesale.

282
00:19:41,144 --> 00:19:43,854
I mean, who gives a fuck
who's standing on what corner

283
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:46,174
if we're taking
that shit off the top

284
00:19:47,148 --> 00:19:48,508
putting that shit to good use

285
00:19:49,212 --> 00:19:50,784
makin' that shit work for us?

286
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,869
We could run more than corners, B.

287
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:55,429
Period.

288
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,487
We could do like
Little Willie, man

289
00:19:59,488 --> 00:20:01,588
back in the day,
with all that number money.

290
00:20:02,163 --> 00:20:03,781
And run this got-damn city.

291
00:20:11,704 --> 00:20:12,842
Like businessmen.

292
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:21,927
Man, just lemme talk to the boy, Marlo,
see if I can't smooth this shit out.

293
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,456
I mean it ain't gonna be overnight

294
00:20:23,457 --> 00:20:25,381
cuz the nigger already
knows what he knows.

295
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,018
But I think I could

296
00:20:28,513 --> 00:20:29,779
talk some sense in his head.

297
00:20:34,658 --> 00:20:36,945
Yeah, I ain't no suitman,
businessman, like you.

298
00:20:38,482 --> 00:20:40,699
You know, I'm just
a gangster, I suppose.

299
00:20:42,629 --> 00:20:43,779
And I want my corners.

300
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,038
<i>I've gotta tell ya</i>

301
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:55,173
<i>I'm having a tough time </i>

302
00:20:55,197 --> 00:20:57,719
<i>wrapping my head around the
reality of you being paroled. </i>

303
00:20:58,129 --> 00:21:01,343
<i>Trust me, I won't fully comprehend it
until I'm sipping my first martini. </i>

304
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,088
<i>Toby, I'm... </i>

305
00:21:07,246 --> 00:21:09,217
Homide police
went to Tosha's people.

306
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:11,786
Talking about how
they know she was in the mix.

307
00:21:11,915 --> 00:21:15,126
Sayin' they got witnesses an' shit.
They called your name on it, too.

308
00:21:20,826 --> 00:21:22,565
- So what they say?
- They called me.

309
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,227
Hey, yo, I know this cop, man.

310
00:21:26,013 --> 00:21:27,304
Maybe we should help him out.

311
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,403
Tell him who did what.

312
00:21:29,474 --> 00:21:30,905
Yo, stop wallin', Kimmy.

313
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:32,746
A- ight, now I said I got this.

314
00:21:32,817 --> 00:21:35,659
Tosha's people want to know from me
exactly what happened that day.

315
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:36,633
That's all I'm saying.

316
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:39,319
Well tell 'em she caught one tryin'
to take the boys down, man.

317
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,595
Ain't no need to involve
the police in none of this.

318
00:21:41,606 --> 00:21:43,237
Sound to me like
he involved already.

319
00:21:43,245 --> 00:21:44,746
Kimmy, I told you, I got this.

320
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:46,412
<i>Time!</i>

321
00:21:47,421 --> 00:21:48,054
<i>Asshole. </i>

322
00:21:59,397 --> 00:22:02,822
My husband worked for
Mr. Cooper at the american can.

323
00:22:03,397 --> 00:22:04,628
He made good money.

324
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,495
We saved up and bought this house.

325
00:22:08,446 --> 00:22:11,707
There were some white families
still living in the neighborhood then.

326
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,064
The neighborhood
has changed, Mrs. Hazel.

327
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,599
This is a picture of the house.

328
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,916
City owned, taxes paid and all.

329
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:27,725
It is very nice.

330
00:22:30,153 --> 00:22:31,479
But I can't afford that.

331
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:33,391
You don't have
to worry about the money.

332
00:22:33,637 --> 00:22:34,798
It's all taken care of.

333
00:22:35,866 --> 00:22:37,610
This is a special program we have.

334
00:22:37,845 --> 00:22:44,062
It's for people who are living
in really bad situations

335
00:22:44,672 --> 00:22:46,830
with the drug trafficking
you see outside.

336
00:22:48,191 --> 00:22:51,593
And this is a good neighborhood.

337
00:22:52,355 --> 00:22:55,440
It's safe and it's on
the number 19 line.

338
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,184
And it's walkin'
distance from your church.

339
00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:04,368
Officer, this is
the only home I know.

340
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,151
It's all I got.

341
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:10,945
Now you say you have a program
that can place me somewhere else.

342
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:14,323
But you ain't got no program
for what's outside my door?

343
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,395
You weren't lying.

344
00:23:32,571 --> 00:23:33,075
I told you.

345
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:35,433
And I've been all over
these blocks like you said.

346
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:38,072
I haven't seen any cameras,
nobody peekin'.

347
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:41,348
And monk man
and his crew been here

348
00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:43,881
for grindin' for days
and knockers ain't even blinked.

349
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:45,172
Tell you what.

350
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,890
Send my people over.
Not too many.

351
00:23:48,949 --> 00:23:50,157
Just some of the younguns.

352
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:53,678
Keep the package real small,
in case it's a trap.

353
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,977
I'ma hear directly
from you on this.

354
00:23:56,845 --> 00:23:57,385
I'm on it.

355
00:23:59,848 --> 00:24:01,819
Shit is just bugged out, you know?

356
00:24:09,422 --> 00:24:11,621
String called, said to tell you
he's gonna be late

357
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:13,780
behind something he needed
to see down the way.

358
00:24:19,305 --> 00:24:20,654
So what you tellin' me we weak?

359
00:24:20,712 --> 00:24:22,472
Boss, I reached out to Black Donnie.

360
00:24:24,161 --> 00:24:27,141
Okay, spit it out, man.
Listen, stop fucking double talkin' me.

361
00:24:28,726 --> 00:24:30,919
Black Donnie said
he ain't having any of it.

362
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,488
Said Brother Mouzone
put a hex on all of us.

363
00:24:34,802 --> 00:24:35,741
What 'bout Peacock?

364
00:24:36,092 --> 00:24:38,521
Peacock when a hired
out some dominicans.

365
00:24:39,815 --> 00:24:40,882
What about Eggy Mule?

366
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:42,032
Eggy locked up.

367
00:24:42,044 --> 00:24:44,331
Caught a nickel
with the feds for a pistol.

368
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,947
How 'bout Shorty Boyd?

369
00:24:48,472 --> 00:24:50,944
Shorty Boyd went
and cleaned his whole ack' up.

370
00:24:53,337 --> 00:24:55,413
Yeah, I know. Fucked us all up.

371
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,583
What we got?

372
00:24:59,014 --> 00:25:02,123
Soldier you sent at us, Cutty,
he gonna work out

373
00:25:02,295 --> 00:25:04,641
but the rest of them dudes,
I dunno.

374
00:25:05,685 --> 00:25:06,799
A- ight, listen big man,

375
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,403
you about to earn your fuckin'
keep around here right now.

376
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,334
You go out, you get Cutty

377
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:14,020
and get the best of the rest
and put a hurtin' on Marlo.

378
00:25:14,044 --> 00:25:15,311
I want my corners.

379
00:25:21,368 --> 00:25:22,060
Fuck.

380
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:25,074
What now?

381
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:26,153
Problems, Mr. Bell.

382
00:25:26,177 --> 00:25:28,054
Naw, this ain't
the time for problems, man.

383
00:25:28,077 --> 00:25:28,887
I got places to be.

384
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,717
We're being told it
may take weeks before

385
00:25:30,728 --> 00:25:32,474
we can get the city
inspectors back down

386
00:25:32,485 --> 00:25:33,518
here to approve these site changes.

387
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:34,023
Weeks?

388
00:25:34,164 --> 00:25:35,783
Every day we wait, you lose money.

389
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:36,644
What the fuck?

390
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,779
How does anybody make
any money in this game?

391
00:25:38,815 --> 00:25:41,172
Every time I think we good,
y'all back in my pockets.

392
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:49,075
You need to make a call.

393
00:25:49,485 --> 00:25:49,990
Again?

394
00:25:50,952 --> 00:25:52,324
He's the consultant, right?

395
00:25:52,406 --> 00:25:55,292
You're paying him a nice chunk
of change to consult, right?

396
00:25:56,136 --> 00:25:58,162
This is why we have
a politically connected guy

397
00:25:58,185 --> 00:25:59,218
like that on the payroll.

398
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:02,479
He goes downtown and does for us
what we can't do for ourselves.

399
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:05,998
Democracy in action, Mr. Bell.

400
00:26:11,356 --> 00:26:12,212
A- ight, look.

401
00:26:12,588 --> 00:26:14,647
Me and Slim, we gonna
work through the alleys

402
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,849
and hit 'em from this side.

403
00:26:16,602 --> 00:26:19,206
I want you, to come through here.

404
00:26:20,597 --> 00:26:21,582
Slow down.

405
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:23,072
Through the intersection.

406
00:26:23,142 --> 00:26:25,805
Hold, why don't
we just come up this way

407
00:26:25,828 --> 00:26:28,468
then we don't have to worry
'bout crossin' no intersection.

408
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,828
Come that way.

409
00:26:30,461 --> 00:26:32,795
You puttin' your driver
in the line of fire, man.

410
00:26:33,382 --> 00:26:34,168
Think on it.

411
00:26:34,602 --> 00:26:35,927
He gettin' taken out.

412
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,710
Car gonna crash.

413
00:26:38,226 --> 00:26:39,388
Now, where that put you at?

414
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:42,375
Besides you don't wanna be shooting
cross your driver, do you?

415
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:45,308
A- ight, so come in easy.

416
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:49,202
They ain't gonna be lookin' for you
'cause we gonna have their full attention.

417
00:26:49,237 --> 00:26:52,526
Hey, look, pick your targets,
drop 'em and move out quick.

418
00:26:52,796 --> 00:26:53,500
Who drivin'?

419
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:54,556
I'm under the wheel.

420
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:56,268
Alright, you make sure
you slow down

421
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,262
at the end of the block
and toss your weapons.

422
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:01,780
And get rid of any shell casings
that kick back in the car.

423
00:27:02,026 --> 00:27:03,469
Poh-leece can trace them shits.

424
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:04,830
Toss the gloves too, right?

425
00:27:04,982 --> 00:27:06,214
Naw, hold on to them.

426
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,701
They gonna have
that D.N.A. Shit all on 'em.

427
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:11,655
Alright, look, it's gonna
take us some time to get set up

428
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:14,869
soe need ya'll to lay back
'bout four, five blocks.

429
00:27:15,162 --> 00:27:17,625
And when we ready, we're
gonna hit you on the burner.

430
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,487
Which y'all hold t'til I call you.
You got it?

431
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,294
We gonna handle our end.

432
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:25,218
You just make sure some fuckin'
way left out there for us.

433
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,327
'Cause I don't wanna feel
like I'm just someamn decoy.

434
00:27:28,491 --> 00:27:29,605
Damn right about that.

435
00:27:32,081 --> 00:27:34,306
It's just a relocate, no big deal.

436
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:36,629
I'm not asking for
round-the-clock protection

437
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,544
or anything like that.

438
00:27:37,579 --> 00:27:38,294
No big deal?

439
00:27:38,986 --> 00:27:40,230
Come on, Bunny, where the fuck

440
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,142
am I gonna find a house
for this old broad?

441
00:27:42,165 --> 00:27:43,127
I got one already.

442
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,279
It's a foreclosure
up off the harford road.

443
00:27:45,314 --> 00:27:47,355
All you gotta do is file
the emergency petition

444
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:48,692
my boys will move her in.

445
00:27:51,226 --> 00:27:53,373
She's witnessing against
a violent drug crew.

446
00:27:54,053 --> 00:27:56,397
Without her cooperation,
I doubt if it'll go forward.

447
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,605
She's 73 years old.

448
00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:01,394
She's a brave old broad
to be doing this, I guess.

449
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:02,262
C'mon, Ray.

450
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:04,983
Look, we just lost
a witness in a drug case.

451
00:28:05,054 --> 00:28:06,986
We don't wanna
lose another one so quick.

452
00:28:11,596 --> 00:28:14,001
If Rawls gets wind of this,
you forged my signature.

453
00:28:16,392 --> 00:28:17,717
Where's she living now, anyway?

454
00:28:17,741 --> 00:28:19,512
She's on Vincent Street, sector two.

455
00:28:20,087 --> 00:28:21,084
Bad location, huh?

456
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:22,973
You wouldn't believe it.

457
00:28:29,981 --> 00:28:31,366
We should wait for the call.

458
00:28:31,706 --> 00:28:33,313
Man, what if that
crew got lookouts?

459
00:28:33,348 --> 00:28:36,058
Motherfucker, if we wait, it'll
be all over time we get there.

460
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:37,814
Plus, look I'm sayin'

461
00:28:38,189 --> 00:28:39,726
how's that gonna play with Avon

462
00:28:40,465 --> 00:28:41,696
they takin' all the credit.

463
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,625
Yo, fellas, strap up.

464
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:10,620
There go that
motherfucker Nay-Nay, man.

465
00:29:11,241 --> 00:29:12,109
I say we take him.

466
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:13,481
We should wait for the call.

467
00:29:13,482 --> 00:29:15,159
Man, we wait,
he gonna get away, man.

468
00:29:19,983 --> 00:29:20,745
Go, go, go.

469
00:29:29,163 --> 00:29:30,195
Get out, get out!

470
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,367
What the fuck.

471
00:29:56,518 --> 00:29:59,415
Didn't I say something about waiting
for a fucking phone call.

472
00:30:13,972 --> 00:30:15,063
You know how you blow-off

473
00:30:15,087 --> 00:30:17,068
half the invitations
you get to be somewhere?

474
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:19,801
Ribbon cuttings,
playground clean-ups and shit?

475
00:30:20,071 --> 00:30:21,068
I got to, no choice.

476
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,167
I was gonna cut out
on one the other day,

477
00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:25,326
it was a fundraiser
for the delta phis, you know?

478
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:27,548
But I drag-ass over to the forum
to show the flag

479
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,742
and who's there in his ironsides
but Odell Watkins.

480
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,724
The rainmaker himself.

481
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:33,431
Yeah, talking in public about

482
00:30:33,443 --> 00:30:35,384
being kinda disappointed
in the Mayor.

483
00:30:37,407 --> 00:30:39,190
Disappointed, yeah?

484
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:40,702
Like how?

485
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:43,036
Like sincerely disappointed...

486
00:30:43,611 --> 00:30:45,452
the way you'd be
with one of your kids.

487
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,552
Like he really wanted to see
the Mayor pressed, you know?

488
00:30:48,354 --> 00:30:49,316
Got me thinking.

489
00:30:49,762 --> 00:30:52,401
Maybe somebody can take a run
at Royce in next year's primary.

490
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,073
Like who?

491
00:30:53,507 --> 00:30:54,703
Madame Council President?

492
00:30:56,181 --> 00:30:57,917
Or Mickey Pepper
would give him a fight.

493
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:00,510
Mick's already said he doesn't
want to leave the legislature.

494
00:31:00,522 --> 00:31:01,272
He won't risk it.

495
00:31:01,871 --> 00:31:04,210
Well, you gotta
have someone with balls.

496
00:31:04,456 --> 00:31:05,570
And somebody black.

497
00:31:07,248 --> 00:31:08,831
This being Baltimore and all.

498
00:31:15,844 --> 00:31:16,818
How many y'all take?

499
00:31:17,404 --> 00:31:17,850
Two.

500
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:20,900
Didn't get nary a shot off.

501
00:31:22,671 --> 00:31:24,736
Speak to the quality
of Barksdale's people.

502
00:31:24,977 --> 00:31:26,326
He gonna have to come back at you.

503
00:31:27,382 --> 00:31:28,918
You know it ain't gonna stop at this.

504
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:30,103
I don't want it to stop.

505
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:32,250
Barksdale weak today.

506
00:31:35,088 --> 00:31:37,124
They ain't working
with the ammunition I got.

507
00:31:37,898 --> 00:31:39,611
No doubt, you carryin'
a full clip.

508
00:31:40,256 --> 00:31:43,107
But what you gonna do when you sittin'
at the head of the table?

509
00:31:43,142 --> 00:31:45,875
Once you there,
you got to hold it down.

510
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:49,857
Sound like one
of them good problems.

511
00:31:52,027 --> 00:31:56,110
Prisons and graveyards
full of boys who wore the crown.

512
00:31:56,626 --> 00:31:57,808
Point is, they wore it.

513
00:31:58,429 --> 00:31:59,907
It's my turn to wear it now.

514
00:32:03,016 --> 00:32:04,295
We're gonna do this, right, Chris?

515
00:32:04,729 --> 00:32:07,180
- We gonna do this, son.
- It's ready yesterday, dawg.

516
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:10,403
White t's, man?

517
00:32:11,189 --> 00:32:12,702
Need to get yourself some white t's.

518
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,180
So you workin'
your plan, huh, Bubs?

519
00:32:18,649 --> 00:32:20,086
Dollar here, dollar there, Kima.

520
00:32:21,505 --> 00:32:22,784
So, what's up? Why you call?

521
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,602
Jus' checkin' in.

522
00:32:24,977 --> 00:32:27,077
You still interested
in the boy Marlo, right?

523
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:29,036
No?

524
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:31,213
You wanna keep gettin' paid

525
00:32:31,225 --> 00:32:33,119
you need to get your ass
up to park heights

526
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,840
school yourself on a jamaican
named Kintel got them corners.

527
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:37,547
Kintel, huh?

528
00:32:38,591 --> 00:32:40,491
My bosses don't
give a fuck about Marlo.

529
00:32:40,597 --> 00:32:41,958
Stringer's people neither.

530
00:32:42,884 --> 00:32:43,623
That's too bad.

531
00:32:44,187 --> 00:32:44,738
Yeah.

532
00:32:45,324 --> 00:32:47,023
'Cause now we got
a whole lot of drama.

533
00:32:47,046 --> 00:32:47,703
What happened?

534
00:32:48,137 --> 00:32:50,284
That young buck, Marlo,
ain't gettin' runned off.

535
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:52,595
He jus' dropped two Barksdale
soldiers on the corner

536
00:32:52,618 --> 00:32:54,296
of Mount and Fayette
a few hours past.

537
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:54,636
What?

538
00:32:55,551 --> 00:32:57,029
Corners all jumpin' bad.

539
00:32:57,451 --> 00:32:59,435
I thought Marlo
had them corners for Stringer.

540
00:32:59,447 --> 00:33:01,499
- We saw them meet.
- I don't know what you saw

541
00:33:01,511 --> 00:33:03,634
all I know is Marlo
is flying his own colors.

542
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,062
Westside about
to be all Baghdad an' shit.

543
00:33:07,856 --> 00:33:09,812
But ya'll looking
for jake, what's his name?

544
00:33:09,836 --> 00:33:10,235
Kintel?

545
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:12,053
Y'all too fickle for Bubs, man.

546
00:33:12,088 --> 00:33:12,675
I swear.

547
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,592
A little gift for you and your boys.

548
00:33:17,026 --> 00:33:17,597
Call me.

549
00:33:19,533 --> 00:33:21,093
Whitey sale! Whitey sale!

550
00:33:22,993 --> 00:33:25,715
Deputy, I am aware of the
incident and my men are on it.

551
00:33:26,313 --> 00:33:28,667
We called in the seven-to-three
flex squad early

552
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:29,934
and my D.E.U. is canvassing.

553
00:33:30,544 --> 00:33:31,635
<i>And what do we know?</i>

554
00:33:32,738 --> 00:33:34,884
Only that it seems to be rival gangs.

555
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,515
What does homicide have?

556
00:33:36,544 --> 00:33:37,829
<i>Fuck homicide. </i>

557
00:33:37,998 --> 00:33:40,016
<i>I'm asking you
for answers right now, Major. </i>

558
00:33:40,063 --> 00:33:41,048
Sir, my men..

559
00:33:41,071 --> 00:33:42,620
<i>And you damn sure have none. </i>

560
00:33:42,631 --> 00:33:43,922
My men are out there...

561
00:33:49,717 --> 00:33:51,899
What do we know that we
can actually tell the man?

562
00:33:51,934 --> 00:33:53,354
Like you said, rival gangs.

563
00:33:53,377 --> 00:33:54,421
Which gangs?

564
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:55,770
Gangs.

565
00:33:56,099 --> 00:33:57,741
Assholes who don't like each other.

566
00:34:03,635 --> 00:34:05,758
I'm sorry, Major.
But we got nothin' on it.

567
00:34:17,587 --> 00:34:20,050
Play it. It don't make me
no never mind.

568
00:34:20,177 --> 00:34:21,244
It's all 'bout trumps.

569
00:34:27,262 --> 00:34:28,177
Evenin', omar.

570
00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:31,679
Evenin', Bruiser.

571
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:39,139
Speakin' 'of them trumps now.

572
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:47,837
Hey, everybody.

573
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:52,599
What's for dinner, Jen?
I'm starvin'.

574
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:54,171
It's working.

575
00:34:59,739 --> 00:35:00,630
Hi, daddy.

576
00:35:01,651 --> 00:35:02,941
How you doin', beautiful?

577
00:35:03,011 --> 00:35:04,302
Daddy, we shared with you.

578
00:35:05,967 --> 00:35:06,718
That's nice.

579
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,988
Hey, Jen, you seen that tape
I was watchin' last night?

580
00:35:09,999 --> 00:35:11,689
I don't know
what you're talking about.

581
00:35:11,712 --> 00:35:12,603
You gotta see this.

582
00:35:13,096 --> 00:35:15,360
Videotape from last monday
night's council meeting.

583
00:35:15,395 --> 00:35:18,394
Keiffer tried to block my resolution
but I laid him out good.

584
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,506
I was in rare form, baby.

585
00:35:21,045 --> 00:35:23,814
- You seen that tape?
- Maybe you left it in the VCR.

586
00:35:26,766 --> 00:35:28,971
What... sonofabitch.

587
00:35:31,658 --> 00:35:32,548
Who the hell...

588
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:34,743
Daddy, Franky shared
his sammitch with you.

589
00:35:35,247 --> 00:35:38,649
We hid it so no one else could
eat it before you came home.

590
00:35:47,435 --> 00:35:49,711
Could I get some chips
and pickles with that too?

591
00:35:53,722 --> 00:35:55,224
I don't want to disrespect you.

592
00:35:57,605 --> 00:35:59,165
String been good to me, you know?

593
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:01,347
Not just my bills.

594
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,948
Him and Avon probably
think they owe me that much.

595
00:36:05,426 --> 00:36:08,089
And it ain't what people might
be thinking or saying, either.

596
00:36:08,206 --> 00:36:09,379
What they saying, honey?

597
00:36:09,989 --> 00:36:11,748
It ain't like I don't miss Dee.

598
00:36:13,063 --> 00:36:13,861
I do.

599
00:36:15,292 --> 00:36:18,072
Yeah, well, I miss him too

600
00:36:18,799 --> 00:36:20,395
but he's been gone a while now.

601
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:21,919
More than a year.

602
00:36:24,758 --> 00:36:25,814
Stringer's fine

603
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:28,301
no denying that.

604
00:36:31,245 --> 00:36:32,559
I feel safe around him.

605
00:36:35,714 --> 00:36:37,345
You asking to get with String

606
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:40,301
I'm okay with that.

607
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,409
Thought you was gonna be mad.

608
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:50,342
I mean, everything with Dee
is so messed up, you know?

609
00:36:50,905 --> 00:36:52,735
I mean, every time
I think about it...

610
00:36:54,201 --> 00:36:55,761
and you know this one police

611
00:36:56,266 --> 00:36:58,541
he came by here
and brought it all up again.

612
00:36:59,609 --> 00:37:00,101
Who did?

613
00:37:00,746 --> 00:37:02,248
Police detective from the city.

614
00:37:03,081 --> 00:37:06,025
The one tried to turn Dee on Avon
when he got pulled up in Jersey.

615
00:37:07,444 --> 00:37:08,066
White boy?

616
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:10,154
- Bushy hair?
- Yeah.

617
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,547
What he say?

618
00:37:15,104 --> 00:37:16,113
What he say?

619
00:37:17,591 --> 00:37:22,318
He said maybe D'Angelo didn't take

620
00:37:23,632 --> 00:37:26,201
you know... take his own life.

621
00:37:27,925 --> 00:37:29,708
He said maybe
it was something else.

622
00:37:31,855 --> 00:37:33,122
And he came to you with it?

623
00:37:34,072 --> 00:37:35,468
Left his card here one day

624
00:37:36,274 --> 00:37:37,916
but I didn't say
nothing to the man.

625
00:37:38,362 --> 00:37:39,582
Just told Stringer is all.

626
00:37:47,722 --> 00:37:49,494
She's gonna run for Council?

627
00:37:50,233 --> 00:37:51,019
She is.

628
00:37:52,274 --> 00:37:53,916
Probably win, too, if I know her.

629
00:37:55,828 --> 00:37:57,283
And you're the proud husband?

630
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:05,983
Not sure how that makes me feel.

631
00:38:07,308 --> 00:38:09,713
It's just for show until
the election next year.

632
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:14,124
A city police lieutenant
looks good on her arm.

633
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:17,044
Who even cares anymore?

634
00:38:17,592 --> 00:38:18,953
Half the country are separated

635
00:38:18,976 --> 00:38:21,428
the other half are getting
divorced for the second time.

636
00:38:21,439 --> 00:38:22,296
This is a favor.

637
00:38:22,964 --> 00:38:23,410
For her.

638
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:26,331
It's hard to explain.

639
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:39,222
Look, I disappointed her.

640
00:38:41,393 --> 00:38:43,234
She lived through me
for a lotta years

641
00:38:44,313 --> 00:38:46,601
telling herself I was tracked
for deputy commissioner

642
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,841
at worst and past the police
department, who knows?

643
00:38:50,472 --> 00:38:52,937
And there we were some things
that happened a long time ago

644
00:38:52,947 --> 00:38:53,876
when I was in Eastern.

645
00:38:56,062 --> 00:38:57,113
I guess she wanted more out of me

646
00:38:58,633 --> 00:39:00,986
and after a lot of years
and a lot of plans

647
00:39:02,101 --> 00:39:04,342
it turns out I have
a better head for police work

648
00:39:04,364 --> 00:39:05,959
than I do for climbing the ladder.

649
00:39:06,312 --> 00:39:08,037
She hung in there
thinking my career

650
00:39:08,048 --> 00:39:10,156
was going to turn
into some kind of big deal

651
00:39:10,496 --> 00:39:12,901
and I probably let her
believe it just to keep peace.

652
00:39:15,212 --> 00:39:16,807
Now she wants
to be the big deal.

653
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:21,464
What do you want?

654
00:39:27,552 --> 00:39:29,605
I just don't want
to disappoint her anymore

655
00:39:30,215 --> 00:39:30,942
and right now

656
00:39:31,725 --> 00:39:33,942
I'm more help showing up
at some chicken dinner

657
00:39:33,977 --> 00:39:35,572
in my wedding ring and dress blues

658
00:39:36,053 --> 00:39:38,141
then being the
not-even-divorced-yet husband

659
00:39:38,165 --> 00:39:39,619
with the white woman on his arm.

660
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,478
I'm going to do what I can to see

661
00:39:51,502 --> 00:39:53,437
she gets what she
wants this time around.

662
00:39:55,502 --> 00:39:56,546
Nothing more than that.

663
00:39:58,082 --> 00:39:59,478
Last seen Gerard, man

664
00:39:59,502 --> 00:40:01,590
he was racin' bullets
up on Fayette Street.

665
00:40:02,012 --> 00:40:03,467
He appeared to be winnin', too.

666
00:40:03,572 --> 00:40:05,363
Look, man,
until he shows back up

667
00:40:05,387 --> 00:40:07,439
we ain't gonna know
what happened out there.

668
00:40:07,756 --> 00:40:09,868
I damn sure know one
fuckin' thing for sure.

669
00:40:10,255 --> 00:40:13,105
Two our people are chalked
and we ain't got shit to show for it.

670
00:40:13,152 --> 00:40:15,225
Man, police gonna
be real heavy on this, man.

671
00:40:15,248 --> 00:40:16,480
I say we slow down.

672
00:40:16,503 --> 00:40:18,415
Take our time
to build our muscle up...

673
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:20,562
No, I ain't got no more
motherfuckin' time, man!

674
00:40:20,632 --> 00:40:22,873
When the word comes that this boy,
Marlo, punkin' me

675
00:40:22,896 --> 00:40:23,929
what am I look like?

676
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:25,946
I'm gonna go do this
shit my damn self.

677
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,823
Naw, man, you just
this minute got home.

678
00:40:27,846 --> 00:40:29,581
Your name come up
in a murder beef, man

679
00:40:29,582 --> 00:40:30,756
they gonna pull your parole.

680
00:40:30,779 --> 00:40:31,823
Let me take care of this.

681
00:40:31,858 --> 00:40:33,899
We was thinkin', man,
me and Cutty, you know

682
00:40:33,923 --> 00:40:35,682
so we could hit
back at 'em ourselves.

683
00:40:35,706 --> 00:40:37,310
That way there
won't be no fuckups.

684
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:39,961
Look, you two
niggers get on it, man.

685
00:40:41,779 --> 00:40:42,694
And get it right.

686
00:40:47,363 --> 00:40:49,486
You see how shit
had to be handled, man.

687
00:40:49,509 --> 00:40:51,222
The game is the fucking game.

688
00:40:51,398 --> 00:40:51,938
Period.

689
00:40:52,501 --> 00:40:53,709
Same as it ever was.

690
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,310
I dunno though, man.
I mean...

691
00:41:03,691 --> 00:41:04,184
I mean...

692
00:41:04,911 --> 00:41:07,421
I dunno, I was just down the way
with one of our younguns

693
00:41:07,433 --> 00:41:09,134
on Vincent Street
where they got them

694
00:41:09,146 --> 00:41:10,788
you know, empty houses over there.

695
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:13,333
And they got crews over there

696
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:16,430
twirlin' dope and coke like
the shit was candy.

697
00:41:18,284 --> 00:41:21,052
Kids with a lemonade stand.
It's a different world down there.

698
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:23,691
Like the cops just standing
around like that shit was...

699
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:25,275
legal.

700
00:41:26,014 --> 00:41:28,583
I mean, every day.

701
00:41:29,967 --> 00:41:30,811
It actually was business.

702
00:41:37,814 --> 00:41:39,410
What you sayin', man.
What's up?

703
00:41:43,891 --> 00:41:44,536
Nothin', man.

704
00:41:46,999 --> 00:41:47,633
Nothin' at all.

705
00:41:51,222 --> 00:41:53,240
Our C.I. tells us those
are Stringer's people.

706
00:41:53,251 --> 00:41:55,304
You want us to be about
the bodies, now we are.

707
00:41:55,691 --> 00:41:57,662
We had this kid, Marlo
working for Stringer

708
00:41:57,674 --> 00:41:58,671
but that might be wrong.

709
00:41:58,718 --> 00:42:00,524
He might be going
to war for those corners.

710
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:12,413
Let me be clear:

711
00:42:13,187 --> 00:42:15,345
This is no longer
about Stringer Bell.

712
00:42:15,615 --> 00:42:17,879
Or Kintel fucking Williamson.
Or any of them.

713
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:21,222
What is my rank, Detective Greggs?

714
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:23,627
My rank!

715
00:42:24,389 --> 00:42:25,199
Lieutenant, sir.

716
00:42:26,313 --> 00:42:28,143
What is my rank,
Detective McNulty?

717
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,755
If you can't
remember that much

718
00:42:34,779 --> 00:42:36,894
then you can go
the hell back to narcotics.

719
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:40,304
And you can go to whatever the
hell unit will still have you.

720
00:42:41,207 --> 00:42:42,955
Now get the fuck out
of my office.

721
00:43:11,917 --> 00:43:13,441
Your message said you'd be here.

722
00:43:15,975 --> 00:43:17,324
Still, I kinda thought it'd be

723
00:43:17,348 --> 00:43:19,436
one of your minions
showed up in the flesh.

724
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,849
You called on some
of my people's people.

725
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:26,040
I'm just workin'.

726
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:30,157
Doin' what a man is supposed to do.

727
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,300
Well, I know you been busy.

728
00:43:33,508 --> 00:43:36,969
Caught some talk from the young men
you rousted over there on the Westside.

729
00:43:39,045 --> 00:43:41,098
That was about a gun,
belonged to a police.

730
00:43:42,658 --> 00:43:44,605
Yeah, caught some
talk about that, too.

731
00:43:47,303 --> 00:43:50,024
This here's about something else.

732
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,291
Girl by the name of Tosha,
got her head blowed off in a firefight.

733
00:43:59,863 --> 00:44:02,432
If you're not here to cooperate,
then why are you here?

734
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:09,223
Okay, I could just pull up
that other girl from your squad.

735
00:44:10,502 --> 00:44:11,863
She ain't gonna talk to you.

736
00:44:12,332 --> 00:44:13,798
Ain't nobody gonna talk to you.

737
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:16,109
I just came here
to make that clear, man.

738
00:44:16,215 --> 00:44:17,047
Ain't no thing.

739
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,992
'Cause I already
got me an eyeball wit.

740
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:21,047
You do?

741
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,534
I dunno 'bout that.

742
00:44:23,816 --> 00:44:26,654
Old Bruiser, he be blind behind
that fortified half the time.

743
00:44:27,613 --> 00:44:30,475
Shit, you gonna have to dry him out
just to get him on the stand.

744
00:44:31,038 --> 00:44:33,584
'Sides, he done had
a change o' heart to that story.

745
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:35,461
That's what I heard, anyway.

746
00:44:36,594 --> 00:44:39,210
An' past that, you gonna have to call
this one of them

747
00:44:40,372 --> 00:44:41,650
cost-of-doin'- business things

748
00:44:41,685 --> 00:44:43,679
you all police be talkin'
about all the time.

749
00:44:43,855 --> 00:44:44,548
Ya feel me?

750
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:46,471
No taxpayers.

751
00:44:46,706 --> 00:44:48,254
Shit, way y'all lookin' at things

752
00:44:48,512 --> 00:44:50,072
ain't no victim to even speak of.

753
00:44:50,295 --> 00:44:51,961
Bullshit, boy. No victim?!

754
00:44:52,078 --> 00:44:54,096
I just came from
Tosha's people, remember?

755
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,961
All this death,
you don't think that ripples out?

756
00:44:56,219 --> 00:44:58,691
You don't even know what
the fuck I'm talkin' about.

757
00:45:02,655 --> 00:45:04,591
I was a few years
ahead of you at Emondson.

758
00:45:04,603 --> 00:45:06,984
But I know you remember
the neighborhood, how it was.

759
00:45:10,163 --> 00:45:11,875
We had some bad boys for real.

760
00:45:14,081 --> 00:45:15,218
Wasn't about guns

761
00:45:16,075 --> 00:45:18,198
so much as knowin'
what to do with your hands.

762
00:45:19,054 --> 00:45:20,649
Those boys could real rack it.

763
00:45:26,949 --> 00:45:27,617
My father...

764
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:31,113
had me on the straight.

765
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,001
But like any young man
I wanted to be hard, too.

766
00:45:36,928 --> 00:45:40,048
So I'd turn up at all the house parties
where the tough boys hung.

767
00:45:41,807 --> 00:45:43,555
Shit, they knew
I wasn't one of them.

768
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:49,608
Them hardcases would
come up to me and say:

769
00:45:49,631 --> 00:45:51,801
"go home, schoolboy,
you don't belong here. "

770
00:45:55,391 --> 00:45:57,995
Didn't realize at the time
what they were doin' for me.

771
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,033
As rough as that
neighborhood could be

772
00:46:07,314 --> 00:46:08,909
we had us a community.

773
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:11,630
Nobody, no victim,
who didn't matter.

774
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:17,305
And now all we got is bodies,
and predatory motherfuckers like you.

775
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,868
And out where that girl fell,
I saw kids actin' like Omar

776
00:46:22,888 --> 00:46:25,551
callin' you by name.
Glorifyin' your ass.

777
00:46:26,603 --> 00:46:29,700
Makes me sick, motherfucker,
how far we done fell.

778
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:52,327
25,000.

779
00:46:52,632 --> 00:46:54,673
You don't need more
than that to get it done.

780
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:55,928
The fuck you say?

781
00:46:56,151 --> 00:46:58,974
I'm just tellin' you how they do
down at zoning and permits.

782
00:46:59,561 --> 00:47:01,273
They know you got
a general contractor

783
00:47:01,274 --> 00:47:03,397
and his people out there
sittin' on their ass.

784
00:47:03,432 --> 00:47:05,727
They know you payin'
twice that every week they sit.

785
00:47:05,751 --> 00:47:07,444
25 gets me the permits?

786
00:47:08,636 --> 00:47:10,255
20 gets you the permits.

787
00:47:10,959 --> 00:47:14,079
Five is for me for bribin'
these downtown motherfuckers.

788
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,903
I mean, I'm the one
got to risk walkin' up

789
00:47:16,926 --> 00:47:19,777
to these thievin' bitches
with cash in hand, right?

790
00:47:20,551 --> 00:47:21,654
I'm telling you, String.

791
00:47:22,545 --> 00:47:24,352
The people running
the city nowadays?

792
00:47:24,574 --> 00:47:26,529
They make the last
bunch look sanctified.

793
00:47:27,233 --> 00:47:29,227
I mean, this some shameful shit.

794
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:41,462
Permits come when?

795
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:42,870
Monday.

796
00:47:43,656 --> 00:47:44,219
Latest.

797
00:47:55,738 --> 00:47:56,664
<i>Spider bags!</i>

798
00:47:57,626 --> 00:47:58,506
<i>Spider bags!</i>

799
00:47:59,034 --> 00:48:00,644
Cutt, that's him.

800
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:02,063
Fruit.

801
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:07,494
Yo, I know that nigger, man.

802
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:09,887
Owe me money, actually.

803
00:48:17,688 --> 00:48:19,388
She ain't say it like that.

804
00:48:19,952 --> 00:48:22,192
She say it like she wanted
to get pregnant an' shit.

805
00:48:23,236 --> 00:48:23,647
A- ight.

806
00:48:51,718 --> 00:48:54,229
Damn, I opened up too early, man.

807
00:48:54,545 --> 00:48:55,625
I stepped on your shot.

808
00:48:56,586 --> 00:48:57,898
Come on, let's book.

809
00:49:01,921 --> 00:49:04,490
Yo, there go
five-oh right there, yo.

810
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:06,379
Yeah, I know it's nothing.

811
00:49:08,209 --> 00:49:09,898
The cops be lettin'
niggas grind down here.

812
00:49:09,968 --> 00:49:13,370
It all... get the fuck out
of here little hoppers.

813
00:49:13,428 --> 00:49:14,578
Get out of here, son.

814
00:49:14,602 --> 00:49:16,173
Look at these little minis.

815
00:49:16,314 --> 00:49:17,780
Hey, yo, what if he lock us up?

816
00:49:18,918 --> 00:49:20,361
I hope y'all got toothbrushes?

817
00:49:21,847 --> 00:49:24,134
'Cause down in boy's village,
you know what I'm sayin'

818
00:49:24,158 --> 00:49:27,290
if you don't have no toothbrush,
you gonna be usin' some other boy's brush

819
00:49:27,313 --> 00:49:29,225
or rubbin' your teeth
with your damn finger.

820
00:49:29,237 --> 00:49:30,402
If you don't get locked up

821
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:32,541
y'all can keep an extra
20 each off the pack.

822
00:49:38,645 --> 00:49:39,853
...got that fire, baby?

823
00:49:44,029 --> 00:49:46,363
Come on, Tommy, give it up already.

824
00:49:46,668 --> 00:49:49,038
Look, Terri,
you gotta do this for me.

825
00:49:49,515 --> 00:49:51,052
Tell me why
you wanna be mayor.

826
00:49:51,204 --> 00:49:53,128
Why should I vote
for you over Royce?

827
00:49:53,222 --> 00:49:56,189
'Cause something is wrong in that city
and I think I can fix it.

828
00:49:56,412 --> 00:49:59,544
This guy, he don't give a shit
about tackling the problems.

829
00:49:59,787 --> 00:50:01,804
Crime is outta fucking control.

830
00:50:02,086 --> 00:50:04,925
Last week, a kid witness
in a drug case turns up

831
00:50:04,948 --> 00:50:06,813
shot dead because
of flaws in the system.

832
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,526
I go to the Mayor
who promises action.

833
00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:11,892
And then, "mister reform-is-more-than-
- the-watchword-of-my-administration"

834
00:50:11,904 --> 00:50:14,309
pats me on the ass,
thanks me for my concern

835
00:50:14,473 --> 00:50:15,974
points me out the door. The end.

836
00:50:16,303 --> 00:50:18,738
So, with crime as the issue

837
00:50:18,739 --> 00:50:21,089
the great white father
rides to the rescue.

838
00:50:21,684 --> 00:50:25,261
Against a black incumbent mayor,
in a city that's 65% black?

839
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,217
Black, white, green...
people are pissed off.

840
00:50:28,367 --> 00:50:30,208
What makes you
think this is doable?

841
00:50:30,384 --> 00:50:34,138
One, I hear the mayor's got problems
in his base and with key supporters.

842
00:50:34,408 --> 00:50:36,578
Two, I got
the Police Commissioner

843
00:50:36,637 --> 00:50:38,757
Royce's own man,
telling me all kinds of stuff

844
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,795
about his fucked-up department
and about Royce's inner circle.

845
00:50:41,889 --> 00:50:44,317
And three, Tony Gray,
from the Fifth District

846
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,501
comes pretty close
to telling me he's thinking

847
00:50:46,513 --> 00:50:47,439
about a run for mayor.

848
00:50:47,697 --> 00:50:48,964
That'd split the black vote.

849
00:50:50,454 --> 00:50:51,566
You'd still need a player

850
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:53,428
who gives the black
middle-class permission

851
00:50:53,463 --> 00:50:54,836
to vote against one of their own.

852
00:50:55,211 --> 00:50:56,888
You got one of those
in your pocket?

853
00:50:56,982 --> 00:50:58,249
Not many of those around.

854
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:00,572
Elijah?

855
00:51:01,592 --> 00:51:04,407
Congressional black caucus
ain't gonna save your skinny white ass.

856
00:51:04,466 --> 00:51:07,176
What about Odell Watkins?

857
00:51:07,328 --> 00:51:09,017
Well, it's funny you
should mention him

858
00:51:09,029 --> 00:51:11,668
cuz I don't think he's too
happy with the Mayor right now.

859
00:51:12,196 --> 00:51:12,677
I dunno.

860
00:51:12,701 --> 00:51:15,481
I hear a new poll shows Royce's
negatives are pretty high.

861
00:51:15,551 --> 00:51:17,229
You'd have to raise
a load of dough.

862
00:51:26,038 --> 00:51:27,868
He has to see it.
I know he sees it.

863
00:51:30,061 --> 00:51:31,305
It's past that now.

864
00:51:31,387 --> 00:51:32,982
It's about us showing some respect.

865
00:51:32,994 --> 00:51:34,155
Oh, fuck respect.

866
00:51:35,446 --> 00:51:37,217
- He ain't right.
- No, he ain't.

867
00:51:37,706 --> 00:51:38,492
But at this point

868
00:51:38,516 --> 00:51:40,440
with you on the other
side of the argument

869
00:51:40,475 --> 00:51:41,448
he'd rather be wrong.

870
00:51:42,164 --> 00:51:44,170
Maybe if the word
came down from on high

871
00:51:45,378 --> 00:51:46,915
it might change his mind.

872
00:51:50,454 --> 00:51:54,606
I mean, if your friend Bunny Colvin's
up to his ass in bodies

873
00:51:55,357 --> 00:51:57,277
then he'd take all
the help he can get.

874
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,280
Not that you'd ever
go behind anybody's back

875
00:52:04,304 --> 00:52:07,154
or anything like that, right?

876
00:52:11,057 --> 00:52:11,667
No way.

877
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:14,647
Two more murders yesterday

878
00:52:15,479 --> 00:52:17,438
and another three today...

879
00:52:18,248 --> 00:52:19,479
including a 14-year-old.

880
00:52:20,183 --> 00:52:21,497
We're doing all we can.

881
00:52:22,048 --> 00:52:25,978
You're at 260 for the year
and it's barely october.

882
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:28,605
You promised me 275 or under, Erv.

883
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:30,021
I had that as a promise.

884
00:52:30,045 --> 00:52:30,479
Sir...

885
00:52:30,526 --> 00:52:32,919
we see 300 before the new year

886
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:35,933
and I'm not sure that I can
justify a full term for you.

887
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:38,666
Now I hate to say it,
but there it is.

888
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:46,217
Barksdale's people and who?

889
00:52:47,223 --> 00:52:51,985
Marlo Stanfield, the new kid,
we've been on him a couple weeks.

890
00:52:53,053 --> 00:52:55,105
But Daniels' people
are up in the Northwest.

891
00:52:56,349 --> 00:52:58,190
Your war's only
gonna get worse, Major.

892
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:02,457
The Northwest has been
quiet for weeks.

893
00:53:06,023 --> 00:53:08,560
You willing to back door your
lieutenant like this, huh?

894
00:53:10,894 --> 00:53:12,079
You ain't changed, Jimmy.

895
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:15,164
Shit.

896
00:53:16,677 --> 00:53:17,909
It's always about your case.

897
00:53:20,173 --> 00:53:21,100
You do what you can.

898
00:53:27,622 --> 00:53:28,877
Keep my name out of it.

899
00:53:45,944 --> 00:53:46,531
How it go?

900
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:49,792
We got one of the two
of the motherfuckers you know.

901
00:53:49,909 --> 00:53:51,082
You mean, you motherfuckers

902
00:53:51,106 --> 00:53:53,323
come strollin' in here
all walkin' tall and shit...

903
00:53:53,334 --> 00:53:55,960
Yo, B, I, man, I'm sayin', man.
We were blazin' on them dudes.

904
00:53:55,972 --> 00:53:58,529
Man, you know what I'm sayin',
just got in the heat, man.

905
00:53:58,552 --> 00:54:00,195
We were blazin' though.
It was like...

906
00:54:00,218 --> 00:54:02,693
Alright relax, man, I already heard.
Go sit down.

907
00:54:03,123 --> 00:54:04,742
I'm not tweakin'
behind none of this.

908
00:54:04,777 --> 00:54:07,475
That's one less motherfucker
that's breathin' than was yesterday

909
00:54:07,487 --> 00:54:09,329
you know what I'm sayin',
so we all good.

910
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:10,936
But I'm surprised at you,
though, man.

911
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:12,472
Shit didn't get by you back when.

912
00:54:13,131 --> 00:54:14,562
Wadn't my man's fault, man.

913
00:54:14,726 --> 00:54:16,920
I unloaded on
the youngun too soon, man.

914
00:54:17,494 --> 00:54:19,512
Gave him enough room
to buck and run, man.

915
00:54:19,641 --> 00:54:21,635
I fucked that shit up
myself, you know...

916
00:54:21,741 --> 00:54:22,386
Hold on.

917
00:54:26,386 --> 00:54:27,418
It's on me.

918
00:54:28,744 --> 00:54:30,421
I had that kid in my sights

919
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:34,562
close enough to take off his Kangol
and half his dome with it.

920
00:54:36,403 --> 00:54:37,729
I couldn't squeeze the trigger.

921
00:54:40,392 --> 00:54:41,283
Couldn't do it, man.

922
00:54:44,603 --> 00:54:45,166
Why not?

923
00:54:48,967 --> 00:54:50,057
Wadn't in me, I guess.

924
00:54:52,849 --> 00:54:55,512
You know, whatever it is in you

925
00:54:57,025 --> 00:54:58,597
that lets you flow like you flowin'

926
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,412
do that thing

927
00:55:02,691 --> 00:55:03,817
it ain't in me no more.

928
00:55:12,345 --> 00:55:12,720
A- ight.

929
00:55:13,905 --> 00:55:15,887
So you done soldierin'
but you ain't done.

930
00:55:16,626 --> 00:55:18,620
I could use you
for what you got in your head.

931
00:55:18,644 --> 00:55:20,928
We're gonna put you on a corner,
you can be inside...

932
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:21,561
Aw, man.

933
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,614
I'm ain't makin' myself clear.

934
00:55:24,588 --> 00:55:26,183
The game ain't in me no more.

935
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:27,532
None of it.

936
00:55:39,943 --> 00:55:41,268
But you ain't done shit else.

937
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:44,400
You know what I'm sayin',
so what you gonna do?

938
00:55:44,423 --> 00:55:45,022
I don't know.

939
00:55:46,511 --> 00:55:47,532
But it can't be this.

940
00:55:52,177 --> 00:55:52,728
A- ight then.

941
00:55:53,573 --> 00:55:54,277
We straight.

942
00:56:00,916 --> 00:56:01,350
See ya.

943
00:56:02,077 --> 00:56:02,558
See ya.

944
00:56:13,139 --> 00:56:15,391
B, he was a man
in his time, you know?

945
00:56:18,734 --> 00:56:19,778
He a man today.

946
00:56:22,723 --> 00:56:23,333
He a man.

947
00:56:34,441 --> 00:56:35,825
Any idea what this is about?

948
00:56:41,325 --> 00:56:41,935
Lieutenant.

949
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,583
Here he is, Bunny.

950
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,850
Cedric Daniels to the rescue.

951
00:57:06,161 --> 00:57:07,432
Man of the hour.
