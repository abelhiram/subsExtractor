1
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:40,666
...and not only do we hear
and appreciate your input

2
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:44,577
but we are fully committed
to giving 110% in our efforts

3
00:01:44,627 --> 00:01:48,356
to fight this war against drugs
and take back your streets.

4
00:01:48,505 --> 00:01:49,970
But we can't do it alone.

5
00:01:50,137 --> 00:01:51,801
So when you see illegal activity

6
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:54,664
we need you to pick up the phone
and call it in so that...

7
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,795
Man, that's bullshit.

8
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,736
Please hold all your questions...

9
00:01:57,753 --> 00:02:00,899
I near wore out my phone
dialin' 6-8-5-drug

10
00:02:00,982 --> 00:02:02,014
and for what?

11
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:04,843
Those boys were back on the
corner the next damn day.

12
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,545
The fact remains the police
department can't do it alone.

13
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,110
We need your cooperation.

14
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:12,423
My cousin Willy Gant cooperated.

15
00:02:12,456 --> 00:02:14,454
He went downtown and testified.

16
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:16,284
He deader than Tupac today.

17
00:02:16,582 --> 00:02:19,810
Look, I know the problem
seems insurmountable.

18
00:02:19,894 --> 00:02:21,441
But we are making progress.

19
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:24,620
Take a look at this chart.
This line here represents...

20
00:02:26,734 --> 00:02:28,100
I have the microphone, ma'am.

21
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:29,398
Let the woman speak.

22
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,308
My kids, they can't
play outside no more.

23
00:02:33,508 --> 00:02:35,688
Some nights,
when we hear these pops

24
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:38,967
we got to sleep under our beds.

25
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,280
I come home from work

26
00:02:41,647 --> 00:02:44,193
I can't even get up my front steps

27
00:02:44,243 --> 00:02:46,788
'cause they occupied
by the drug dealers.

28
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:50,516
Is that in that picture
you got up there?

29
00:02:55,948 --> 00:02:57,013
I'm Major Colvin.

30
00:02:58,577 --> 00:03:01,157
I apologize for giving you
the wrong impression tonight.

31
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,788
We mean no disr'espect.

32
00:03:03,254 --> 00:03:05,285
I know what's going on
in your neighborhoods.

33
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,400
I see it every day.

34
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:10,050
Ma'am, it pains me that you
cannot enter your own front door

35
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,348
in safety

36
00:03:11,631 --> 00:03:13,079
and with dignity.

37
00:03:13,578 --> 00:03:17,839
The truth is, I can't promise
you it's gonna get any better.

38
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:20,669
We can't lock up the thousands
out there on the corners.

39
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:22,999
There'd be no place
to put them even if we could.

40
00:03:23,065 --> 00:03:27,426
We show you charts and statistics
like they mean something.

41
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:31,216
But you going back
to your homes tonight

42
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:33,981
we gonna be in our patrol cars

43
00:03:34,564 --> 00:03:37,560
and them boys still gonna
be out there on the corners

44
00:03:37,626 --> 00:03:38,858
deep in the game.

45
00:03:41,235 --> 00:03:43,199
This is the world we've got, people

46
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:47,743
and it's about time
all of us had the good sense

47
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:49,938
to at least admit that much.

48
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:52,368
So, what's the answer?

49
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:56,578
I'm not sure.

50
00:03:58,459 --> 00:03:59,841
But whatever it is

51
00:04:00,944 --> 00:04:02,376
it can't be a lie.

52
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,247
It's all yours, Sergeant.

53
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,297
As I was pointing out...

54
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,480
Who gave him a can of gasoline
and told him to put out the fire?

55
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:16,261
<i>... Are making progress. </i>

56
00:04:16,277 --> 00:04:17,359
Tommy Carcetti.

57
00:04:18,807 --> 00:04:19,672
Marla Daniels.

58
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:20,588
I'm gonna...

59
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:22,702
gonna take a run
at Eunetta Perkins.

60
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:23,881
I know who you are.

61
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:27,027
I've seen you with Delegate
Watkins a couple times already.

62
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,424
Well, Councilman, this is
not your home district.

63
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:32,271
What brings you
to the Westside?

64
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,734
I got the public safety
subcommittee, so...

65
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,249
here I am.

66
00:04:36,981 --> 00:04:38,446
Anyway, good luck with Eunetta.

67
00:04:38,513 --> 00:04:41,840
And welcome, Ms. Daniels,
to the noble calling of public service.

68
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,087
<i>... further west
in your neighborhoods. </i>

69
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,065
<i>The numbers of crimes against
merchants are way, way down. </i>

70
00:04:48,906 --> 00:04:51,635
<i>We believe we're
making significant... </i>

71
00:04:52,118 --> 00:04:53,166
What the hell was that?

72
00:04:53,183 --> 00:04:54,781
Tired of the bullshit.

73
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,512
Tired make you lose your mind?

74
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:29,757
Amsterdam

75
00:06:51,897 --> 00:06:54,231
So what you need from Bubs,
I mean exactly?

76
00:06:54,407 --> 00:06:55,416
Lay of the land.

77
00:06:55,756 --> 00:06:58,067
Who has what corners,
now that the towers are down.

78
00:06:58,102 --> 00:07:01,037
We wanna know what happened to
the Barksdale people especially.

79
00:07:01,095 --> 00:07:02,409
And this pay how much?

80
00:07:02,526 --> 00:07:04,051
Let's treat it like a real job?

81
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,089
Say five an hour, 30 on a day max.

82
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:09,142
That's less than minimum wage.

83
00:07:09,224 --> 00:07:10,781
That's no withholding, Bubs.

84
00:07:11,004 --> 00:07:11,837
It's tax-free.

85
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,758
Alright. It feels good to be
out here, you know?

86
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:15,896
Gainfully employed.

87
00:07:16,471 --> 00:07:18,664
- Thought your boy was coming, too.
- Johnny?

88
00:07:20,397 --> 00:07:22,614
He don't think much of
this here with y'all.

89
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,770
'Sides, he happen to be one
of the laziest white boys

90
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:27,517
to ever shit between two shoes.

91
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,603
- Me, I been workin' since I was a kid.
- Yeah?

92
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:32,483
What's your resume
read like, Bubs?

93
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,503
Just curious.

94
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,447
Well, I ain't claimin'
no payroll jobs, Kima.

95
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,829
It's been a while since
I punched a clock.

96
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:40,119
When was that?

97
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,343
Long time ago

98
00:07:43,023 --> 00:07:44,560
before I had a sheet.

99
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:45,944
Shoot, I was...

100
00:07:46,296 --> 00:07:47,622
I was still clean.

101
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:49,991
I got one of those
stock boy jobs

102
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:52,619
for one of those
"cheapest guy in town" stores.

103
00:07:53,053 --> 00:07:54,801
Unloading appliances

104
00:07:55,927 --> 00:08:00,533
taking air conditioners and shit
out to the customers' cars like that.

105
00:08:01,308 --> 00:08:02,586
How many you want?

106
00:08:03,912 --> 00:08:05,050
What happened?

107
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:07,714
I put a clock radio
in the trash can one day

108
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,485
tryin' to be cute,
and got caught.

109
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,972
I ain't even need a clock radio.

110
00:08:12,254 --> 00:08:13,157
See, that's me.

111
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,151
Born fuck up.

112
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:19,021
A- ight, you know what?

113
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,438
Five dollars an' hour.

114
00:08:21,977 --> 00:08:24,347
30 on the day. That'll work.

115
00:09:01,813 --> 00:09:05,484
And this here is your
get-out-of-jail-free-card.

116
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:09,004
On this card is my
full name and phone number.

117
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:13,304
A police officer was
shot in this neighborhood

118
00:09:13,328 --> 00:09:14,430
a couple of weeks ago.

119
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:18,829
Y'all know the incident
I'm speaking of, right?

120
00:09:20,202 --> 00:09:22,153
I'm lookin' for the officer's gun

121
00:09:23,537 --> 00:09:24,534
a glock nine

122
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,364
which happened to misplace
itself during this incident.

123
00:09:32,216 --> 00:09:34,140
Now, I don't care...

124
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,144
I don't care who has it now

125
00:09:45,746 --> 00:09:47,939
I just need it
to find its way home.

126
00:09:53,798 --> 00:09:57,200
Y'all don't happen to know a fella
by the name of Peanut, right?

127
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:00,070
I didn't think so.

128
00:10:00,105 --> 00:10:03,167
Anyway, gentleman,
you know, one hand washes the other.

129
00:10:03,225 --> 00:10:05,020
You give me a good word
on that gun

130
00:10:05,055 --> 00:10:07,319
and I can make almost
any charge disappear...

131
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:10,283
Any questions?

132
00:10:12,747 --> 00:10:13,427
Get 'em out.

133
00:10:17,955 --> 00:10:19,550
Shit, I had to try somethin'.

134
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,332
<i>One each. Keep it movin'.</i>

135
00:10:38,356 --> 00:10:40,983
<i>Little boys, yellow tops all day long.
Right here. </i>

136
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,605
Alright, alright.

137
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:45,116
You see him to get that
knock out shit, a-ight.

138
00:10:46,148 --> 00:10:46,875
Good luck to ya.

139
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:49,526
Yo, he down across Freemont?

140
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,684
Yeah, that way on this side.

141
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,432
Oh and Barksdale is down the way.

142
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:55,286
<i>Got the red tops, red tops!</i>

143
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,649
<i>Spider bags. </i>

144
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,632
<i>Come get the red tops,
red tops!</i>

145
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:30,567
<i>Major Crimes Unit. </i>

146
00:11:31,247 --> 00:11:32,632
<i>He's not in right now. </i>

147
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:34,731
<i>Alright. </i>

148
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:36,385
To what do we owe the honor?

149
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:37,905
Just checking in.

150
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:41,119
Why, you got somethin' goin' on?

151
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:43,219
Nothing too sexy.

152
00:11:43,242 --> 00:11:46,726
Just pushing a case up a hill,
inch by inch on Kintel Williamson...

153
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,405
our stated target.

154
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:50,469
We're workin' too, Lester.

155
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:51,748
Yeah, on your own thing.

156
00:11:54,188 --> 00:11:56,311
You even listening to me, McNulty?

157
00:11:56,358 --> 00:11:57,680
I got a real case to bring in.

158
00:11:57,715 --> 00:12:00,120
Fella name of Stringer Bell.
You mighta heard of him.

159
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:01,785
You got a mouth on you, boy.

160
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,991
He's still out there, Lester.

161
00:12:04,296 --> 00:12:05,891
He's got his corners, his money...

162
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,413
fuck it, by now, for all you know

163
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,137
he's got all that
downtown real estate.

164
00:12:09,172 --> 00:12:11,072
Motherfucker probably
owns half of Baltimore

165
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:12,222
without us even knowing it.

166
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:13,301
That ain't the point...

167
00:12:13,325 --> 00:12:16,128
Do you even know what happened
to all that real estate, Lester?

168
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,968
All that downtown property
Bell had title on?

169
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:20,129
Fuck no.

170
00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:23,824
He's probably laughing
his balls off right now

171
00:12:23,859 --> 00:12:25,232
at you, me, Daniels, all of us.

172
00:12:25,255 --> 00:12:28,364
You even pretending to speak
for anyone other than yourself, McNulty?

173
00:12:28,386 --> 00:12:29,500
I'm speaking for the job.

174
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:31,365
You wanna talk about police work?

175
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,846
I was doing the job when
you were just dreamin' on it.

176
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:35,148
Daniels was out there, too.

177
00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:38,663
Now, you gonna fuck him when he
pulled you off a got-damn boat?

178
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:40,247
He's a boss, fuck the bosses.

179
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:42,323
Maybe Daniels plays
a few games to get by

180
00:12:42,358 --> 00:12:45,197
but he's cost himself plenty
for the sake of the job!

181
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,135
He's earned some loyalty.

182
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:49,294
Fuck loyalty and fuck you, Lester.

183
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:50,420
I never thought I'd hear

184
00:12:50,443 --> 00:12:52,649
chain-of-command horseshit
come outta your mouth.

185
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:55,511
Motherfucker, I've spent a lot
of time in a lot of weak units.

186
00:12:55,522 --> 00:12:56,705
More than you.

187
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:59,145
Now, this here?
May not be perfect

188
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:01,859
- but it's a chance to be police.
- Well, then be one.

189
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:11,035
You're not even worth the skin
off my knuckles, junior.

190
00:13:11,587 --> 00:13:12,619
Jimmy, don't...

191
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,969
You put fire to everything
you touch, McNulty

192
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,681
then you walk away while it burns.

193
00:13:18,807 --> 00:13:20,415
I got nothin' more to say to you.

194
00:13:21,107 --> 00:13:21,975
Nothin'.

195
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:25,881
And you.

196
00:13:26,315 --> 00:13:28,074
I'm surprised at you, girl.

197
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,394
Daniels raised you from a pup.

198
00:13:37,118 --> 00:13:38,878
Gotta get with Bubs.

199
00:13:50,924 --> 00:13:52,567
Check on those fucking properties.

200
00:13:57,247 --> 00:14:00,027
Well, Major Colvin,
what do you think?

201
00:14:01,984 --> 00:14:03,485
It all sounds good.

202
00:14:04,248 --> 00:14:07,321
But before I give you a final answer,
I need to speak with my wife.

203
00:14:07,415 --> 00:14:09,468
I'm not talking about the position.

204
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,884
Your cheesecake.

205
00:14:13,842 --> 00:14:15,179
The cheesecake's fine.

206
00:14:15,343 --> 00:14:17,830
They bring it in from Michael's,
out on York Road.

207
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,669
It's got a little
cinnamon in the crust.

208
00:14:20,857 --> 00:14:21,736
None better.

209
00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:26,166
Course, I like to think our
offer's pretty damn good, too.

210
00:14:27,644 --> 00:14:30,389
Excuse me while I go to the
little boy's room, gentlemen.

211
00:14:30,424 --> 00:14:31,586
I need to tinkle.

212
00:14:36,546 --> 00:14:37,321
Tinkle?

213
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,875
I never understood why
a grown-ass man gotta talk like that.

214
00:14:41,145 --> 00:14:44,065
He need to take a piss,
whether he know it or not.

215
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:46,786
You'll get used to these
academic types, Bunny.

216
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,944
'Specially when you get
that first paycheck.

217
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:51,489
I mean, 80k is
nothin' to sneeze at

218
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:53,061
for a number two security job.

219
00:14:53,308 --> 00:14:55,466
Full bennies
on top of your pension.

220
00:14:55,669 --> 00:14:57,089
Yeah, it is generous.

221
00:14:57,476 --> 00:14:58,086
And dull...

222
00:14:58,966 --> 00:14:59,810
in a good way.

223
00:14:59,881 --> 00:15:00,420
I mean...

224
00:15:01,664 --> 00:15:03,435
the worst you'll
ever see is a rape.

225
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,936
A date rape, maybe.

226
00:15:05,886 --> 00:15:08,028
You're ready to take it
down a notch, aren't you?

227
00:15:08,063 --> 00:15:08,791
Hell yes.

228
00:15:08,861 --> 00:15:10,198
Yeah, that's how I felt.

229
00:15:11,313 --> 00:15:13,835
My only regret was that
I didn't tell the deputy ops

230
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,720
to stick it in his ass
on my way out the fucking door.

231
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:20,339
Johns Hopkins wants you, Bunny.

232
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,368
And they wanna pay
Johns Hopkins money.

233
00:15:22,615 --> 00:15:23,330
But what?

234
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:25,360
You gotta ask your wife?

235
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,119
Oh man, I ain't gotta
ask her nothin'.

236
00:15:27,131 --> 00:15:27,940
I'm just...

237
00:15:28,283 --> 00:15:30,547
letting Mr. Jenkins
stew a little, is all.

238
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,761
Wonder what's keeping him.

239
00:15:34,664 --> 00:15:36,095
All he had to do was tinkle.

240
00:15:36,142 --> 00:15:38,488
I guess he felt the need
to make a dookie, too.

241
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:23,183
They got corners up on Argyle
and along Freemont up top.

242
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,192
Avenue corners belong to everybody.

243
00:16:28,778 --> 00:16:31,793
Some who was with Barksdale,
some independent-like.

244
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,980
McHenry Street got some
of Barksdale's people too

245
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:38,452
but gangster Webster's crews
is right beside 'em.

246
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,220
What about the Lower Avenue
corners and the Poe Homes?

247
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,387
They belong to a young
boy name Marlo.

248
00:16:43,797 --> 00:16:44,935
Go by the name a Black.

249
00:16:45,111 --> 00:16:45,885
Marlo?

250
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:47,328
Young boy.

251
00:16:47,727 --> 00:16:50,132
Got all that good real
estate near downtown?

252
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:52,654
Got hisself the lunchtime trade.

253
00:16:52,982 --> 00:16:55,213
If Bell and Barksdale
were gonna hold anything

254
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:57,419
they'd hold onto the Homes
and Avenue corners.

255
00:16:57,454 --> 00:16:59,213
Is Marlo one of
Barksdale's people?

256
00:17:01,032 --> 00:17:02,191
Marlo what?

257
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:06,367
C'mon, you got anything
else on this guy?

258
00:17:06,379 --> 00:17:07,786
You got another tip, maybe?

259
00:17:09,077 --> 00:17:10,754
So much for the hourly wage.

260
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:14,731
1-0-7-m-7-0-3.

261
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,634
Yeah.

262
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:20,478
That's the tag on the truck he ride.

263
00:17:20,877 --> 00:17:23,670
1-0-7-m-7-0-3.

264
00:17:29,706 --> 00:17:31,067
Did you prime it?

265
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,663
That little rubber ball right
there, next to the spark plug.

266
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:38,725
You gotta push it in three times
before you try to start it.

267
00:17:38,901 --> 00:17:40,637
Gets the gas goin' to the carb.

268
00:17:41,587 --> 00:17:44,934
You want the truth, I ain't
never used one of these.

269
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:46,319
Never had no call to.

270
00:17:46,389 --> 00:17:49,533
Yeah, well, I didn't pick you up
for your landscaping skills.

271
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:51,316
All these Spanish?

272
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:52,722
They on paper, too.

273
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:55,057
I only use people like y'all.

274
00:17:55,514 --> 00:17:59,021
Sometimes it comes back on me,
sometimes it works out fine.

275
00:18:00,441 --> 00:18:02,001
How long you been uptown?

276
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:03,291
10 years.

277
00:18:05,095 --> 00:18:06,960
Hotter than a motherfucker out here.

278
00:18:07,582 --> 00:18:08,497
Yeah, it's hot.

279
00:18:09,177 --> 00:18:10,127
Every day.

280
00:18:10,913 --> 00:18:13,259
You gonna be ridin'
in the back of that hard truck

281
00:18:13,283 --> 00:18:14,280
bouncin' around

282
00:18:14,585 --> 00:18:15,718
every day.

283
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:19,437
And your back's gonna
be yellin' at you, every day.

284
00:18:21,302 --> 00:18:22,440
I used to drive an SL.

285
00:18:22,557 --> 00:18:24,938
Pretty gold convertible, nice rims.

286
00:18:25,811 --> 00:18:27,676
I don't even think
on that car no more.

287
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:30,374
You put it behind you, huh?

288
00:18:30,714 --> 00:18:31,782
Some can't.

289
00:18:33,048 --> 00:18:35,911
I'm just sayin':
You wanna stay on the straight

290
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:38,121
ain't gonna be no big reward to it.

291
00:18:38,286 --> 00:18:39,869
This is it right here.

292
00:18:41,277 --> 00:18:43,693
Prime that bitch three times.
She'll start right up.

293
00:18:59,777 --> 00:19:00,492
Miss Pearlman.

294
00:19:00,926 --> 00:19:01,806
Cedric.

295
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:06,404
How goes Kintel Williamson?

296
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:09,264
- Anything there for me yet?
- No, not yet.

297
00:19:11,071 --> 00:19:11,892
We'll get there.

298
00:19:13,006 --> 00:19:14,965
Is that all you
came by to tell me?

299
00:19:15,505 --> 00:19:17,393
Just keeping the lines
of dialogue open.

300
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:19,557
So, what's on your plate?

301
00:19:19,786 --> 00:19:22,843
Oh, there's plenty of
surprises around here.

302
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:38,950
Parole hearing?

303
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:40,721
This soon?

304
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,865
He fingered a dirty guard up
at Jessup, apparently.

305
00:19:43,947 --> 00:19:45,976
Got a big gold star
next to his name.

306
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:47,442
That's some bullshit.

307
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:48,686
Not to worry.

308
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,818
They send me the hearing
notifications for a reason.

309
00:19:55,347 --> 00:19:59,159
"Mr. Barksdale ran a continuous,
violent criminal enterprise

310
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:01,634
and was a major drug trafficker. "

311
00:20:02,564 --> 00:20:06,176
"During the years 1999 to 2002

312
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,434
he was strongly suspected
to have ordered or caused

313
00:20:10,446 --> 00:20:12,593
the deaths of over
a dozen individuals. "

314
00:20:12,624 --> 00:20:15,898
Parole commission's not gonna
walk him on his first trip to the plate.

315
00:20:15,944 --> 00:20:17,598
Not after a letter like that.

316
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:18,255
Good work.

317
00:20:18,807 --> 00:20:19,792
I have my moments.

318
00:20:21,252 --> 00:20:22,625
Nice suit, by the way.

319
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:25,344
Thanks.

320
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:29,203
I see you dress left.

321
00:20:36,716 --> 00:20:37,408
Everyday.

322
00:20:57,302 --> 00:20:59,684
<i>The number you've called
is no longer in service. </i>

323
00:20:59,703 --> 00:21:01,815
<i>If you feel you've reached
this recording in error</i>

324
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:03,504
<i>please check
the number and dial... </i>

325
00:21:07,134 --> 00:21:08,219
<i>Nothing?</i>

326
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:10,583
That address up off Reisterstown.

327
00:21:10,606 --> 00:21:12,457
Same one he was
showing two years ago

328
00:21:12,495 --> 00:21:14,114
when I ran the car he was using.

329
00:21:14,137 --> 00:21:16,037
Stringer's a settled guy.

330
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,046
Not there he ain't.

331
00:21:17,726 --> 00:21:19,599
Woman living there,
last time I checked.

332
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,561
Just a front name.

333
00:21:20,596 --> 00:21:21,511
His girl maybe.

334
00:21:22,403 --> 00:21:25,476
Not unless he likes 'em over
50 and asshole ugly.

335
00:21:27,425 --> 00:21:28,914
I'm sure she's real nice though.

336
00:21:28,926 --> 00:21:31,507
Good school spirit...
always says "hi" to you in the halls.

337
00:21:31,518 --> 00:21:33,149
You think he met her in college?

338
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,087
What, what'd I say?

339
00:21:42,696 --> 00:21:43,669
What you got?

340
00:21:44,139 --> 00:21:46,719
Tag comes back to
an address over on Dukeland.

341
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:48,667
Female, 53 years...

342
00:21:48,713 --> 00:21:49,922
See? That's how they do...

343
00:21:50,256 --> 00:21:52,814
But I got a hit on a Marlo,
street name of Black.

344
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:54,773
Marlo Stanfield.

345
00:21:55,207 --> 00:21:56,356
22 years

346
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:57,729
BPI number

347
00:21:58,385 --> 00:21:59,617
and a pretty good sheet.

348
00:21:59,893 --> 00:22:01,518
What, you thought he'd be cherry?

349
00:22:01,535 --> 00:22:04,691
Oh, I knew he had his cherry
busted, but not like this.

350
00:22:04,843 --> 00:22:05,747
Check it out.

351
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,259
Think I'm gonna take
a ride downtown to homicide.

352
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:14,869
Wanna come?

353
00:22:15,081 --> 00:22:16,641
Nope, got someplace to be.

354
00:22:17,966 --> 00:22:19,151
This thing with Lester?

355
00:22:20,066 --> 00:22:21,556
I feel like shit about it.

356
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,272
Well, you get used to it...

357
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,577
<i>We roll up
and get out of the car. </i>

358
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:33,875
<i>Crowd parts like the red sea. </i>

359
00:22:33,898 --> 00:22:36,279
<i>Victim on the ground,
bleeding all over the place. </i>

360
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,485
<i>Screaming "I'm going
to kill that fucking bitch. "</i>

361
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,221
<i>But nothing's really
wrong with him... </i>

362
00:23:01,194 --> 00:23:02,625
Ah, shit.

363
00:23:03,188 --> 00:23:04,854
You tried to sneak
by me, didn't ya?

364
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:07,288
I was just comin' in
quiet and respectful.

365
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:09,822
Well, for a big man,
you do have a dancer's grace.

366
00:23:09,845 --> 00:23:11,757
But I, sir, I have
the eyes of an eagle.

367
00:23:12,297 --> 00:23:15,599
And the fact that you tried
to slither into your work space undetected

368
00:23:15,681 --> 00:23:19,364
does not bode well for the recovery
prospect of our missing firearm, does it?

369
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:20,385
I'll get it.

370
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,449
What up, Mr. Bunk?

371
00:23:22,989 --> 00:23:24,326
Hey, girlfriend.

372
00:23:24,608 --> 00:23:25,922
Vernon Holley working tonight?

373
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,880
Uh, yeah, he's four-to-twelve.

374
00:23:28,068 --> 00:23:29,640
You should try the coffee room.

375
00:23:30,473 --> 00:23:31,118
Alright.

376
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,794
Man, I would murder that.

377
00:23:38,005 --> 00:23:39,049
If she wasn't...

378
00:23:40,022 --> 00:23:40,832
particular?

379
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:43,410
<i>Hey Busfield, that line
is blinkin' for you. </i>

380
00:23:43,504 --> 00:23:45,580
- Find that gun.
- Yeah, okay.

381
00:23:50,143 --> 00:23:51,715
Motherfuck you, too.

382
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,796
Marlo Stanfield

383
00:23:55,996 --> 00:23:57,345
A.K.A. Black.

384
00:23:57,438 --> 00:23:59,503
Boy's the spawn of the devil, Kima.

385
00:23:59,544 --> 00:24:00,259
I see.

386
00:24:00,775 --> 00:24:02,589
Y'all damn near
had him on this murder.

387
00:24:03,005 --> 00:24:04,004
What happened?

388
00:24:04,475 --> 00:24:05,407
We had a wit.

389
00:24:05,656 --> 00:24:08,652
Boy they called Pooh Bear,
chubby fella with braids.

390
00:24:09,135 --> 00:24:11,066
We stashed Pooh over
in east Baltimore.

391
00:24:11,265 --> 00:24:13,912
Even had him wear one of
those e-lectronic bracelets

392
00:24:13,945 --> 00:24:15,393
so we could find him quick.

393
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:16,491
You lost him?

394
00:24:16,591 --> 00:24:17,556
Not exactly.

395
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,452
Pooh went back to the Westside
to cop some hydro.

396
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:23,282
He could've bought the same
weed where he was, right?

397
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,651
We found him with two in his
chest and one in his mouth.

398
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:29,397
The bracelet led us right
to the spot where he fell.

399
00:24:29,597 --> 00:24:30,629
Those things work.

400
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,592
Marlo's serious.

401
00:24:33,858 --> 00:24:35,206
That motherfucker's real.

402
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:38,867
I dunno, I think a volcano's
way better than a computer.

403
00:24:39,716 --> 00:24:41,447
You see computers every day.

404
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,028
How often do you see a volcano?

405
00:24:43,078 --> 00:24:44,792
Yeah, like I built the computer.

406
00:24:44,825 --> 00:24:46,473
Hey, you built the volcano.

407
00:24:46,506 --> 00:24:47,289
Big whoop.

408
00:24:49,297 --> 00:24:50,162
Can I keep it?

409
00:24:50,695 --> 00:24:51,776
Yeah, if you want to.

410
00:24:58,383 --> 00:24:59,715
- Night, Mikey.
- Night.

411
00:25:00,014 --> 00:25:01,229
- Sleep tight.
- Okay.

412
00:25:04,658 --> 00:25:05,773
It's good that you came.

413
00:25:06,123 --> 00:25:07,071
He's very proud.

414
00:25:08,037 --> 00:25:08,869
Glad to.

415
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:15,381
Jimmy, um, there's
a problem with the alimony.

416
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:16,646
What's the problem?

417
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:19,608
You're behind by like four months.

418
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:22,974
What can I tell you?
I'm paying 2,000 a month in support.

419
00:25:22,991 --> 00:25:24,405
After that, there's nothing left.

420
00:25:24,455 --> 00:25:25,021
Right.

421
00:25:25,104 --> 00:25:27,434
But you signed a separation
agreement that gives me

422
00:25:27,451 --> 00:25:28,733
another 1,000 in alimony...

423
00:25:28,766 --> 00:25:32,160
Elena, I only signed that fucking thing
'cause I thought we'd be together.

424
00:25:32,326 --> 00:25:33,391
Look at how much I make

425
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:36,254
I'm not even close to being able
to pay that much every month.

426
00:25:36,354 --> 00:25:38,834
My lawyer says that
we have to serve you.

427
00:25:39,562 --> 00:25:42,192
What, that suit of a boyfriend
won't cough up any cash?

428
00:25:45,854 --> 00:25:47,868
Blood from a stone, darlin'.

429
00:25:55,447 --> 00:25:56,446
Beginning today

430
00:25:57,461 --> 00:25:59,575
you can sell drugs
in west Baltimore

431
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:02,013
but only where we say you can.

432
00:26:03,777 --> 00:26:04,543
Push 'em.

433
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:05,658
Hard.

434
00:26:06,007 --> 00:26:08,121
Get to it, people.
And don't get captured.

435
00:26:14,351 --> 00:26:15,283
Stay right there.

436
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:16,931
Get him up against the wall.

437
00:26:17,463 --> 00:26:19,327
Hey, listen to what
I'm tellin' you.

438
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,170
You know, kids.

439
00:26:32,586 --> 00:26:35,036
This is a simple fucking
thing we're saying here.

440
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:37,915
If you stay on this corner,
you're going in a wagon.

441
00:26:38,165 --> 00:26:40,528
If you move yourself
down to the free zone

442
00:26:40,661 --> 00:26:42,725
down to the vacants
along Vincent Street

443
00:26:42,992 --> 00:26:45,058
then you can do
whatever the fuck you want.

444
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:46,656
How much fairer can we be?

445
00:26:46,706 --> 00:26:48,104
Yeah, I saw that, you little fuck.

446
00:26:48,204 --> 00:26:49,053
What's your name?

447
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:51,450
You got a name?

448
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:53,097
Peanut Butter and Jelly.

449
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,495
Address?

450
00:26:55,212 --> 00:26:56,427
What's your address?

451
00:26:56,827 --> 00:26:58,175
I stay over on Dolphin Street.

452
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,839
Your address, numbnuts.

453
00:27:00,422 --> 00:27:03,135
Are there any numbers on the
front of your fucking house?

454
00:27:05,604 --> 00:27:06,519
Listen up.

455
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:09,848
This corner is indicted.

456
00:27:10,197 --> 00:27:12,244
We're coming back
tomorrow and when we do

457
00:27:12,294 --> 00:27:13,609
everybody wears bracelets...

458
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:16,688
unless you move your shit
down to Vincent Street

459
00:27:16,871 --> 00:27:18,574
down where the houses are all vacant.

460
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:21,038
You do that, we don't give a shit.

461
00:27:21,154 --> 00:27:22,918
Vincent Street is like Switzerland.

462
00:27:23,451 --> 00:27:24,666
Or Amsterdam.

463
00:27:24,949 --> 00:27:26,080
The fuck is that?

464
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,280
It's one of those countries
where drugs are legal.

465
00:27:28,497 --> 00:27:31,043
Vincent Street is
your Amsterdam in Baltimore.

466
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:32,857
You go down there,
we don't give a fuck.

467
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,921
You stay here, you go to jail.

468
00:27:40,173 --> 00:27:41,888
I ain't goin' to no Hamsterdam.

469
00:27:43,202 --> 00:27:44,351
Killed a witness, huh?

470
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:46,282
The way that Vernon Holley
told it, yeah.

471
00:27:46,348 --> 00:27:47,413
So, Marlo's a hitter.

472
00:27:48,295 --> 00:27:49,644
Maybe he works for Stringer.

473
00:27:49,993 --> 00:27:50,942
Makes sense.

474
00:27:51,524 --> 00:27:53,338
If you need me,
I'm gonna be Westside.

475
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:54,387
What about you?

476
00:27:54,503 --> 00:27:56,517
I gotta get the scent
of my boy, Stringer.

477
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,415
We been off him too long.

478
00:27:58,531 --> 00:27:59,613
What's your first move?

479
00:27:59,713 --> 00:28:00,828
Something Prez said.

480
00:28:01,812 --> 00:28:02,694
P- and-p?

481
00:28:03,676 --> 00:28:05,590
B- and-b, like the liquor.

482
00:28:05,673 --> 00:28:07,904
You mean, liqueur, Plauzinski...

483
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:08,686
Prez-blew-skee.

484
00:28:08,736 --> 00:28:10,150
Benedictine and brandy.

485
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,070
That was invented by
a bartender over at Club 21.

486
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:15,134
All that good shit
comes outta New York.

487
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,712
I need every deed transfer
involving that company, Harry.

488
00:28:18,828 --> 00:28:19,444
Today.

489
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:39,455
Yo, I'm asking them corner boys

490
00:28:39,489 --> 00:28:41,769
if they know where
the Barksdale package be at?

491
00:28:41,802 --> 00:28:43,916
They lookin' at me
like I ain't even talkin'.

492
00:28:45,295 --> 00:28:47,975
On this strip,
Marlo's the name ringin' out.

493
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:48,924
There he is.

494
00:28:49,523 --> 00:28:50,139
Ya see him?

495
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:03,523
He didn't stay too long.

496
00:29:04,455 --> 00:29:05,570
Marlo's ghostin'.

497
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,366
We're kinda sensitive about
giving out personal data

498
00:29:09,383 --> 00:29:10,681
on matriculating students.

499
00:29:10,731 --> 00:29:12,828
Well, I could come back
with a court order.

500
00:29:13,444 --> 00:29:15,058
Then'd have to give it to you.

501
00:29:16,931 --> 00:29:19,194
My man has serious
issues with women.

502
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,706
Domestic violence,
really ugly stuff.

503
00:29:27,607 --> 00:29:29,472
I can't show you any paper.

504
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,368
But let me get my screen up.

505
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:38,509
What did we tell you?

506
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:40,153
What'd we fuckin' tell you, man?

507
00:29:40,203 --> 00:29:43,332
We told you to get your selves
down to the free zone, didn't we?

508
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:45,279
We're tryin'
to give you guys a break.

509
00:29:45,978 --> 00:29:47,774
We're offerin' you, uh...

510
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:50,054
amnesty.

511
00:29:50,304 --> 00:29:52,201
You take your crew
down to Vincent Street

512
00:29:52,268 --> 00:29:54,814
you do your dirt,
nobody's gonna bother you.

513
00:29:55,263 --> 00:29:56,177
Whad'ya say?

514
00:29:57,775 --> 00:29:59,439
You guys fucking braindead?

515
00:29:59,838 --> 00:30:00,770
Whad'ya say?

516
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:06,379
Yo, chief how you gonna come
up here and try to game us?

517
00:30:06,413 --> 00:30:06,845
Say what?

518
00:30:07,328 --> 00:30:09,492
I'm sayin' ya actin' like
we retarded or somethin'.

519
00:30:09,525 --> 00:30:11,056
Better we put a foot in your ass?

520
00:30:11,073 --> 00:30:12,121
Least we'd understand it.

521
00:30:12,138 --> 00:30:13,419
This ain't a trick, shitbird.

522
00:30:13,453 --> 00:30:15,433
Look: we grind,
and y'all try to stop it.

523
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:16,465
That's how we do.

524
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:19,193
Why you gotta go
and fuck with the program?

525
00:30:20,574 --> 00:30:21,606
All due respect.

526
00:30:27,531 --> 00:30:29,073
Nothing but tumbleweeds.

527
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,217
Get me some buses.

528
00:30:34,482 --> 00:30:36,196
Tomorrow, we clean the corners

529
00:30:36,912 --> 00:30:39,408
put 'em all in one place
and give 'em the news.

530
00:30:41,226 --> 00:30:42,757
And I'm not asking anymore.

531
00:30:51,988 --> 00:30:54,838
From here to Freemont
you got Barksdale's people

532
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,891
eastsiders and freelancers, too.

533
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,484
On the same corners?

534
00:30:58,689 --> 00:30:59,141
Yup.

535
00:31:00,412 --> 00:31:01,828
That shit don't make sense.

536
00:31:02,423 --> 00:31:04,207
Yo, can we call it a day, Kima?

537
00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:09,367
Bullshit, man.

538
00:31:10,351 --> 00:31:11,151
You too?

539
00:31:11,664 --> 00:31:13,428
What the fuck is up
with these phones?

540
00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:15,500
I be seein' kids
throwin' them away all day.

541
00:31:15,808 --> 00:31:17,442
They got cash
like that to waste?

542
00:31:17,832 --> 00:31:19,288
These shits be layin' all over.

543
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:21,421
Sometimes you get lucky
find some minutes on 'em

544
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,042
sell 'em for walkin' around money.

545
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:24,908
They burners, Kima.

546
00:31:25,544 --> 00:31:26,078
Burners?

547
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:33,077
Marone, another murder.
In Waverly, no less.

548
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:33,938
You believe it?

549
00:31:34,738 --> 00:31:35,908
I would be fuckin' shocked

550
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:38,328
if it was an african-american
perpetrated the crime.

551
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:40,047
It ain't even funny, Ang.

552
00:31:41,003 --> 00:31:44,276
This is why everyone's leaving this city,
black and white.

553
00:31:45,292 --> 00:31:47,579
I was at a community meeting
Sunday in west Baltimore.

554
00:31:47,594 --> 00:31:49,925
People were spittin' mad.
And I can't say I blame them.

555
00:31:49,939 --> 00:31:51,987
Well, they could move
to a better neighborhood.

556
00:31:52,002 --> 00:31:53,900
That is, if they were
willing to work for it.

557
00:31:53,915 --> 00:31:56,619
Come on, I been hearin' all that
my-poor-immigrant-father-made-it

558
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:58,652
- so-why-can't-the-blacks
bullshit my whole life.

559
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,710
You think there's not good
people on the Westside

560
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,279
who want the same things that you...

561
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:03,176
Okay, Mrs. Roosevelt.

562
00:32:03,205 --> 00:32:05,088
All's I'm sayin' is,
it's not about color.

563
00:32:06,105 --> 00:32:07,719
So what's your next move, Tommy?

564
00:32:08,466 --> 00:32:11,789
The Sun says an Anderson's state
senate seat is up for grabs.

565
00:32:11,893 --> 00:32:15,211
Fuck that, you could go after
Ruppersberger in the second.

566
00:32:15,241 --> 00:32:16,421
He's only got one term.

567
00:32:22,061 --> 00:32:23,421
I'm gonna run for mayor.

568
00:32:28,801 --> 00:32:29,443
Mayor Tommy.

569
00:32:36,207 --> 00:32:37,373
She in the right joint?

570
00:32:55,869 --> 00:32:58,514
She lets me sit next to her,
I buy her a drink...

571
00:32:58,574 --> 00:32:59,694
We each give you 10.

572
00:33:00,352 --> 00:33:01,503
20 if you fuck her.

573
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,870
Oh please, show just
a little more class, besides

574
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,444
I already had my day in the sun.

575
00:33:07,356 --> 00:33:09,239
Bullshit, Tommy.
Once a gash-hound...

576
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:11,137
The bet is the bet,
you said I lost a step.

577
00:33:11,152 --> 00:33:12,437
I'm gonna prove I never did.

578
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,397
- You in, Pete?
- I'll pass.

579
00:33:32,324 --> 00:33:33,565
The sonofabitch did it.

580
00:33:34,191 --> 00:33:34,908
He did you.

581
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,225
That's Theresa d'Agostino.

582
00:33:37,628 --> 00:33:38,734
Mario Dee's kid?

583
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,617
Yeah, she grew up alright.

584
00:33:40,826 --> 00:33:43,053
She's down in D.C.
Now with the national party.

585
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:44,335
A campaign fixer.

586
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:45,695
No shit.

587
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,056
Tommy's known her
ever since law school.

588
00:33:48,534 --> 00:33:49,909
Just hear me out, okay?

589
00:33:50,866 --> 00:33:52,255
- One drink.
- Go ahead.

590
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:53,600
You're paying for it.

591
00:33:53,645 --> 00:33:55,470
Actually, they are.

592
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,577
You made a bet.

593
00:33:58,638 --> 00:34:00,626
Don't tell me we have
to kiss or something.

594
00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:01,492
Not gonna happen.

595
00:34:03,017 --> 00:34:06,377
This isn't about ankle straps
and a two-and-a-half star hotel, is it?

596
00:34:06,465 --> 00:34:08,407
Because the Alumni dinner
ended an hour ago

597
00:34:08,437 --> 00:34:10,144
and I could be back
in D.C. right now...

598
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:11,172
That's the old me, Terri.

599
00:34:11,187 --> 00:34:13,623
Everything I got now,
my wife, my kids...

600
00:34:15,288 --> 00:34:16,723
I would not risk losing them.

601
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:18,202
No way.

602
00:34:18,486 --> 00:34:21,325
Seeing you with your old gang
made me think bad thoughts.

603
00:34:22,088 --> 00:34:24,015
Your friends cheapen you, Tommy.

604
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:26,502
You're just pissed off
that they didn't recognize you

605
00:34:26,517 --> 00:34:27,413
when you walked in.

606
00:34:27,578 --> 00:34:28,609
And why would they?

607
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:31,493
I mean, you're a Washingtonian now.

608
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,153
That's Pete Sinopoli
over there, isn't it?

609
00:34:35,455 --> 00:34:36,994
I hear he's back to practicing law.

610
00:34:37,024 --> 00:34:37,382
Yeah.

611
00:34:37,412 --> 00:34:38,862
He just didn't have it, did he?

612
00:34:39,654 --> 00:34:40,685
I have it, Terri.

613
00:34:42,702 --> 00:34:44,316
I'm gonna make a run for mayor.

614
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:47,268
And you're gonna run my campaign.

615
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:51,243
Gimme one good reason why not to.

616
00:34:51,288 --> 00:34:52,528
I could give you 10.

617
00:34:52,812 --> 00:34:55,308
But here's the good one:
You're the wrong color.

618
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:56,892
You're not electable here.

619
00:34:57,255 --> 00:34:58,809
And I never play the longshot.

620
00:34:58,988 --> 00:35:00,109
You like to win.

621
00:35:00,274 --> 00:35:01,484
I don't like to lose.

622
00:35:01,858 --> 00:35:03,023
It's not the same thing.

623
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:05,534
But where's the fun in it
if you know you're gonna win?

624
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:07,487
I mean, you handled that
democrat in east L.A.

625
00:35:07,517 --> 00:35:08,668
What was his name, Garcia...

626
00:35:08,698 --> 00:35:09,699
- Valdez.
- Valdez.

627
00:35:10,805 --> 00:35:11,701
How hard was that?

628
00:35:15,946 --> 00:35:18,741
I need someone like you on my side.

629
00:35:21,132 --> 00:35:21,804
I need you.

630
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:25,391
How big a win bonus?

631
00:35:26,287 --> 00:35:28,390
Get a white mayor elected
in Baltimore, honey

632
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,647
you name your price.

633
00:35:31,558 --> 00:35:32,589
One drink was the deal.

634
00:35:34,696 --> 00:35:36,265
Go home, sleep it off.

635
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,612
You'll wake up and realize
you're making a mistake.

636
00:35:40,107 --> 00:35:41,212
I can do this.

637
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:44,709
Question is, are you
gonna come with me?

638
00:36:14,958 --> 00:36:15,705
B and B.

639
00:36:19,499 --> 00:36:20,010
<i>Hello?</i>

640
00:36:34,645 --> 00:36:37,741
Yo, how we not going to throw
a few hot ones at the motherfuckers?

641
00:36:38,011 --> 00:36:40,951
One ass-whuppin' an'
we back off like some bitches.

642
00:36:41,235 --> 00:36:43,398
Now we on this
off-brand strip right here.

643
00:36:43,427 --> 00:36:45,543
Not even enough trade
for poot and his crew.

644
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:46,551
This is bullshit, man.

645
00:36:46,565 --> 00:36:49,079
Look, man, String gonna
fix it, you'll see.

646
00:36:49,421 --> 00:36:51,083
Which one a y'all is Slim Charles?

647
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:52,319
Who ask?

648
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:53,554
That be Cutty.

649
00:36:54,151 --> 00:36:56,295
Your boy gave me a number,
said to ring you up

650
00:36:56,324 --> 00:36:58,099
when I was ready
to put in some work.

651
00:36:58,345 --> 00:36:59,206
But no answer.

652
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:01,302
Took your time
callin' back, right?

653
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:03,983
Numbers don't play
after a few days, man.

654
00:37:03,998 --> 00:37:06,079
- We change 'em up.
- Ain't you know nothin'?

655
00:37:06,549 --> 00:37:08,113
Respect, dawg, respect.

656
00:37:08,551 --> 00:37:10,695
Y'all don't know
who ya'll talkin' to, man.

657
00:37:11,352 --> 00:37:12,921
You still ain't say your business.

658
00:37:12,953 --> 00:37:14,517
I'm tryin' to get put on.

659
00:37:14,611 --> 00:37:15,706
What you got in mind?

660
00:37:15,753 --> 00:37:17,333
Whatever you got that pays.

661
00:37:17,709 --> 00:37:18,444
Yo, Poot.

662
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:19,828
Come here, man.

663
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:25,062
Hey, look, man, call Shamrock, man.

664
00:37:25,093 --> 00:37:27,503
And tell him that soldier
finally came into the camp.

665
00:37:28,442 --> 00:37:29,599
You a soldier, huh?

666
00:37:29,756 --> 00:37:31,680
Chill, Bodie, man, chill, man.

667
00:37:32,433 --> 00:37:33,512
Bodie Broadus?

668
00:37:34,701 --> 00:37:35,593
Yeah, that's right.

669
00:37:35,781 --> 00:37:38,910
Shit, I remember your little ass
when you was still in diapers.

670
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:41,445
I used to spar with
your older brother, James.

671
00:37:42,024 --> 00:37:43,354
That boy had a killer left.

672
00:37:45,591 --> 00:37:47,234
Yeah, when he ain't drop it.

673
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,221
He still out here?

674
00:37:51,233 --> 00:37:52,015
James been dead.

675
00:37:58,493 --> 00:37:59,791
Fuck's up with that cheesebox?

676
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:02,769
You ain't never rid
no school bus before?

677
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:06,258
I'm sayin', what they doin'
with the niggas on that corner?

678
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:06,884
Look, dawg.

679
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,872
First thing, we gonna need
to do is get you some chrome.

680
00:38:10,185 --> 00:38:10,968
C'mon, man.

681
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,498
My phone... shit.

682
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,274
Yo, T.J. You got one
with some minutes left?

683
00:38:24,587 --> 00:38:27,106
...which is not to say that
you couldn't do some multi-use

684
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:28,874
with the Howard Street
properties, too.

685
00:38:28,905 --> 00:38:30,517
Residential-commercial could work.

686
00:38:30,986 --> 00:38:31,847
On Howard Street?

687
00:38:31,882 --> 00:38:33,430
The whole point
of the block grant

688
00:38:33,461 --> 00:38:35,745
is to bring the Westside back
and make it high-end.

689
00:38:35,778 --> 00:38:38,156
The hippodrome project
was just a start, see?

690
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,287
But residential?

691
00:38:40,147 --> 00:38:42,197
With the stadium
and the theater back on line

692
00:38:42,431 --> 00:38:45,029
that whole area is like inner
harbor east 10 years ago.

693
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,249
And the thing is

694
00:38:46,311 --> 00:38:48,721
you're on the ground floor
with what you're holding.

695
00:38:48,752 --> 00:38:50,091
Yes, you are String.

696
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,189
So we're still talking more
return than just flipping

697
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,192
the properties for
the condemnation money.

698
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:55,974
Way more.

699
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:57,367
Excuse me.

700
00:39:00,711 --> 00:39:01,134
Yo.

701
00:39:02,135 --> 00:39:02,558
Naw.

702
00:39:03,387 --> 00:39:04,153
Not right now.

703
00:39:05,108 --> 00:39:05,780
A half hour.

704
00:39:07,361 --> 00:39:08,878
No, Sir, go ahead and fill it up.

705
00:39:09,582 --> 00:39:11,037
You got the order number, right?

706
00:39:18,012 --> 00:39:18,747
Move your ass.

707
00:39:18,763 --> 00:39:19,874
Man, this some bullshit.

708
00:39:41,503 --> 00:39:43,302
My moms is gonna
be worried, and shit.

709
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:44,522
Y'all is kidnappin' niggas.

710
00:39:44,554 --> 00:39:45,367
I'm Major Colvin.

711
00:39:48,532 --> 00:39:50,832
My name is Major Colvin.

712
00:39:51,364 --> 00:39:52,177
<i>Major what?</i>

713
00:39:52,193 --> 00:39:53,570
<i>Major these, motherfucker. </I>

714
00:39:53,586 --> 00:39:55,870
And we had to bring you down
here this afternoon

715
00:39:58,044 --> 00:40:00,708
because you've not been
complying with our directives.

716
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:01,443
Say what?

717
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:04,854
You're haven't been doing
what we asked you to do.

718
00:40:07,232 --> 00:40:07,983
When I'm done.

719
00:40:08,655 --> 00:40:09,672
I gotta pee now.

720
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:13,309
He ain't playin'.

721
00:40:13,324 --> 00:40:15,483
Smell like he already
pissed in his drawers.

722
00:40:17,736 --> 00:40:18,847
Alright, go ahead.

723
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:24,721
Yo, I gotta go, too.

724
00:40:25,253 --> 00:40:26,833
Well, you're just
gonna have to wait.

725
00:40:26,848 --> 00:40:28,914
You just let him go,
how you gonna discriminate?

726
00:40:28,945 --> 00:40:30,588
Yo, faggy, why you touch my butt?

727
00:40:44,562 --> 00:40:46,002
That's enough.

728
00:40:49,162 --> 00:40:50,633
The fun is over.

729
00:40:53,246 --> 00:40:54,182
Tyrell.

730
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:56,670
Why weren't you in school today?

731
00:40:56,858 --> 00:40:59,158
My stomach hurt.
I couldn't make it out the baff-room.

732
00:40:59,205 --> 00:41:01,113
Stand up when I talk
to you, young man.

733
00:41:02,568 --> 00:41:04,180
I know your mother, Tyrell.

734
00:41:05,383 --> 00:41:07,824
She didn't raise any clowns.

735
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:10,014
- Now did she?
- No, ma'am.

736
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,567
It's yours, Major.

737
00:41:27,172 --> 00:41:28,783
Now, ladies and gentlemen

738
00:41:29,816 --> 00:41:31,944
we brought you down here because...

739
00:41:32,788 --> 00:41:34,791
you're here to learn
about the new way...

740
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:40,100
<i>the new way that we're going
to do things on the corners... </i>

741
00:41:53,194 --> 00:41:54,242
That's downtown.

742
00:42:00,365 --> 00:42:01,820
Well, that makes no sense.

743
00:42:02,508 --> 00:42:03,400
All four.

744
00:42:20,185 --> 00:42:22,376
Go ahead, rip me
a new asshole

745
00:42:22,532 --> 00:42:24,332
and ask me where
I been for two days.

746
00:42:24,363 --> 00:42:25,364
'Tell us, hotshot.

747
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:30,047
College registrar gives up
Stringer's course schedule.

748
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:32,081
I tail him to where
he's laying his head.

749
00:42:32,222 --> 00:42:34,788
Downtown high-rise.
Name's on the lease, too.

750
00:42:35,007 --> 00:42:36,102
No attempt to hide it.

751
00:42:36,822 --> 00:42:39,148
I get up early next morning,
follow him from his door

752
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:41,729
to a lunch meeting
with the State Senator.

753
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,187
Same one with the bag man
we bounced the last time around.

754
00:42:45,218 --> 00:42:47,696
Couple of white guys
at the table, too, but nobody I read.

755
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:49,824
And all the while, Stringer's
using his cell phone.

756
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:52,333
Making calls in front of these
suits like it ain't no thing.

757
00:42:52,338 --> 00:42:53,688
Shit, I even
rang it up myself.

758
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:55,530
Got his number from
an admissions form.

759
00:42:55,733 --> 00:42:59,426
Number wouldn't be 732-8793?

760
00:43:01,131 --> 00:43:03,514
I had Prez pull the B-and-B
property assessments

761
00:43:03,545 --> 00:43:05,469
and land transfers
from circuit court.

762
00:43:06,393 --> 00:43:08,818
Some of the paperwork
asked for a contact number.

763
00:43:08,849 --> 00:43:12,533
So, I'm not surprised our boy's
using his cell phone so freely.

764
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:17,258
Those right there are the incoming
and outgoing numbers on his phone.

765
00:43:18,071 --> 00:43:20,403
Damn near all of them
are downtown exchanges.

766
00:43:21,185 --> 00:43:26,859
Architectural firms, city licensing...
attorneys, zoning offices.

767
00:43:26,947 --> 00:43:29,763
Even campus exchanges
over at B.C.C.C.

768
00:43:30,952 --> 00:43:31,964
You sayin' he's right?

769
00:43:31,996 --> 00:43:35,062
I'm saying the phone is right.

770
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:39,881
Account information confirms
he's had that number listed...

771
00:43:40,366 --> 00:43:41,430
for quite awhile.

772
00:43:46,184 --> 00:43:46,779
Nice work.

773
00:43:49,078 --> 00:43:51,644
Maybe the cell phone is clean
because he's keeping it.

774
00:43:51,801 --> 00:43:54,349
If it was dirty,
it probably be a burner.

775
00:43:57,838 --> 00:43:58,777
Disposables.

776
00:44:01,123 --> 00:44:02,453
The latest in yo tech.

777
00:44:02,547 --> 00:44:05,664
They make a few calls with
a burner, throw it away.

778
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:07,933
Go on to the next phone,
do the same.

779
00:44:08,073 --> 00:44:10,373
There's more of those things
laying around the streets

780
00:44:10,405 --> 00:44:12,016
of west Baltimore than empty vials.

781
00:44:12,063 --> 00:44:14,613
Well, how the fuck you supposed
to get a wire up on that?

782
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:17,454
Yeah, well, first it
was payphones and pagers.

783
00:44:17,486 --> 00:44:20,192
Then it was cell phones
and face-to-face meets.

784
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:21,022
Now this.

785
00:44:21,882 --> 00:44:23,384
The motherfuckers do learn.

786
00:44:23,572 --> 00:44:25,903
Every time we come at them,
they learn and adjust.

787
00:44:27,452 --> 00:44:28,031
So...

788
00:44:30,253 --> 00:44:31,551
Stringer's out of reach.

789
00:44:31,614 --> 00:44:33,038
You know, a couple years ago

790
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:36,026
when they were buying up
all that downtown real estate

791
00:44:36,057 --> 00:44:37,938
I thought they were
buying it to flip it

792
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:41,059
and get the cash when
the federal payout money lands

793
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:42,795
and the properties are condemned.

794
00:44:42,819 --> 00:44:44,759
Bell and Barksdale
haven't sold any of it.

795
00:44:44,822 --> 00:44:47,638
They're buying more, in fact,
and applying for building permits.

796
00:44:48,232 --> 00:44:50,939
Seems that Stringer Bell's
worse than a drug dealer.

797
00:44:51,095 --> 00:44:52,097
He's a developer.

798
00:44:52,769 --> 00:44:54,584
Jesus fuck, he's really legit?

799
00:44:54,741 --> 00:44:56,290
Well, you real police?

800
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,888
Now that he's out in the open,
why don't you pull him up and ask him?

801
00:45:00,858 --> 00:45:03,095
You need a few days,
I'll stall Daniels.

802
00:45:03,127 --> 00:45:06,178
But after that, you come home
with a case we can use

803
00:45:06,224 --> 00:45:09,463
or you swallow your got-damn
pride and rejoin this unit.

804
00:45:20,263 --> 00:45:21,374
How you doin', Donette?

805
00:45:28,918 --> 00:45:30,045
I'm fine, String.

806
00:45:30,499 --> 00:45:31,359
I missed you, baby.

807
00:45:34,337 --> 00:45:36,793
Look, I'm sorry for
not returning them calls.

808
00:45:37,357 --> 00:45:39,203
Sorry don't keep
my bed warm at night.

809
00:45:39,891 --> 00:45:41,033
Shorty, I been runnin'.

810
00:45:41,862 --> 00:45:43,928
Ain't like I'm trying
to shut you out

811
00:45:44,003 --> 00:45:45,990
I just got business
to attend to, you know?

812
00:45:47,508 --> 00:45:49,620
Do you know how it feels
to be alone out here?

813
00:45:50,512 --> 00:45:53,344
Police comin' to my door,
and I got no one to stand beside me.

814
00:45:57,987 --> 00:46:00,396
You said the detective
left you... a card.

815
00:46:20,009 --> 00:46:22,059
Man say D'angelo
wadn't no suicide.

816
00:46:22,763 --> 00:46:25,000
Somethin' about the way
the marks was on his neck.

817
00:46:25,986 --> 00:46:28,031
He said Dee coulda
been murdered, and shit.

818
00:46:33,804 --> 00:46:34,351
Sit down.

819
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,125
Now listen to me.

820
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:46,021
Everyone in them walls
know who Avon is.

821
00:46:47,194 --> 00:46:48,805
Ain't nobody
gonna do his nephew.

822
00:46:50,528 --> 00:46:50,966
Alright?

823
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:55,065
Now as far as you
and me go.

824
00:46:56,864 --> 00:46:59,070
I did you wrong by keeping
you at arm's length.

825
00:47:01,073 --> 00:47:02,857
But it ain't gonna
be like that no more.

826
00:47:42,532 --> 00:47:43,571
God made that.

827
00:47:44,526 --> 00:47:45,574
Couldn't be no accident.

828
00:47:46,215 --> 00:47:47,686
So why am I
on your tab tonight?

829
00:47:48,453 --> 00:47:49,110
Tell the truth.

830
00:47:50,252 --> 00:47:52,505
I dare that to walk by me again.
She better not.

831
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:55,082
Why you buyin', Bunk?

832
00:48:00,323 --> 00:48:01,403
I got two dead

833
00:48:02,842 --> 00:48:05,027
in what feels like
a drug rip up in Pimlico.

834
00:48:07,811 --> 00:48:09,625
An' the younguns out on the scene

835
00:48:09,626 --> 00:48:11,582
they seem to know
this Omar fella by sight.

836
00:48:15,404 --> 00:48:16,437
I need Omar, Jimmy.

837
00:48:18,017 --> 00:48:18,440
Again?

838
00:48:19,253 --> 00:48:20,270
Jesus, Bunk.

839
00:48:24,667 --> 00:48:25,245
Yeah...

840
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:27,959
Fuck it, then.

841
00:48:31,448 --> 00:48:32,480
Number three?

842
00:48:33,419 --> 00:48:35,922
Ah, that worked for you last time.

843
00:48:36,082 --> 00:48:38,554
- That blonde by the juke...
- Oh, I really liked her.

844
00:48:38,585 --> 00:48:40,572
Everybody likes everybody
when the kissin'.

845
00:48:41,042 --> 00:48:43,514
But no, my friend
down there

846
00:48:44,578 --> 00:48:45,939
she's a number two, I think.

847
00:48:47,093 --> 00:48:48,962
And when it comes up,
my mother passed...

848
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:50,254
a week ago

849
00:48:50,864 --> 00:48:53,915
and I'm havin' a little
trouble gettin' over it.

850
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,044
That's why I'm feeling
so blue tonight.

851
00:48:57,292 --> 00:48:59,389
Okay, your mom's dead
and you're sad.

852
00:48:59,655 --> 00:48:59,968
Yeah.

853
00:49:03,738 --> 00:49:04,677
You my boy.

854
00:49:11,399 --> 00:49:12,134
The same way.

855
00:49:16,609 --> 00:49:18,283
My mom died about a week ago...

856
00:49:30,187 --> 00:49:31,720
Yo. What's up, boss?

857
00:49:36,852 --> 00:49:39,136
You got the phone receipts
from the Virginia run?

858
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:43,937
Alright.

859
00:49:44,203 --> 00:49:46,315
From now on, I want you
to deal with these.

860
00:49:46,503 --> 00:49:46,910
Alright.

861
00:49:48,631 --> 00:49:51,635
If my man Bernard doin' it like
we said and makin' them runs

862
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:53,919
then I don't wanna have
to deal with this no more.

863
00:49:55,577 --> 00:49:56,125
For sure.

864
00:49:57,345 --> 00:49:58,581
And if Donette call me...

865
00:49:58,832 --> 00:49:59,520
I know.

866
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:01,335
Tell that bitch you busy.

867
00:50:02,029 --> 00:50:04,329
No.
I'm gonna take the call.

868
00:50:34,665 --> 00:50:35,306
Ronnie.

869
00:50:39,749 --> 00:50:41,126
Ronnie, Ronnie!

870
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:45,796
Rhonda!

871
00:51:16,992 --> 00:51:19,010
...it was strongly
suspected to have ordered

872
00:51:19,026 --> 00:51:21,232
or caused the deaths of
over a dozen individuals. "

873
00:51:21,263 --> 00:51:21,733
Suspected.

874
00:51:22,718 --> 00:51:23,845
It's rumor and innuendo.

875
00:51:24,674 --> 00:51:27,808
There isn't one new allegation
in this letter that wasn't already raised

876
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,452
by the assistant state's attorney
at the time of the trial.

877
00:51:30,718 --> 00:51:33,033
And given my client's
superlative record

878
00:51:33,205 --> 00:51:34,394
during his incarceration

879
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:37,727
and given his notable role
in identifying the source

880
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:40,732
of the overdose deaths
at this facility last year

881
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:45,081
I respectfully ask that you
honor our existing agreement

882
00:51:45,097 --> 00:51:46,845
and approve Mr. Barksdale's
early release.

883
00:51:46,892 --> 00:51:49,286
- That's bullshit!
- Hold your comments, trooper.

884
00:51:50,131 --> 00:51:51,555
We made a commitment, Counselor.

885
00:51:51,867 --> 00:51:54,824
And given what this institution
was dealing with a year ago

886
00:51:54,856 --> 00:51:55,998
this is the lesser evil.

887
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:00,127
<i>Rockefeller.
Rockefellers on the spot. </i>

888
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:01,472
That's him right there.

889
00:52:02,067 --> 00:52:03,662
In that G35, man.

890
00:52:04,132 --> 00:52:05,024
Boy in the retro?

891
00:52:05,305 --> 00:52:06,400
That shit is tight.

892
00:52:06,838 --> 00:52:08,830
$430, it better be.

893
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:10,113
Hell, yeah.

894
00:52:10,457 --> 00:52:12,491

one of those motherfuckers.

895
00:52:12,522 --> 00:52:14,462
You better get
the mugsy bogues, then.

00:52:14,744 --> 00:52:16,997

898
00:52:20,131 --> 00:52:22,603
That boy came up short
on that money last week.

So where that money at?

901
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:29,425
You need to look beyond
what he driving or wearin' on his back.

902
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:32,100
That boy got a girlfriend?

903
00:52:32,194 --> 00:52:34,478
He run with this little freak
up at the high school.

904
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:35,636
She wearin' ice?

905
00:52:35,667 --> 00:52:38,327
She wearin' an onion, that's
about all I can remember.

906
00:52:39,579 --> 00:52:40,674
Check out the girl.

907
00:52:41,175 --> 00:52:43,469
High school girl with
platinum around her neck

908
00:52:43,595 --> 00:52:45,628

909
00:52:46,614 --> 00:52:48,022

914
00:52:59,237 --> 00:53:00,708
Don't hold 15, neither.

Game done changed.

916
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,882

918
00:53:12,406 --> 00:53:13,908

919
00:53:15,269 --> 00:53:16,192
Who has time?

920
00:53:18,993 --> 00:53:20,135

a weekend or somethin'?

922
00:53:25,036 --> 00:53:26,397

a thing between you and me.

928
00:54:01,406 --> 00:54:03,064
Nah, I wish you both all the best.

929
00:54:08,357 --> 00:54:10,046
