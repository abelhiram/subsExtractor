1
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,959
Yeah, so we out on Carrollton,

2
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,559
this ol' white motherfucker
and his wife roll up,

3
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,559
he's like, "young man, you know
where the Poe House is?"

4
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,959
I'm like,
"Unc, you kiddin' me?

5
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,960
Look around, take your pick. "

6
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,039
So, the old man,

7
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,539
he's like, "the Poe House.

8
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,440
The Edward Allen Poe House... "

9
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,420
shit, you back already?

10
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,810
First of the month, yo...

11
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,520
I'm like, "I don't know no
Edward Allen Poe. "

12
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,700
The man look at me all sad
and shit like I let him down...

13
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,480
I know you know
you ain't comin' in here.

14
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,350
What?

15
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,930
Shorty, I don't know you.

16
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,779
You know Miss Elaine
in the back room, right?

17
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,879
This her brother,
Earl from the V.A. Hospital.

18
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,680
He supposed to stay with her.

19
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,069
Can you help me inside?

20
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,470
I'm Chantal.

21
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,210
So, what's good?

22
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,390
Thank you, young man.

23
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,960
Oh shit.

24
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,020
Oh shit.

25
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,480
Nah, nah, nah...

26
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,200
Hey, yo, Omar.

27
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,969
Yo, all due respect,

28
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,570
but this right here,

29
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,860
this a Barksdale joint, man.

30
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,960
Do tell.

31
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,095
All Due Respect

32
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,739
You think this boy
woke up yesterday morning,

33
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,339
sat on the edge of his bed

34
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,440
and said:
"Today's my day to die?"

35
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,720
You don't think
this can happen to you?

36
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,210
Doc, hold that up.

37
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,730
Look at what that bullet
did to his heart.

38
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,050
That's his heart.

39
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,789
What was that,
scared straight?

40
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,790
More like bored stiff.

41
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,819
What's the deal with this?

42
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,119
I go down to M.C.I. Jessup hoping
to pull up a fella with some years on him,

43
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,899
see if he's ready
to share his feelings.

44
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,599
Turns out Barksdale D'Angelo
got himself rung up as a suicide.

45
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,100
D.O.D. of 72103.

46
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,509
Who worked it?

47
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,810
State police.

48
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,149
You want me to pull
the postmortem on this?

49
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,056
Yeah, he's kind of
our made guy down there.

50
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:50,651
I just want to make sure
that nobody did the suicide to him.

51
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,590
Ain't nuthin' but dust
an' bricks over there now.

52
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,090
Shit, all that battlin'
we did to take them towers.

53
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,304
You're tryin' to tell me we back
on the street with the rest of 'em.

54
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,409
Anyway, b, now that the towers is gone
everybody knows how it gotta go down.

55
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,795
I say we send our people
over there early.

56
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,010
Corner chiefs like:
"Yo, we here now,

57
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,219
"you know what I mean,
but we bringing something to the table. "

58
00:06:13,231 --> 00:06:14,949
Lay it out like
it's their lucky day.

59
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,250
No flexin', no threats.
Just be like, this a good thing.

60
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,349
But you know
we gonna need good corners,

61
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,735
that's what we're gonna need.
Close to downtown.

62
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,450
Get the workaday trade.

63
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,949
- Come out like Freemont
- Fayette.

64
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,042
Yeah, like 40,
$50,000 a day, easy.

65
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,042
Yeah, I'm on it.

66
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,549
You know everyone
watchin' us on this, man.

67
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,556
They wanna see if we're gonna fuck this up
now that the towers are down.

68
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,550
You know what I'm sin'?
They measurin' us up.

69
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,050
They wanna see
if we're gonna be weak or real.

70
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,829
If a fool step to us, man,
we gonna do what we gotta do.

71
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,230
But it's them bodies
that got you in here.

72
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,980
If we can do this without the bodies,
we should.

73
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,489
You know what I mean?

74
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,289
Especially now
we light on muscle.

75
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,945
Speakin' of muscle, man,
you heard from that man I sent you?

76
00:06:56,968 --> 00:06:59,589
Yeah, Cutty from the cut.
He rang, we took care of him.

77
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,890
Good, good.

78
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,129
How you fixed for the hearing?

79
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,929
It's all good, man.

80
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,130
Shit.

81
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,309
Levy got everything
straightened up tight for me, man.

82
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,110
I'll be home
before it get cold.

83
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,310
Towers came down.

84
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,870
So?

85
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,770
So, we're comin' in.

86
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,430
To my corners?

87
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,779
I don't think so.

88
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,679
Hold on now.
This is gonna be good for you too...

89
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,580
Yeah?

90
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,387
Now, how you figure that?

91
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,000
Yo, what you payin' now, 37, 38?

92
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,324
Yo, we can go 31, 32 shots.

93
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,349
Man, this shit's so John Blaze

94
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:40,350
you can step on it seven, eight times
and still take the cake...

95
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,030
Spider bags!

96
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,850
Spider bags!

97
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,603
Damn!

98
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,950
Yo, y'all seen Marlo?

99
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,590
Y'all ain't seen him?

100
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,900
Y'all know him?

101
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,950
Marlo?

102
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,730
Yeah, yeah, he was here.

103
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,420
Now he ain't.

104
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,640
<i>Get those spider bags,
spider bags!</i>

105
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,909
Jesus, Tommy, I like to shit

106
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:22,610
when I looked up and saw you
on the news, givin' it to Erv.

107
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,994
you fucker,
you're up to something.

108
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,010
I'm up to nothing,
I'm telling you.

109
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,250
I can help him,
he can help me.

110
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,510
A little itch here,
a little scratch there.

111
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,930
This is a win-win
for you, ain't it?

112
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,210
He won't play? You beat the shit
outta him because crime is up.

113
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,180
Press loves it and you score.

114
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,189
Flip-side is that if he caves,

115
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,590
you get yourself a snitch
in the Mayor's inner-circle.

116
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,020
So um...

117
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,587
what's my role
in your little drama?

118
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
I thought you might
broker a meeting.

119
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:01,810
You know,

120
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,424
help your fearless leader see the light
about his new friend on the council.

121
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,909
And I should tell him, what?

122
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,385
Make nice or invest heavily
in petroleum jelly?

123
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,310
Hey, his ass, his choice.

124
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,010
You didn't talk to him?

125
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,640
I couldn't find
the motherfucker.

126
00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:27,733
Man, we just walk up,
we gonna bump.

127
00:09:33,392 --> 00:09:36,255
There.
Middle of the block, right there.

128
00:10:21,976 --> 00:10:23,201
Yo, where the whistle at?

129
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:32,864
Hold on.

130
00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:36,087
Wait for Marlo.

131
00:10:51,202 --> 00:10:53,761
<i>Yo, Cheese.
Where you been at, man?</i>

132
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:03,612
Nigger, that ain't
nothin' but bait.

133
00:11:03,894 --> 00:11:05,193
Just soap your bitch.

134
00:11:10,622 --> 00:11:12,014
Who my dawg?
You my dawg.

135
00:11:12,663 --> 00:11:14,603
Who's my Dawg?
Who's my baby?

136
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:17,168
You make daddy some money, alright?
Yeah.

137
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,249
25 large on Dawg.

138
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:31,127
<i>Cheese!</i>

139
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,835
Yeah.

140
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:51,917
<i>Anybody I want?</i>

141
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:54,076
Anybody.

142
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,362
I want more than one.

143
00:11:58,066 --> 00:11:59,161
I want the Olsen twins.

144
00:11:59,772 --> 00:12:00,413
You got 'em.

145
00:12:01,164 --> 00:12:01,978
Slaves.

146
00:12:02,353 --> 00:12:03,980
All they live for
is to get you off.

147
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:06,750
But so now who
you gonna do for 'em?

148
00:12:07,398 --> 00:12:09,589
One guy, one act, one time.

149
00:12:09,808 --> 00:12:11,716
Right.
And the minute I name a guy

150
00:12:12,061 --> 00:12:14,352
you're gonna be like,
"I knew you were a cocksucker

151
00:12:14,353 --> 00:12:16,007
"from the first time
I laid eyes on you.

152
00:12:16,038 --> 00:12:18,823
Steve McQueen, huh?
That's your fantasy?

153
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,752
You fuckin'
closet-case motherfucker.

154
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:22,818
Steve McQueen?

155
00:12:23,146 --> 00:12:24,554
Fuck you, it's a set-up.

156
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:27,183
Both Olsen twins.

157
00:12:28,012 --> 00:12:28,606
Ashley.

158
00:12:29,935 --> 00:12:31,328
- Kate.
- Mary-Kate.

159
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:34,066
And yeah, I admire
their body of work.

160
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,473
They're yours.

161
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:37,648
All you gotta do
is name a guy.

162
00:12:41,116 --> 00:12:42,431
I'm not catching,
I'm pitching.

163
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:43,792
No problem.

164
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,533
Cornermen out of the pit.

165
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,621
Release your dogs.

166
00:13:23,742 --> 00:13:25,713
I got that!
Yeah! I got that!

167
00:13:43,675 --> 00:13:45,005
Break your dogs!

168
00:14:05,675 --> 00:14:06,160
Bait...

169
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:45,272
<i>Oh shit, there it is. </i>

170
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:47,650
<i>Can it just be like... </i>

171
00:14:48,265 --> 00:14:50,924
<i>like this unbearable-looking woman?</i>

172
00:14:51,503 --> 00:14:53,823
You know like that old tune
from "The Golden Girls"

173
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:56,134
the short one with
the coke-bottle glasses...

174
00:14:57,783 --> 00:14:58,331
A guy.

175
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:02,774
<i>Hey, yo. </i>

176
00:15:03,494 --> 00:15:03,869
Huh?

177
00:15:04,276 --> 00:15:05,438
Let me ask you a question.

178
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,475
Where do you guys get those hats
with the bills over the ears like that?

179
00:15:09,631 --> 00:15:12,305
I go into all the city stores
and the only ones I can find

180
00:15:12,306 --> 00:15:14,184
are the ones with
the bills in the front.

181
00:15:14,793 --> 00:15:17,806
Naw, it's the same.
Just turn it sideways on your head.

182
00:15:19,742 --> 00:15:21,510
Thanks. Thank you.

183
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:29,556
That's a knucklehead from
the low-rises, right there.

184
00:15:29,665 --> 00:15:30,885
Terrace's spreading out.

185
00:15:32,012 --> 00:15:33,639
They got to go
somewhere, I guess.

186
00:15:39,384 --> 00:15:41,246
Don't think you ought
needed to do that.

187
00:15:43,546 --> 00:15:45,110
He turned cur on me, man...

188
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,335
Nah.

189
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,839
I think you got played.

190
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,788
So, I'm guessin' from the Terrace
being all cute about the property line.

191
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:23,122
<i>I just wanted to wait and see
what you wanted us to do about it. </i>

192
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:27,371
So, what you want us to do?

193
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:29,717
Get back to work.

194
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,673
Alright.

195
00:16:48,063 --> 00:16:50,800
<i>Your boy really jammed me,
that little prick. </i>

196
00:16:51,426 --> 00:16:53,300
<i>It was all over the news. </i>

197
00:16:53,652 --> 00:16:56,781
You did not look particularly
commissioner-like.

198
00:16:56,813 --> 00:16:58,487
Mayor told me the same thing.

199
00:17:00,912 --> 00:17:02,445
You can't have that shit
every week,

200
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:06,204
not if you want His Honor
to give you the job permanent.

201
00:17:07,644 --> 00:17:09,521
Tommy's a good kid, usually.

202
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,821
An asspain when
he wants something,

203
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,667
but mostly good people.

204
00:17:13,862 --> 00:17:15,834
I don't give a shit
what he is.

205
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:18,086
Well, you can't have him
pounding on you, Erv.

206
00:17:19,197 --> 00:17:20,699
Throw him a bone,

207
00:17:22,827 --> 00:17:23,859
he'll take care of you.

208
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:26,676
Alright,

209
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:31,655
but I draw the line at going behind
the Mayor for this guy.

210
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:37,053
You can't sit where I'm sitting
and backdoor the fucking Mayor.

211
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:38,247
Sorry I'm late, guys.

212
00:17:39,514 --> 00:17:41,986
My kid had a little league game.
It started late.

213
00:17:42,221 --> 00:17:43,864
Well, I'll leave
you boys to it.

214
00:17:45,913 --> 00:17:49,981
And what I have brought together,
let no man tear asunder.

215
00:17:53,361 --> 00:17:54,519
- He win?
- Who?

216
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:56,396
Your kid, his team.

217
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,539
Oh shit, who keeps score?

218
00:18:01,941 --> 00:18:03,536
Yeah, it's a little hectic,

219
00:18:03,537 --> 00:18:05,853
but everybody steppin' off
at the right time.

220
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,012
These corner boys
we dealin' with?

221
00:18:08,356 --> 00:18:10,687
I don't think they even
listen to their own people.

222
00:18:10,969 --> 00:18:12,401
Yeah, I'm gonna
talk to peoples.

223
00:18:13,746 --> 00:18:15,890
- Where you at?
- Marlo?

224
00:18:16,641 --> 00:18:17,986
I can't find 'im.

225
00:18:18,753 --> 00:18:22,271
And you told us not to start nothin',
so I set-up in the middle of the block.

226
00:18:23,131 --> 00:18:26,104
You know, even that got hard stares.
I don't know.

227
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,553
It ain't gonna hold, I don't think.

228
00:18:28,686 --> 00:18:29,624
This Marlo.

229
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:31,987
How hard you lookin' for him?

230
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:37,725
Like, why ain't you out there
looking for this motherfucker right now?

231
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,383
'Cause you called
this meeting here.

232
00:18:47,398 --> 00:18:48,305
Shut the door.

233
00:18:52,436 --> 00:18:53,531
What's your good news, man.

234
00:18:53,961 --> 00:18:55,651
Omar right inside the stash.

235
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:59,772
Couple ounces of raw
already vialed, 600.

236
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,181
Cocksuckers even took
my watch.

237
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,248
Second stash this month
they did got to.

238
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:09,034
I mean, he, um,
he called you by name, String.

239
00:19:09,893 --> 00:19:13,288
I mean, all due respect, but
do like unless you step to him.

240
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:14,633
It's gonna be like this.

241
00:19:19,962 --> 00:19:22,481
Alright, man.
Double the muscle on every stash we got.

242
00:19:23,733 --> 00:19:25,141
And if the man comin',

243
00:19:25,939 --> 00:19:27,144
make ready for the man.

244
00:19:27,722 --> 00:19:28,974
It's not personal.

245
00:19:29,522 --> 00:19:32,245
I swear to God,
it's never personal with me.

246
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:37,440
Truth is,

247
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:40,663
I've been a councilman
for almost three years now.

248
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:43,001
And that's a long
fucking time to be ignored.

249
00:19:44,331 --> 00:19:45,426
And this being Baltimore,

250
00:19:45,441 --> 00:19:47,741
a whiteboy doesn't stand
much chance running citywide.

251
00:19:47,773 --> 00:19:50,041
Maybe the legislature,
if the right seat opens up.

252
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:52,544
But until then, I'm stuck
in a job with no power

253
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:54,509
except getting
potholes filled.

254
00:19:56,293 --> 00:19:58,342
All due respect, Councilman,

255
00:19:58,343 --> 00:20:01,800
you're fucking with me because,
what, you're bored?

256
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:03,083
A little, yeah.

257
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:05,528
And what the fuck.

258
00:20:05,544 --> 00:20:07,342
I mean, when it comes
to the crime thing,

259
00:20:07,343 --> 00:20:09,564
this city can use all
the fucking help it can get.

260
00:20:09,596 --> 00:20:11,942
If you're looking for dirt,
there isn't any.

261
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,460
There's always fucking dirt.

262
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:17,219
But right now, I'm just looking to know
how we could do better.

263
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:19,018
You give me that much.

264
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:21,819
I can try and get you
what you need privately.

265
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,072
No hearings, no press,
no grandstanding.

266
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:25,439
And if I don't play ball?

267
00:20:26,081 --> 00:20:27,192
You're gonna have my ass

268
00:20:27,207 --> 00:20:29,539
every time I'm in front
of your committee, right?

269
00:20:34,592 --> 00:20:36,053
One thing comes to mind.

270
00:20:36,491 --> 00:20:36,976
Shoot.

271
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:41,623
I can't get my marked units
back from Dickman Street to save my life.

272
00:20:42,468 --> 00:20:45,237
Cars that are shopped for service
don't come back for weeks.

273
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:46,752
You tell the Mayor?

274
00:20:49,286 --> 00:20:51,117
Not that you heard it from me.

275
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,275
Of course not.

276
00:20:55,676 --> 00:20:57,568
- How much these?
- 10,000 a set.

277
00:21:00,588 --> 00:21:03,232
Nigger show that on a ride,
he hangin' a sign on himself.

278
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,656
Lock my ass up.

279
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,468
No, shit.

280
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:09,105
So how you gonna play it?

281
00:21:10,348 --> 00:21:13,055
If they from the Terrace,
that's Avon.

282
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:14,650
I know.

283
00:21:15,151 --> 00:21:16,512
And Avon, he comin' home, too.

284
00:21:19,173 --> 00:21:22,365
Well, if you inclined to work
something out, that's one thing.

285
00:21:23,257 --> 00:21:23,898
If not?

286
00:21:24,681 --> 00:21:26,229
Avon can seriously handle up.

287
00:21:27,591 --> 00:21:28,175
I know.

288
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:31,805
So if you want to hold onto what's yours,
you best be ready.

289
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:37,677
You remember
that Barksdale kid?

290
00:21:37,724 --> 00:21:39,398
The one who took
all the weight?

291
00:21:40,822 --> 00:21:44,264
Tied his neck to a doorknob
in the prison library and sat his ass down.

292
00:21:45,327 --> 00:21:46,063
I dunno.

293
00:21:47,744 --> 00:21:49,700
Men of color usually don't do themselves.

294
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:54,080
I mean, take me,
for instance...

295
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:56,505
Yeah, I mean.
You got all the reason in the world...

296
00:21:56,521 --> 00:21:59,916
And yet here I am,
still standing.

297
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,027
Give or take.

298
00:22:05,752 --> 00:22:07,583
You looked at
the scene photos?

299
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,168
Nah, there ain't none.

300
00:22:10,173 --> 00:22:11,346
State police dogged it.

301
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,807
My turn, Bunk.

302
00:22:21,856 --> 00:22:24,610
Come on, come on.
Go with number three.

303
00:22:33,431 --> 00:22:34,917
You gonna play
my song, darling?

304
00:22:35,543 --> 00:22:35,903
Huh?

305
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:39,658
- You play the right song...
- Hey, Bunk.

306
00:22:39,689 --> 00:22:41,364
I can make you hit
the high notes, baby.

307
00:22:41,365 --> 00:22:41,819
Hey, Bunk.

308
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,493
Hey, look,
I saw her first, Jimmy...

309
00:22:43,524 --> 00:22:44,807
Bunk, man,
what are you doing?

310
00:22:44,838 --> 00:22:46,434
I got a place
right here in Canmden.

311
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:47,560
Be a gentleman, come on.

312
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:48,828
I'm bein' a gentleman, man.

313
00:22:49,219 --> 00:22:50,877
I'm really
not interested, okay?

314
00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:52,206
Come on, let's go.

315
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:53,552
You're all pink, baby.

316
00:22:54,882 --> 00:22:57,619
I'm really sorry, he's had a bit
too much to drink, you know?

317
00:22:57,651 --> 00:22:59,700
It's okay, thank you, thanks.

318
00:23:01,442 --> 00:23:03,241
- You alright?
- Yeah.

319
00:23:03,977 --> 00:23:05,369
You get yourself home?

320
00:23:06,245 --> 00:23:06,683
Yeah.

321
00:23:08,483 --> 00:23:09,171
Knock it out.

322
00:23:14,906 --> 00:23:16,831
Naw, the baddest nigger
of all time?

323
00:23:16,877 --> 00:23:17,269
Who?

324
00:23:17,316 --> 00:23:19,615
This nigger from New York
from the olden days,

325
00:23:19,647 --> 00:23:21,138
- Bumpy something...
- Bumpy?

326
00:23:21,185 --> 00:23:24,940
Yo, he do shit like, run up
to a police station by himsself.

327
00:23:25,315 --> 00:23:25,706
Nah.

328
00:23:25,847 --> 00:23:28,882
You know what I'm sayin'?
Shit like that. Cops be like hidin', like,

329
00:23:28,898 --> 00:23:33,190
"Yo, Bumpy, we sorry, man, we sorry.
Please go away, please, please!"

330
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:34,989
Woof.

331
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,979
And obtain gainful employment

332
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,217
and refrain from associating
with known criminals,

333
00:23:51,233 --> 00:23:53,392
and keep this office
informed of your residence

334
00:23:53,408 --> 00:23:54,847
and any change in that residence.

335
00:23:54,957 --> 00:23:57,397
So I gather you're not working
at this particular time.

336
00:23:57,538 --> 00:24:00,285
They still doin' the morning
shape-ups down at the market?

337
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:04,039
I don't know and I don't care.
Just get a job, any job.

338
00:24:06,355 --> 00:24:08,545
- "Woof"?
- "Woof", like a dog.

339
00:24:08,936 --> 00:24:10,591
Oh shit, it was like blaow!

340
00:24:11,045 --> 00:24:12,422
It was Cheese's boy, Tri.

341
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,587
So you gonna
hit back or what?

342
00:24:22,976 --> 00:24:24,697
You got a better shot
of the ligature?

343
00:24:24,822 --> 00:24:25,667
Yeah, inside.

344
00:24:33,183 --> 00:24:34,653
What he do,
hang himself twice?

345
00:24:34,966 --> 00:24:38,393
He could have been leaning straight forward
until he blacked out then slid down

346
00:24:38,424 --> 00:24:39,962
which would give you the vertical.

347
00:24:39,993 --> 00:24:42,382
Or how about I come up
at him from behind...

348
00:24:43,764 --> 00:24:46,345
and then set him down, make it
look like goodbye cruel world.

349
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:48,332
What do the scene shots show?

350
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,771
None taken.

351
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:52,513
The troopers really fucked
the pooch on this one.

352
00:24:52,535 --> 00:24:54,256
All I have is some
half-assed report

353
00:24:54,741 --> 00:24:56,900
reads like the investigator
went off his ritalin.

354
00:24:57,792 --> 00:24:59,095
What's a large eckee...

355
00:24:59,127 --> 00:25:01,880
No, large ecchymotic area,
or mid-back.

356
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:03,445
Bruising.

357
00:25:05,072 --> 00:25:06,715
What, mid-back... as in...?

358
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,954
Or he banged himself a few
days earlier in the shower.

359
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:11,547
Yeah, maybe.

360
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:13,784
Nothing like a definite maybe.

361
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:16,522
<i>Tri finally got that m?</i>

362
00:25:16,726 --> 00:25:18,212
<i>Done it on foot too. </i>

363
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,734
Caroline?

364
00:25:20,735 --> 00:25:25,366
<i>Nigger lyin' in chalk but my boy Tri
got the dapple all up his sleeve. </i>

365
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,927
<i>Looks like polka dots. </i>

366
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,571
<i>But that's just something
you got to know from experience,</i>

367
00:25:29,602 --> 00:25:30,963
<i>You know what I'm sayin'?</i>

368
00:25:30,994 --> 00:25:34,343
<i>I even had to school him on the whistle,
still walkin' around with it. </i>

369
00:25:34,921 --> 00:25:38,843
<i>"Yo Tri, stash that shit up at Neesey'S.
What's wrong with you?"</i>

370
00:25:39,628 --> 00:25:42,432
<i>Aw, you know them niggers
is gonna get mad busy over this</i>

371
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:44,029
<i>so we gettin' busy too. </i>

372
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,047
<i>So what time
you comin' over?</i>

373
00:25:46,564 --> 00:25:49,521
<i>Damn, bitch,
ain't you even listenin'?</i>

374
00:25:51,854 --> 00:25:52,762
<i>You still there?</i>

375
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:02,496
Time-out!

376
00:26:12,181 --> 00:26:12,979
Do that again.

377
00:26:13,355 --> 00:26:15,404
- Do what again?
- Do that thing with your hand.

378
00:26:15,436 --> 00:26:16,218
Do it in my face.

379
00:26:16,249 --> 00:26:17,297
Fuck you talkin' about?

380
00:26:23,003 --> 00:26:24,520
Got a lot of room in here.

381
00:26:36,211 --> 00:26:37,307
Fuck the police!

382
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:40,232
Naw, man,
we was just hangin'.

383
00:26:40,764 --> 00:26:41,703
Just slingin'.

384
00:26:42,986 --> 00:26:44,915
How'd you work it out
with the corner crews,

385
00:26:44,946 --> 00:26:47,074
all you guys from the Terrace
coming in like this?

386
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,670
I don't know
what you talkin' about.

387
00:26:48,686 --> 00:26:51,283
Well, you best watch your ass.
'Cause the slingers out here?

388
00:26:51,377 --> 00:26:53,019
They're like the
crack babies' babies.

389
00:26:53,082 --> 00:26:55,375
Man, every year
everybody's like:

390
00:26:55,376 --> 00:26:58,004
"Yeah, these kids out here,
they're a new breed. "

391
00:26:58,286 --> 00:27:00,350
"I ain't never seen
nothing like this before. "

392
00:27:00,351 --> 00:27:01,736
"This the end
of the world now. "

393
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:02,726
Look around, fuckhead.

394
00:27:02,742 --> 00:27:04,823
This seem like the dawn
of a new day to you?

395
00:27:06,043 --> 00:27:07,044
Can I go now?

396
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,501
Or you want to slap me up
some more first.

397
00:27:15,547 --> 00:27:16,799
Get the fuck out of here.

398
00:27:24,746 --> 00:27:25,732
How about a handjob?

399
00:27:26,623 --> 00:27:26,952
Huh?

400
00:27:29,127 --> 00:27:31,684
Aw, man, you don't even get
Weezy Jefferson for a handjob.

401
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,169
Come on.

402
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,911
Dozerman.

403
00:27:33,942 --> 00:27:34,959
Wanna call it a day?

404
00:27:42,281 --> 00:27:43,830
<i>They came back
on us this time. </i>

405
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:45,981
<i>Dazz an' them.
They got Peanut. </i>

406
00:27:46,513 --> 00:27:48,015
<i>Oh, shit, is Peanut dead?</i>

407
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,829
<i>Naw, he's okay. </i>

408
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,818
<i>His brains all over
the sidewalk but he's okay. </i>

409
00:27:53,037 --> 00:27:54,399
<i>What the hell
do you think?</i>

410
00:27:54,618 --> 00:27:57,011
<i>Ah, shit, I gotta call Tony.
I'll get back Atchya. </i>

411
00:27:57,324 --> 00:27:57,950
<i>Alright. </i>

412
00:27:59,396 --> 00:28:00,913
Well, that's two
we heard about.

413
00:28:01,195 --> 00:28:02,728
What the hell's going on?

414
00:28:02,869 --> 00:28:03,933
Drug war maybe?

415
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:05,059
<i>S'up?</i>

416
00:28:06,139 --> 00:28:07,406
<i>Nothing good, man. </i>

417
00:28:08,142 --> 00:28:10,222
<i>I ain't sleep since
I capped his ass. </i>

418
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:15,038
<i>Close my eyes, see him layin'
there all bloody and shit. </i>

419
00:28:15,617 --> 00:28:18,230
<i>Cheese, man,
you did what you had to do. </i>

420
00:28:19,121 --> 00:28:20,659
<i>What I thought I had to do. </i>

421
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,566
That's Cheese?

422
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:23,162
<i>He was my Dawg, yo. </i>

423
00:28:23,538 --> 00:28:25,478
<i>Had much love for me,
even then. </i>

424
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,732
<i>I ain't never gonna find
another Dawg like that... </i>

425
00:28:30,184 --> 00:28:31,842
<i>well, they payin' for it now. </i>

426
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:33,360
<i>Mos' def. </i>

427
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:39,149
For months, these assholes
show perfect phone discipline.

428
00:28:39,743 --> 00:28:41,168
Now, they're
talking up murders?

429
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,390
Cheese is only a level
below Proposition Joe.

430
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:45,800
All of a sudden,
this case has legs.

431
00:28:46,175 --> 00:28:46,883
<i>Homicide... </i>

432
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:48,929
This is Freamon, major-case.

433
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,259
Who's the O.I.C. tonight?

434
00:28:50,494 --> 00:28:51,460
<i>Hold on for Norris. </i>

435
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:54,522
<i>Yo, T., T., Man. <i>

436
00:28:54,819 --> 00:28:55,363
<i>S'up?</i>

437
00:28:55,805 --> 00:28:58,168
<i>I'm shot, I'm shot. </i>

438
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,422
<i>Aw shit, shit,
they comin' back. </i>

439
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:03,857
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

440
00:29:09,974 --> 00:29:10,897
<i>Who this?</i>

441
00:29:11,512 --> 00:29:12,169
<i>Damn. </i>

442
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:14,485
<i>Detective Norris. </i>

443
00:29:14,626 --> 00:29:16,112
Ed, this is Lester.

444
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,380
<i>I hear you're catchin'
bodies on the east side. </i>

445
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,884
You "hear" it?
Like what, "probable cause," hear it?

446
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,892
Like, "I got something
concrete," hear it?

447
00:29:22,939 --> 00:29:24,441
Or just,
"gas up my head," hear it?

448
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:27,601
<i>Like, "I got all the fucking time
in the world to jaw with you," hear it?</i>

449
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:28,994
How many bodies you got, Eddie?

450
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:30,152
"How many you got, Eddie?"

451
00:29:31,047 --> 00:29:31,563
Asshole.

452
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:38,155
- You want me to go up to homicide?
- No, I got it, I got it.

453
00:29:38,201 --> 00:29:40,220
You're the early man
on tomorrow, so go home.

454
00:29:40,235 --> 00:29:40,892
See your kid.

455
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,710
I'm telling you, this kid
Berman's a fucking wizard.

456
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:46,431
I mean check it out, right?

457
00:29:46,776 --> 00:29:48,590
Six reported auto thefts,

458
00:29:49,138 --> 00:29:52,053
two of which state,
"not impossible car was borrowed"

459
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:54,916
making four auto thefts,
with two unfounded.

460
00:29:55,244 --> 00:29:57,654
And the prizewinner?
Four armed robberies,

461
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,724
two of which complainants state,
"too dark to I.D. weapon,

462
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:03,228
not impossible
knife wasn't a com.. "

463
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,371
- He mighta groomed 'em to death.
- Yeah...

464
00:30:05,496 --> 00:30:07,092
Wine into water.

465
00:30:07,968 --> 00:30:09,079
There he is.

466
00:30:09,689 --> 00:30:10,718
Abbadabba Berman.

467
00:30:10,802 --> 00:30:12,194
The Doctor Atkins of crime.

468
00:30:13,148 --> 00:30:14,384
Just doing what I'm told.

469
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,647
God, what a beautiful film.

470
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,227
I couldn't understand a word.

471
00:30:22,258 --> 00:30:23,995
Oh, honey,
you gotta read the subtitles.

472
00:30:24,058 --> 00:30:24,965
Oh shit.

473
00:30:27,234 --> 00:30:28,623
Y'all go to the movies?

474
00:30:31,283 --> 00:30:32,988
And you must be
the lovely Mrs. Herc.

475
00:30:34,537 --> 00:30:35,742
How'd you like your movie?

476
00:30:36,915 --> 00:30:37,604
Okay.

477
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:41,848
Herc and Carver here?
They try to snatch us up everyday like...

478
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:44,195
where the shit, who got the shit...

479
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,526
but they never get nothing.

480
00:30:47,621 --> 00:30:49,136
So y'all go to the movies.

481
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:51,248
Damn.

482
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,456
Alright then. See ya tomorrow.

483
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,810
Is everything okay?

484
00:31:08,596 --> 00:31:09,206
On two.

485
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:11,788
Pick up!

486
00:31:13,634 --> 00:31:14,150
Pick up!

487
00:31:14,197 --> 00:31:16,215
- Ed, you gotta help me.
- I can't, now now.

488
00:31:48,122 --> 00:31:48,435
So.

489
00:31:50,966 --> 00:31:51,419
So?

490
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:55,534
Everything good?

491
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:01,660
How's that fontanette?

492
00:32:04,288 --> 00:32:05,149
Fontanelle.

493
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,110
Is it closing up?

494
00:32:13,213 --> 00:32:14,371
Won't close for a while.

495
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:16,592
Good.

496
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:19,972
Good?

497
00:32:25,812 --> 00:32:27,221
I'm just, I'm just sayin'.

498
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:46,949
Seis hombres, seis dolares.
Seis hombres...

499
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:06,165
<i>I ain't sleep since
I capped his ass. </i>

500
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:11,235
<i>Close my eyes an' see him layin'
there all bloody and shit?</i>

501
00:33:12,596 --> 00:33:15,175
- Cheese.
- Cheese on a platter.

502
00:33:15,738 --> 00:33:17,381
He never talks like that.

503
00:33:18,757 --> 00:33:19,520
Now, why would...

504
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,465
because all good things
come to those who wait.

505
00:33:23,076 --> 00:33:24,124
Does McNulty know?

506
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:25,594
I'll raise his ass.

507
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,953
We'll keep our ears to the wire
keep gathering String, no problem.

508
00:33:30,563 --> 00:33:32,894
But if bodies keep falling
in the Eastern District,

509
00:33:33,441 --> 00:33:35,256
we might have to give up
this wire tap.

510
00:33:39,011 --> 00:33:40,247
Now you comin' around?

511
00:33:41,123 --> 00:33:42,593
Been more than a dam year.

512
00:33:44,721 --> 00:33:46,067
Looks just like his dad, huh?

513
00:33:56,387 --> 00:33:57,122
Let me ask you.

514
00:33:58,472 --> 00:34:00,897
When you heard Dee was
a suicide, what'd you think?

515
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,452
Hey, little fellow.
Come here.

516
00:34:15,823 --> 00:34:18,952
Here's the thing: we got a tip.
And the autopsy report it backs us up.

517
00:34:19,563 --> 00:34:20,971
Can you put him down please?

518
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,259
Sure.

519
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:32,631
You know,
I'm sorry about your loss.

520
00:34:33,569 --> 00:34:36,245
He seemed like a pretty decent
guy, all things considered.

521
00:34:39,937 --> 00:34:41,705
So when I found out about this,

522
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,426
I felt like I owed him...

523
00:34:47,023 --> 00:34:50,731
the last thing I wanted to do was upset you
if there was no point to it, so...

524
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,953
if there's anything I can help with
or any questions you need answered...

525
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:03,518
or whatever.

526
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:17,963
Major, how many people
are under your command?

527
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,844
278, Sir.

528
00:35:20,423 --> 00:35:21,346
278.

529
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,616
And how many felony arrests
they make last month?

530
00:35:26,106 --> 00:35:26,763
Don't bother.

531
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:28,844
You made 16.

532
00:35:29,876 --> 00:35:31,116
16.

533
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:32,818
In a month.

534
00:35:34,554 --> 00:35:36,795
Same time period.
How many handguns you pick up?

535
00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:38,361
All shifts, all sectors...

536
00:35:40,895 --> 00:35:43,085
once again, don't bother.
The answer is none.

537
00:35:44,462 --> 00:35:44,862
None.

538
00:35:46,615 --> 00:35:49,087
You had four bodies last
night in how many hours?

539
00:35:50,276 --> 00:35:52,403
Shut the fucking book,
how many hours?

540
00:35:52,497 --> 00:35:52,967
Seven.

541
00:35:55,933 --> 00:35:56,575
Try five.

542
00:35:59,704 --> 00:36:00,736
Tell me about this kid.

543
00:36:04,632 --> 00:36:06,791
- I believe his name is James...
- James Toney.

544
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,004
When's the last time
he was arrested?

545
00:36:09,676 --> 00:36:10,240
With who?

546
00:36:11,304 --> 00:36:12,208
Where's he sling?

547
00:36:13,854 --> 00:36:14,714
How about this guy?

548
00:36:17,993 --> 00:36:19,714
Or him? Or him?

549
00:36:21,466 --> 00:36:22,202
You know what?

550
00:36:22,217 --> 00:36:24,689
You got four bodies, all within
two blocks of each other

551
00:36:24,736 --> 00:36:27,599
and you can't even start
to connect the fucking dots.

552
00:36:28,476 --> 00:36:31,997
You got eight hours to get a grip
on this mess or you're done. You hear me?

553
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,529
Done.

554
00:37:07,584 --> 00:37:08,054
Marlo?

555
00:37:15,421 --> 00:37:16,813
You know I'm with Avon, right?

556
00:37:18,738 --> 00:37:19,473
Stringer Bell?

557
00:37:23,648 --> 00:37:24,227
Can we talk?

558
00:37:27,544 --> 00:37:30,126
I need you to walk back up
there and pack up your people.

559
00:37:36,408 --> 00:37:38,488
I'm being a gentleman
about it for the moment.

560
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,792
You offer up what you have on this,
you start the clock running on yourselves.

561
00:37:52,933 --> 00:37:54,826
The wiretap has to surface in court.

562
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:56,040
No way around it.

563
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:56,853
She's right.

564
00:37:57,996 --> 00:37:59,795
We finally got something
worth listening to

565
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,766
and you're talking
about giving up the wire?

566
00:38:01,782 --> 00:38:02,501
Makes no sense.

567
00:38:02,517 --> 00:38:03,550
There's a war going on.

568
00:38:04,473 --> 00:38:06,090
We might have
four more bodies tonight.

569
00:38:06,403 --> 00:38:08,077
This is Baltimore,
we might have six.

570
00:38:08,562 --> 00:38:10,485
I watched Marvin Taylor
from the Eastern

571
00:38:10,486 --> 00:38:13,568
get his asshole ripped today
because he has no fucking clue.

572
00:38:13,631 --> 00:38:14,632
I don't believe this.

573
00:38:15,446 --> 00:38:17,391
We got top lieutenants
talking about murders,

574
00:38:17,406 --> 00:38:19,784
and we can't figure out just
to shut up and take notes?

575
00:38:19,816 --> 00:38:22,820
We got bodies on the ground, Jimmy.
That's gotta matter for something.

576
00:38:22,851 --> 00:38:25,234
Look, if we're at Cheese
then we're close to Prop Joe,

577
00:38:25,249 --> 00:38:27,674
and if we're close to Joe,
then we're close to Stringer.

578
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:28,738
That has to matter.

579
00:38:28,785 --> 00:38:32,106
Look, I was right there with you
when we left Stringer on the street

580
00:38:32,107 --> 00:38:33,766
and it grinds me, too.

581
00:38:34,844 --> 00:38:38,631
But the fact is, we didn't create
this unit just to lock up dope dealers.

582
00:38:38,661 --> 00:38:40,726
There's a narcotics unit
downtown for that.

583
00:38:41,117 --> 00:38:43,448
We're about violence.
Have been from the jump.

584
00:38:44,027 --> 00:38:45,482
Barksdale was violent.

585
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:49,394
But right now, Stringer's quiet,
and over on the eastside, we got bodies.

586
00:38:50,215 --> 00:38:54,658
Jimmy, we got enough from the tap
to take a real good shot at Cheese.

587
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,394
You put a murder case
or two together,

588
00:38:56,395 --> 00:38:59,195
you may be able to roll someone up
at Proposition Joe or Stringer.

589
00:38:59,227 --> 00:39:01,221
As far as bodies go,
four's a big number.

590
00:39:05,946 --> 00:39:06,431
Okay then.

591
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:09,717
As of now, we use the phones
to work these murders.

592
00:39:21,762 --> 00:39:26,278
Yo quiero mucho menos
pastillas de secoya en eso.

593
00:39:26,279 --> 00:39:29,595
Y muy mas ancho un poco.

594
00:39:29,924 --> 00:39:30,440
Si?

595
00:39:31,051 --> 00:39:31,661
Gracias.

596
00:39:41,022 --> 00:39:42,337
<i>Yo, we bracin' up, son. </i>

597
00:39:42,493 --> 00:39:42,962
<i>Hanh?</i>

598
00:39:42,994 --> 00:39:45,391
<i>Gather yo'self, nigga.
We gotta bead on Dazz. </i>

599
00:39:45,392 --> 00:39:46,783
<i>Be at Neesey's crib
in a hour. </i>

600
00:39:46,955 --> 00:39:49,278
<i>Dazz be with neesey?
I thought she was your girl. </i>

601
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:50,733
Neesey, huh?
Got it.

602
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:52,704
<i>We just hook up there,
then goin' to battle. </i>

603
00:39:52,751 --> 00:39:54,425
<i>Bring your whistle,
in a hour, one. </i>

604
00:39:56,839 --> 00:39:57,731
Mount up.

605
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:04,488
Caroline, call qrt with
that 20 and stay on the wire.

606
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:06,810
- We're on channel two.
- Alright.

607
00:40:17,825 --> 00:40:19,906
Yo, Tri,
what size fries you want?

608
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,375
What?

609
00:40:21,548 --> 00:40:21,987
Go!

610
00:40:22,362 --> 00:40:27,963
Police! Freeze! Hands up!

611
00:40:32,259 --> 00:40:33,547
<i>Put your hands up!</i>

612
00:40:33,609 --> 00:40:35,757
Put your hands up!
Hands on your head!

613
00:40:38,526 --> 00:40:41,273
Okay, Mary Tyler Moore.
Buck-naked.

614
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:43,250
Open the door, here I come,

615
00:40:44,204 --> 00:40:46,752
drop my attache case down,
bend her over,

616
00:40:47,022 --> 00:40:49,115
give it to her on the ottoman,
and she's like,

617
00:40:49,143 --> 00:40:51,321
"Oh Rob, oh Rob... "

618
00:40:52,047 --> 00:40:52,587
Who's Rob?

619
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,278
From the show. Done.

620
00:40:55,975 --> 00:40:58,523
Mary-Kate and Ashley...
I don't want to say.

621
00:40:58,552 --> 00:41:01,029
Just accept whatever pictures
are on my mind right now.

622
00:41:01,171 --> 00:41:01,954
Anybody else?

623
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:05,213
Yeah, Dozerman's girl,
what's her name?

624
00:41:05,825 --> 00:41:07,092
She's baking a cake.

625
00:41:07,605 --> 00:41:08,331
Naked.

626
00:41:08,729 --> 00:41:11,690
White flour splotches all
over her fine brown skin.

627
00:41:12,202 --> 00:41:14,971
I come in, in a chef's hat,
nothing else on,

628
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:19,655
johnson out to here and say,
"that's no way to stir a batter.

629
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,317
Here, let me try to get... "
Hey, Doze,

630
00:41:23,641 --> 00:41:24,310
what's up?

631
00:41:24,695 --> 00:41:25,791
Done, now the guy.

632
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,791
This is a hard one for
anybody to understand.

633
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,240
I mean it's got
nothing to do with sex.

634
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,300
It's about... sympathy.

635
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:38,307
- It's about giving a guy a break.
- Yeah, okay, okay.

636
00:41:41,524 --> 00:41:42,520
Gus Triandos.

637
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,278
Who's Gus Triandos?

638
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,639
A catcher with the Orioles
back in the day.

639
00:41:49,023 --> 00:41:50,518
Me and my brother had his card,

640
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,695
sorry lookin' motherfucker, man.

641
00:41:52,696 --> 00:41:54,603
I mean, he looked
like this little kid

642
00:41:54,617 --> 00:41:57,237
who got left at a bus station
by his parents.

643
00:41:58,507 --> 00:41:59,333
You know why?

644
00:42:00,813 --> 00:42:03,019
Because he had to catch Hoyt
Wilhelm's knuckle ball.

645
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:06,379
Five fucking years,
the worst gig in baseball.

646
00:42:06,664 --> 00:42:09,054
It was like trying to catch
a greased pig with wings.

647
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:12,470
He even told a reporter once
"Wilhelm nearly ruined me. "

648
00:42:13,623 --> 00:42:14,776
Gus Triandos.

649
00:42:15,488 --> 00:42:16,698
Big slow guy.

650
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,412
- Good choice.
- Go ahead, say it.

651
00:42:20,252 --> 00:42:22,971
- I know you want to say it.
- Say what? There's nothing to say.

652
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:25,220
- Nothing?
- You put a lot of thought into it.

653
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:26,124
It's cool.

654
00:42:26,636 --> 00:42:27,020
Okay.

655
00:42:29,141 --> 00:42:29,725
Okay.

656
00:42:30,109 --> 00:42:31,813
Tonight, three things.

657
00:42:32,112 --> 00:42:32,781
Number one.

658
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:36,852
Keep your incident numbers sequential
or it's gonna be a stone mess tomorrow.

659
00:42:37,265 --> 00:42:38,062
Number two.

660
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,453
We'll be photographing
evidence at the scene.

661
00:42:41,087 --> 00:42:44,845
That means don't bag anything
until you get the shot off.

662
00:42:45,642 --> 00:42:46,595
And number three,

663
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,503
don't embarrass yourselves...

664
00:42:50,866 --> 00:42:52,922
make sure your camera's
loaded with film.

665
00:42:54,289 --> 00:42:55,314
Okay, mount up.

666
00:42:58,019 --> 00:42:58,944
So Cheese,

667
00:42:59,513 --> 00:43:00,353
who's your Dawg?

668
00:43:01,896 --> 00:43:02,778
You my Dawg.

669
00:43:05,013 --> 00:43:07,276
I just wanna know
who's your Dawg, Dawg.

670
00:43:07,803 --> 00:43:09,739
What's this some psychology, huh?

671
00:43:10,664 --> 00:43:15,567
Yeah, okay, uh, "yo, please stop, stop.
I'll tell you everything I know. "

672
00:43:16,254 --> 00:43:17,834
C'mon, Cheese.

673
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,139
Who's your Dawg?

674
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:28,271
Aw, hell no.
You ain't layin' no bodies on me, man.

675
00:43:28,385 --> 00:43:29,353
Lawyer time.

676
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:32,006
"He was my Dawg, man. "

677
00:43:33,686 --> 00:43:35,764
"I ain't sleep since
I capped his ass. "

678
00:43:36,184 --> 00:43:39,842
"Lookin' up at me
all bloody and shit?"

679
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:44,034
"Had much love for me
even then. "

680
00:43:45,016 --> 00:43:47,080
"I ain't never
gonna find another... "

681
00:43:51,859 --> 00:43:53,994
Man, you all some
cold-ass motherfuckers, man.

682
00:43:56,343 --> 00:43:57,268
We got you on tape.

683
00:44:02,893 --> 00:44:03,975
So what happen, Cheese?

684
00:44:07,235 --> 00:44:09,956
I thought he punked me, alright?
So I did what I had to do.

685
00:44:11,241 --> 00:44:12,110
Which was...

686
00:44:13,462 --> 00:44:14,184
Lit him up.

687
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:19,750
Well, he's talking anyway.

688
00:44:24,707 --> 00:44:26,002
Well, what's done is done.

689
00:44:27,724 --> 00:44:29,219
But, maybe we can
help you on this.

690
00:44:30,571 --> 00:44:30,927
How?

691
00:44:31,411 --> 00:44:32,649
You gonna bring him back?

692
00:44:33,048 --> 00:44:34,628
No, on the consequences.

693
00:44:35,155 --> 00:44:36,222
Help us help you.

694
00:44:37,176 --> 00:44:38,842
- What?
- Maybe we can trade up.

695
00:44:39,895 --> 00:44:42,400
Trade up for what, man?
For this?

696
00:44:42,614 --> 00:44:44,308
- The fuck...
- Proposition Joe.

697
00:44:45,703 --> 00:44:46,980
You give us Prop Joe and maybe

698
00:44:47,008 --> 00:44:49,257
we look at this whole thing
with Dawg differently.

699
00:44:49,713 --> 00:44:52,688
Now, why would I be talkin'
about Prop Joe behind...

700
00:44:53,272 --> 00:44:55,919
You know what, man?
I don't even know no Prop Joe.

701
00:44:56,754 --> 00:44:58,348
Okay, Dawg...

702
00:44:59,487 --> 00:45:01,380
which one of these is he?
Where's that body?

703
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:03,971
Where I left it most likely.

704
00:45:04,925 --> 00:45:07,046
- Warehouse on the east side.
- And he still there?

705
00:45:07,776 --> 00:45:10,723
Far's I know.
'Less the SPCA come around.

706
00:45:14,162 --> 00:45:14,537
What?

707
00:45:16,164 --> 00:45:17,369
Looks like they broke him.

708
00:45:19,168 --> 00:45:22,094
I got to say.
You really showed me something on this.

709
00:45:26,526 --> 00:45:30,109
What can I possibly add to that
except I owe you one, Cedric.

710
00:45:38,843 --> 00:45:42,034
You ever have one of those
have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too days?

711
00:45:43,286 --> 00:45:44,725
I believe this could be my first.

712
00:45:49,255 --> 00:45:50,397
Tell me something good.

713
00:45:51,617 --> 00:45:52,556
We're charging him.

714
00:45:52,994 --> 00:45:56,843
Improper disposal of an animal.
Discharging a firearm in city limits.

715
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:59,380
Animal cruelty, if you
wanna run wild with it.

716
00:46:05,544 --> 00:46:07,406
Go ahead.
Call me a cocksucker.

717
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,132
- You know you wanna.
- Excuse me?

718
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:13,981
You know, I actually looked up
the stats on Gus Triandos.

719
00:46:14,623 --> 00:46:15,608
Power hitter, right?

720
00:46:18,628 --> 00:46:19,754
Fuck the both of you.

721
00:46:34,414 --> 00:46:35,415
Later, dawg.

722
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:37,293
Kiss my ass.

723
00:46:40,437 --> 00:46:41,095
Night, Bunk.

724
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:45,603
Funny day...

725
00:46:47,637 --> 00:46:50,344
I'm the new departmental pet
for shutting down a drug war,

726
00:46:51,689 --> 00:46:53,727
but I blew my wire
for a dead terrier.

727
00:46:59,845 --> 00:47:04,847
You remember how you said you
hoped today would be your first

728
00:47:05,832 --> 00:47:07,851
have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too day?

729
00:47:09,384 --> 00:47:10,276
What about it?

730
00:47:36,361 --> 00:47:37,503
Okay, gents.

731
00:47:37,534 --> 00:47:41,430
You see the brake lights pump twice,
you know we got a clean hand-to-hand.

732
00:47:46,279 --> 00:47:51,035
So I get in this morning and I'm
looking at three phone messages

733
00:47:51,082 --> 00:47:52,866
from Buddy Ferraro over at D.P.W.

734
00:47:53,586 --> 00:47:57,493
All assuring me that I'll have
20 radio cars back in service

735
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,746
at the end of the week.

736
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,293
Buddy and my old man go way back.

737
00:48:02,247 --> 00:48:04,656
Made their first communion
together at St. Leo's.

738
00:48:08,933 --> 00:48:09,450
So...

739
00:48:11,405 --> 00:48:12,485
what else do you need?

740
00:48:13,752 --> 00:48:15,645
You didn't go to
the Mayor with it?

741
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:17,147
Did you get your cars?

742
00:48:18,242 --> 00:48:19,728
Did anyone get fucked over it?

743
00:48:19,744 --> 00:48:21,903
Or did your job
just get a little easier?

744
00:48:27,073 --> 00:48:29,983
I got 70 cops retiring
at the end of the year.

745
00:48:30,015 --> 00:48:34,004
That I know of and no money for
an academy class.

746
00:48:34,009 --> 00:48:37,201
The Mayor fucked you 'cause
I know that money was in the budget.

747
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:39,908
The Mayor delayed it
till next summer.

748
00:48:40,238 --> 00:48:42,929
Less troops, less salary,
less bennies.

749
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:47,811
Even a six-month delay saves the city
two, three million.

750
00:48:48,452 --> 00:48:49,719
Lemme talk to some people.

751
00:49:59,301 --> 00:49:59,739
Yeah.

752
00:50:00,803 --> 00:50:01,582
<i>Major Colvin?</i>

753
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:01,898
Yeah.

754
00:50:04,934 --> 00:50:06,471
<i>I'm sorry to call you this late,</i>

755
00:50:06,472 --> 00:50:08,867
<i>but we have an officer
down in your district. </i>

756
00:50:11,494 --> 00:50:12,370
Which hospital?

757
00:50:19,654 --> 00:50:22,345
I, ah, just got the lease, so...

758
00:50:34,352 --> 00:50:35,995
Fucking solo cars!

759
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,283
I shoulda teamed him.
I fucked up.

760
00:50:38,737 --> 00:50:40,035
Dead-ass motherfucker's dead.

761
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,196
We catch up to him,
he don't come in alive.

762
00:50:45,261 --> 00:50:45,652
Right?

763
00:50:56,716 --> 00:50:59,165
Nicked jugular, shattered jaw.

764
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:02,107
He'll live.

765
00:51:10,758 --> 00:51:12,134
Hand me one of those.

766
00:51:17,219 --> 00:51:19,191
I just got back
from shock-trauma.

767
00:51:20,917 --> 00:51:23,843
You guys saved his ass getting
him down as fast as you did.

768
00:51:25,626 --> 00:51:26,988
So what we got for a suspect?

769
00:51:28,067 --> 00:51:31,898
Number one male, white t-shirt.
Baggy jeans, tennis shoes.

770
00:51:32,108 --> 00:51:34,799
In the wind, but we're
locking it down out there.

771
00:51:36,379 --> 00:51:38,100
So what's this
I hear about the gun?

772
00:51:40,337 --> 00:51:42,543
Doze tried to return fire,
he dropped his piece.

773
00:51:42,575 --> 00:51:45,015
Some fuck picks it up and books.

774
00:51:45,829 --> 00:51:47,268
I mean I can't
believe this shit.

775
00:51:50,356 --> 00:51:51,467
I'll take it.

776
00:51:59,539 --> 00:52:00,869
No, no, no...

777
00:52:34,904 --> 00:52:36,860
It'll be nicer when
I fix the place up.

778
00:52:37,971 --> 00:52:39,034
Cedric...

779
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:41,366
I don't care.

780
00:52:52,543 --> 00:52:53,671
No, tell him I'm cooked.

781
00:52:53,702 --> 00:52:55,627
I just got done at
the hospital, I'm all in.

782
00:52:55,642 --> 00:52:58,193
<i>Well, he was askin' if you could
maybe talk to the reporters. </i>

783
00:52:58,224 --> 00:53:00,461
He doesn't want me talking
to reporters right now.

784
00:53:00,492 --> 00:53:00,868
<i>Alright. </i>

785
00:53:00,884 --> 00:53:02,370
That would truly be unwise.

786
00:53:02,401 --> 00:53:03,808
<i>Alright, alright,
I'll tell him. </i>

787
00:53:03,829 --> 00:53:04,267
Alright.

788
00:53:08,241 --> 00:53:08,648
Bunny.

789
00:53:09,368 --> 00:53:10,510
You look hellacious.

790
00:53:12,101 --> 00:53:13,478
You got coffee going in there?

791
00:53:16,169 --> 00:53:17,452
You know what I was thinking?

792
00:53:19,094 --> 00:53:20,221
Tonight's a good night.

793
00:53:21,238 --> 00:53:21,754
Why?

794
00:53:23,053 --> 00:53:24,490
Because my shot cop didn't die.

795
00:53:27,557 --> 00:53:28,292
And it hit me...

796
00:53:30,795 --> 00:53:32,845
this is what makes
a good night on my watch:

797
00:53:34,018 --> 00:53:35,268
Absence of a negative.

798
00:53:36,347 --> 00:53:37,364
That was a good night.

799
00:53:39,586 --> 00:53:40,321
Here's the thing.

800
00:53:42,668 --> 00:53:43,685
Six months from now?

801
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:44,968
I'm gone.

802
00:53:47,026 --> 00:53:48,137
I put in my 30

803
00:53:48,935 --> 00:53:51,657
and the only thing that'll be left of me
on that job is an

804
00:53:52,204 --> 00:53:54,739
eight-by-eleven framed picture
in the western hallway.

805
00:53:56,675 --> 00:53:57,567
But you know what?

806
00:53:58,975 --> 00:54:00,008
The shit out there,

807
00:54:01,729 --> 00:54:02,496
the city,

808
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,889
is worse than
when I first came on.

809
00:54:06,423 --> 00:54:08,113
So what does that say about me?

810
00:54:10,882 --> 00:54:11,805
About my life...

811
00:54:13,229 --> 00:54:15,278
Aw, c'mon, man.
You're talking about drugs.

812
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:17,907
That's a force of nature.

813
00:54:18,204 --> 00:54:21,177
That's sweeping leaves on a windy day
whoever the hell you are.

814
00:54:22,428 --> 00:54:23,856
You fought the good fight...

815
00:54:38,178 --> 00:54:40,402
Not a call since
we gave it up to Cheese.

816
00:54:41,406 --> 00:54:42,376
What did you expect?

817
00:54:45,646 --> 00:54:46,287
<i>Attention. </i>

818
00:54:57,811 --> 00:54:58,390
Be seated.

819
00:55:06,643 --> 00:55:08,161
Regarding officer Dozerman,

820
00:55:09,835 --> 00:55:12,640
His condition has been
upgraded to guarded.

821
00:55:14,283 --> 00:55:15,769
'Till he can receive visits,

822
00:55:16,364 --> 00:55:17,944
he's beemoved to the recovery unit.

823
00:55:20,416 --> 00:55:21,560
As of this tour,

824
00:55:22,718 --> 00:55:26,035
all hand-to-hand
undercover buys of C.D.S.

825
00:55:27,067 --> 00:55:28,757
Are suspended
in the Western District.

826
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:34,820
Somewheres

827
00:55:36,557 --> 00:55:37,855
back in the dawn of time

828
00:55:39,905 --> 00:55:42,032
this district had
itself a civic dilemma

829
00:55:42,658 --> 00:55:43,578
of epic proportions.

830
00:55:45,643 --> 00:55:47,536
The city council
had just passed a law

831
00:55:47,568 --> 00:55:51,150
that forbid alcoholic
consumption in public places.

832
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:52,892
On the streets

833
00:55:54,128 --> 00:55:55,129
and on the corners.

834
00:55:57,006 --> 00:56:00,526
But the corner is, and it was
and it always will be

835
00:56:01,622 --> 00:56:02,654
the poor man's lounge.

836
00:56:03,792 --> 00:56:06,201
It's where a man wants to be
on a hot summer's night.

837
00:56:06,608 --> 00:56:07,875
It's cheaper than a bar,

838
00:56:08,313 --> 00:56:10,378
catch a nice breeze,
watch the girls go by.

839
00:56:11,974 --> 00:56:14,352
But the law's the law

840
00:56:15,702 --> 00:56:17,157
and the western cops rollin' by,

841
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,129
what were they gonna do?

842
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:23,232
If they arrested every dude out there
for tipping back a high life

843
00:56:23,248 --> 00:56:26,080
there'd be no other time
for any other kind of police work.

844
00:56:26,831 --> 00:56:28,473
And if they looked
the other way?

845
00:56:29,396 --> 00:56:32,901
They'd open themselves
to all kinds of flaunting,

846
00:56:34,329 --> 00:56:35,549
all kinds of disrespect.

847
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:41,804
Now, this is before
my time when it happened but,

848
00:56:43,196 --> 00:56:45,652
somewheres back
in the 50s or 60s,

849
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,594
there was a small moment of

850
00:56:49,282 --> 00:56:52,133
goddamn genius by some
nameless smokehound

851
00:56:52,134 --> 00:56:54,069
who comes out
the cut-rate one day

852
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:56,280
and on his way to the corner,

853
00:56:57,235 --> 00:56:59,722
he slips that just-bought
pint of Elderberry

854
00:57:01,607 --> 00:57:02,468
into a paper bag.

855
00:57:04,439 --> 00:57:07,991
A great moment
of civic compromise.

856
00:57:08,773 --> 00:57:11,621
That small wrinkled-ass paper bag

857
00:57:12,486 --> 00:57:15,083
allowed the corner boys
to have their drink in peace

858
00:57:16,585 --> 00:57:18,071
and gave us permission

859
00:57:19,276 --> 00:57:22,017
to go and do police work.

860
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,368
The kind of police work
that's actually worth the effort,

861
00:57:29,918 --> 00:57:33,437
that's worth actually
taking a bullet for.

862
00:57:36,379 --> 00:57:37,270
Dozerman,

863
00:57:38,491 --> 00:57:40,399
he got shot last night
trying to buy...

864
00:57:40,994 --> 00:57:41,849
three vials.

865
00:57:43,067 --> 00:57:43,677
Three!

866
00:57:53,987 --> 00:57:55,723
There's never been a paper bag...

867
00:57:57,003 --> 00:57:57,879
for drugs.

868
00:58:06,506 --> 00:58:07,382
Until now.

869
00:58:15,549 --> 00:58:17,989
If we ain't doing hand-to-hands,
then what the fuck?

870
00:58:19,804 --> 00:58:21,212
