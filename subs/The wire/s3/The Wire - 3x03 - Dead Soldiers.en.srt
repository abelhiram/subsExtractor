1
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,533
I gotta hit the head.

2
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:23,478
I can't take
this shit, Bunny.

3
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:25,015
Hey

4
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:26,962
It'll pass.

5
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:30,405
They're just
riding you now.

6
00:02:30,587 --> 00:02:32,440
Next week it's somebody new.

7
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:35,101
Can't take away
your E.O.D., Marvin.

8
00:02:36,462 --> 00:02:39,148
Worst they can do is bust
you back to lieutenant.

9
00:02:40,415 --> 00:02:41,974
I don't even
wanna think about

10
00:02:41,975 --> 00:02:43,723
the worst these
motherfuckers can do.

11
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:46,066
You don't either.

12
00:02:50,828 --> 00:02:53,362
You're still not connecting
the dots, Marvin.

13
00:02:55,473 --> 00:02:56,613
Have a look.

14
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,306
Hoffman and Holbrook, Sir.

15
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:01,420
Very good.

16
00:03:02,077 --> 00:03:03,704
You had a body drop
there last week

17
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:06,027
and this is what the fuck
it looked like yesterday.

18
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:08,044
Bond and Preston

19
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:09,687
for the record.

20
00:03:11,293 --> 00:03:12,313
Ashland and Wolfe.

21
00:03:14,272 --> 00:03:15,293
Chase and Durham.

22
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:20,149
Sir, I deployed my resources
per your instructions.

23
00:03:20,513 --> 00:03:21,909
We beefed up foot patrols.

24
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,300
We have our plainclothes
squads on 12-hour shifts.

25
00:03:25,704 --> 00:03:26,994
And the corners stay full?

26
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:28,296
They move, Sir.

27
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:29,861
Everyday

28
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,493
they're gonna
sell their drugs somewhere.

29
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:33,725
Major Taylor.

30
00:03:34,546 --> 00:03:37,854
I look at your numbers, I see
the intel reports, the photos.

31
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,402
It all tells me
that you lack a fucking clue.

32
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,466
If you'll permit me.

33
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:47,622
Is your Deputy Major present?

34
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:49,240
Yes, Sir.

35
00:03:52,461 --> 00:03:54,654
You now command
the Eastern District.

36
00:03:55,686 --> 00:03:57,528
Major Taylor,
you are relieved.

37
00:03:58,537 --> 00:03:59,487
Take the podium.

38
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:12,848
Anyone else having trouble
with the writing on the wall?

39
00:04:14,062 --> 00:04:14,836
Dismissed.

40
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:49,065
Dead Soldiers

41
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,129
And I'm like "nigger if you want
to sell me a new car

42
00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,983
you better really sell it to me

43
00:06:00,006 --> 00:06:03,220
'cause otherwise, I'm sittin'
back and I'm watchin'."

44
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:05,071
What you want
with a new ride for?

45
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,277
It ain't like you
can't get a new car

46
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,681
anywhere you want,
anytime, this whole city.

47
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,699
- I'm just sayin'.
- Sayin' what?

48
00:06:11,922 --> 00:06:13,705
- In case.
- In case what?

49
00:06:14,068 --> 00:06:16,531
In case I ever want
to buy a new car.

50
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:18,760
Damn, is that too
much to ask for?

51
00:06:19,323 --> 00:06:20,379
Girl, you crazy.

52
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:22,443
Shit, shit,
Get down. Get down.

53
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:45,595
Yeah, they filling it now.

54
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,870
They protectin'
the fuck out of it, too.

55
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:50,032
You see what you wanted?

56
00:06:51,158 --> 00:06:51,703
Yeah, man.

57
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:54,508
But they got the whole
second floor boarded up.

58
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:55,944
Got a little
porch 'round back.

59
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,478
Couple of the boys out there
now smoking on them menthols.

60
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,153
So we slide up from the back?

61
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:02,815
It barred up, too.

62
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,739
No way through the front?

63
00:07:04,997 --> 00:07:05,742
Not now.

64
00:07:06,147 --> 00:07:08,402
Come tomorrow morning
they gonna scale back down

65
00:07:08,425 --> 00:07:10,349
to a three-man skeleton crew,
ya feel me?

66
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,108
Not sure I like this.

67
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:16,484
Why we gotta keep hitting up
the Barksdale people?

68
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:18,489
Ain't like this whole
motherfuckin' city

69
00:07:18,513 --> 00:07:19,885
ain't got stashes all over it.

70
00:07:20,402 --> 00:07:21,119
True that.

71
00:07:21,928 --> 00:07:22,709
So why?

72
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:26,315
Because.

73
00:07:27,353 --> 00:07:28,133
Because?

74
00:07:29,846 --> 00:07:30,549
Indeed.

75
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:40,281
So that's a cop shooter?

76
00:07:41,431 --> 00:07:42,803
Yeah, not much to him

77
00:07:43,859 --> 00:07:46,146
but he did the job on
the Dozerman kid last week.

78
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:47,765
We gave it up
in a full statement.

79
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:50,157
Before or after you knocked
the shit out of him?

80
00:07:53,604 --> 00:07:56,338
Injuries were sustained while
patrol officers were effecting

81
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:59,493
pursuit and rest
of aforementioned suspect.

82
00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:01,710
He was caught
Eastside, right?

83
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:04,648
But the wagon made
a stop at the Western District

84
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:06,313
for an unscheduled tune-up.

85
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:09,457
It's dark on that backlot.

86
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:13,173
Western boys mistook
him for a pinata.

87
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:16,129
So what do you think?

88
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:19,777
I think this is a tragic motherfuckin'
miscarriage of justice.

89
00:08:20,622 --> 00:08:23,035
I think it deserves
a special grand jury

90
00:08:23,058 --> 00:08:25,029
and if not, the president
should appoint

91
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,226
an independent prosecutor.

92
00:08:26,296 --> 00:08:27,833
Oh, no, no, no, actually

93
00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:31,399
I think Kofi Bryant
an' the United fucking Nations

94
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,511
should get involved.

95
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,954
It's a murder, Bunk.

96
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,157
The word from upstairs is that
we supposed to be havin'

97
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:38,154
less murders, not more.

98
00:08:38,177 --> 00:08:40,981
This is Anne Arundel county.
Why should they care about that?

99
00:08:41,032 --> 00:08:41,806
Why should you?

100
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,402
Hey, Bunk.
Hey, how's it going?

101
00:08:43,754 --> 00:08:45,361
Listen, um, Deputy
wants to know.

102
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:47,390
Have we recovered
Dozerman's service weapon?

103
00:08:47,425 --> 00:08:49,548
No, Sir. The kid says he sold
it on the street.

104
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:51,284
Gave only the street
name of the buyer.

105
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:53,196
A certain Peanut,
whereabouts unknown.

106
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:54,322
They want that gun back.

107
00:08:55,061 --> 00:08:55,519
Sir?

108
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:58,252
They don't want to have a departmental
weapon on the street.

109
00:08:58,275 --> 00:08:59,378
You know, as a principle.

110
00:09:00,656 --> 00:09:02,275
The great white
deputy has spoken.

111
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,826
This case is not down
until the gun comes home.

112
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:06,621
Fine, don't get up.

113
00:09:07,712 --> 00:09:10,492
One of the most heavily armed
cities in the gun-loving world,

114
00:09:10,515 --> 00:09:12,350
why should those
ignorant motherfuckers

115
00:09:12,368 --> 00:09:14,757
care about one got-damn
semiauto, more or less?

116
00:09:25,818 --> 00:09:28,152
What'd you bring me downtown
in this shit for, man?

117
00:09:28,187 --> 00:09:29,302
Police don't get whif.

118
00:09:32,856 --> 00:09:34,005
Talk to me, big man.

119
00:09:34,393 --> 00:09:36,235
Thought you should know,
my boy Cheese,

120
00:09:36,305 --> 00:09:38,440
he went into the box
with a couple of police.

121
00:09:39,015 --> 00:09:39,771
He stood tall?

122
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:40,727
No doubt.

123
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:42,604
Kept his mouth shut
and waited 'em out.

124
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:46,573
Way it turned out,
they the ones that fucked up.

125
00:09:47,523 --> 00:09:48,028
How come?

126
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,195
Police let it slip
Cheese played in some talkies.

127
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:53,236
Tried to pin a hit on him.

128
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:55,030
Said they had it all over.

129
00:09:55,699 --> 00:09:56,497
Who got hit?

130
00:09:56,982 --> 00:09:57,769
A dog.

131
00:09:58,543 --> 00:09:59,246
What kinda dog?

132
00:09:59,938 --> 00:10:01,850
Kind mistake
your leg for pussy.

133
00:10:05,757 --> 00:10:07,900
So, they had phones tapped?

134
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:11,138
Don't matter to me
none if they did.

135
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:15,231
Me and the people I keep close,
we don't talk on the phone none.

136
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:17,683
You talk on the phone, String?

137
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:20,052
So we good then.

138
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:23,466
What we know is they
still looking hard at us.

139
00:10:25,894 --> 00:10:28,823
You wanna know what kills more
police than bullets and liquor?

140
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:30,648
Boredom.

141
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:32,823
They jus' can't
handle that shit.

142
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:36,362
You keep it boring, String.

143
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,708
You keep it dead
fucking boring.

144
00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:50,592
You're serious?

145
00:10:51,842 --> 00:10:52,581
I am.

146
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,337
What's the closest
school to here?

147
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:56,323
Stuart Hill elementary.

148
00:10:57,507 --> 00:10:58,821
That's at least eight blocks.

149
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,571
Three sevens.

150
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:07,885
Three sevens?

151
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:10,571
Five eights.

152
00:11:12,718 --> 00:11:13,750
Bullshit, let's see it.

153
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:15,311
Five eights.

154
00:11:15,568 --> 00:11:16,366
Read 'em an' weep.

155
00:11:17,246 --> 00:11:18,032
You're cheating.

156
00:11:18,536 --> 00:11:20,120
I just can't catch
your ass is all.

157
00:11:20,155 --> 00:11:21,181
It's just luck, Tony.

158
00:11:21,826 --> 00:11:22,588
It's just luck.

159
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:25,169
You called my desk
looking for me?

160
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:26,412
Yes, I did, come on in.

161
00:11:26,506 --> 00:11:27,304
Grab a chair.

162
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:29,034
But watch your
wallet if you do.

163
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:32,061
Make it quick, Tommy.

164
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:33,867
The new city editor wants

165
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:36,143
a 40-inch weekender
on liquor board reform.

166
00:11:36,448 --> 00:11:38,290
They're going to reform
the liquor board?

167
00:11:38,313 --> 00:11:39,627
Yeah, with a hand grenade.

168
00:11:42,956 --> 00:11:44,046
So what's on your mind?

169
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,709
We're off the record?

170
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:50,744
There's going to be
no academy class

171
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:51,976
of police cadets this year.

172
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:52,856
Mayor's orders.

173
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,791
Homicide rate's climbing,
felonies are up

174
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:57,704
we got patrol
vacancies out the ass.

175
00:11:58,115 --> 00:12:00,262
Even more coming
at the year-end retirements.

176
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,185
And this is coming
from his honor?

177
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:03,265
To what end?

178
00:12:03,628 --> 00:12:04,569
Keep some money.

179
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:07,325
Money's in the budget,
but even a six-month delay

180
00:12:07,349 --> 00:12:08,921
in hiring saves
a couple million.

181
00:12:09,202 --> 00:12:11,830
You think there's some paper,
something the Mayor signed?

182
00:12:11,853 --> 00:12:13,613
Nah, but you call
the personnel office

183
00:12:13,621 --> 00:12:16,366
and they'll confirm that
the class is delayed until next year.

184
00:12:16,378 --> 00:12:17,351
You get that much

185
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:19,738
you can come back to me
for a couple of quotes.

186
00:12:21,445 --> 00:12:22,419
You want in on this?

187
00:12:22,665 --> 00:12:23,427
No indeed.

188
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:25,149
I love my mayor.

189
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:26,334
Councilman, thank you.

190
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:30,463
Stirring up some shit.

191
00:12:30,674 --> 00:12:31,589
Just a little bit.

192
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:34,252
For the good of our
fair city by the bay.

193
00:12:36,663 --> 00:12:37,555
Three twos.

194
00:12:43,572 --> 00:12:46,266
Housing authority has this
slated for demolition, right?

195
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,190
But no money to do it yet.

196
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:51,005
Boss, you sure
it's a good idea

197
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:52,906
not to tell anyone
about this downtown?

198
00:12:53,246 --> 00:12:54,953
Ignorance is bliss,
Lieutenant.

199
00:12:55,587 --> 00:12:56,854
Anyone ever tell you that?

200
00:12:57,288 --> 00:13:00,150
Once, but I beat the dog-piss
out of the guy with a nightstick.

201
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:03,012
Anybody seen McNulty?

202
00:13:05,382 --> 00:13:06,673
Catch him up when he posts.

203
00:13:08,256 --> 00:13:09,013
New target.

204
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:10,462
Kintel Williamson

205
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:12,174
goes by Prince K.

206
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,623
Has a string of corners from
Park Circle to Woodland Avenue.

207
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,519
And he's dropping bodies, too.

208
00:13:18,106 --> 00:13:19,631
Three in the last four months

209
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:22,047
or so say our friends
in the Northwestern District.

210
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,334
So we're off
Proposition Joe's people?

211
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,253
We're going to ship the mid-level
arrests downtown to C.I.D.

212
00:13:27,451 --> 00:13:29,316
Let narcotics work
up those prosecutions.

213
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,134
After that, we're
on to new business.

214
00:13:32,038 --> 00:13:33,222
He don't look like much.

215
00:13:33,598 --> 00:13:34,665
He's dropping bodies.

216
00:13:35,251 --> 00:13:37,867
And with everybody pressed
to bring the murder rate down

217
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:39,662
that's the new mandate
for this unit.

218
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:41,281
Bell has bodies on him, too.

219
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,132
Not lately.

220
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,776
And Prop Joe hasn't
made much noise either.

221
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,687
They're still running product.

222
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,634
Still got kids
banging out there.

223
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:51,802
And now, 'cause we blew
a wire over a fucking dog

224
00:13:52,107 --> 00:13:53,819
we have to let
them just walk on

225
00:13:54,218 --> 00:13:56,329
go about their shit
like we were never anything

226
00:13:56,353 --> 00:13:58,080
to take seriously
in the first place?

227
00:14:09,987 --> 00:14:12,802
I want an investigative strategy
mapped out by week's end.

228
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:19,998
McNulty's here
in spirit anyway.

229
00:14:21,887 --> 00:14:22,456
What?

230
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:48,420
Right there.

231
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,949
This will work, too.

232
00:15:44,338 --> 00:15:47,294
There's a couple
occupied in the 200 block

233
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:49,159
and that one over there

234
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,089
but, otherwise...

235
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:55,870
we're good.

236
00:15:58,592 --> 00:16:00,879
Good shit, right?

237
00:16:02,885 --> 00:16:03,366
Let's go.

238
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,671
Commissioner Burrell, please.

239
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:06,779
<i>Who's calling, please?</i>

240
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:07,899
It's Councilman Carcetti.

241
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:08,767
<i>Hold please. </i>

242
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,069
<i>Hello. </i>

243
00:16:10,281 --> 00:16:11,712
Erv, I'm givin'
you a heads up.

244
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:14,386
You're gonna get a call
from a Sun papers reporter

245
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:15,465
about the academy class.

246
00:16:15,493 --> 00:16:16,877
<i>What the fuck, is this a joke?</i>

247
00:16:16,912 --> 00:16:19,341
Calm the hell down, Erv.
You just no-comment the fucker.

248
00:16:19,376 --> 00:16:21,605
<i>You tellin' me my name
will be no where near this</i>

249
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,036
<i>and then send a reporter my way. </i>

250
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:25,129
Exactly. Then you call
the mayor yourself

251
00:16:25,164 --> 00:16:27,366
and you tell him you
got a reporter nosing around

252
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:29,149
about the academy
class getting pushed.

253
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,155
You tell him you
have no idea how it leaked.

254
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,867
<i>I know this shit's
coming back to me. </i>

255
00:16:32,902 --> 00:16:34,334
Trust me you're
covered on this.

256
00:16:34,356 --> 00:16:34,917
<i>Goddamn it. </i>

257
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,251
<i>You can't hang me out there
like this with the Mayor. </i>

258
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:38,799
<i>My ass is flapping
in the breeze. </i>

259
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:40,829
You want that class, Erv.
You gotta trust me.

260
00:16:40,852 --> 00:16:41,298
<i>Shit!</i>

261
00:16:58,765 --> 00:16:59,891
How you even find me?

262
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,085
Ran into Lukas.

263
00:17:02,237 --> 00:17:03,692
Don't even call his nigger.

264
00:17:03,926 --> 00:17:05,545
Nigger still owes me money.

265
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:08,251
He just told me
how to find you that's all.

266
00:17:09,976 --> 00:17:11,231
He tell you how I'm doing?

267
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,233
I know what you thinking.

268
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:21,081
You ain't looking
all that yourself.

269
00:17:21,937 --> 00:17:23,229
You look just fine, girl.

270
00:17:23,816 --> 00:17:25,845
Just tryin' to find
your sister that's all.

271
00:17:26,396 --> 00:17:27,968
She ain't for you no more.

272
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,476
She ain't for none of our kind.

273
00:17:34,113 --> 00:17:35,451
Gone out county-way.

274
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:36,694
Picked herself up.

275
00:17:37,351 --> 00:17:39,451
County clothes, county car.

276
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:44,359
County nose to look down
on all us city niggers with.

277
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,819
She a teacher.

278
00:17:49,274 --> 00:17:49,849
Where at?

279
00:17:49,884 --> 00:17:51,655
Don't be rushin' me,
motherfucker.

280
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:58,798
I know you lookin'
to tip on out of here

281
00:17:58,821 --> 00:18:00,194
get your aftershave on

282
00:18:00,522 --> 00:18:01,554
get yourself correct.

283
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,533
She teach speech.

284
00:18:13,046 --> 00:18:16,366
Make it so every nigger
sound like Condo-Lisa.

285
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:25,311
Up by the B. Wells.

286
00:18:36,221 --> 00:18:37,282
'Scuse me, Sir.

287
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:39,627
'Scuse me, have you
seen this little girl?

288
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:40,532
This my baby.

289
00:18:40,543 --> 00:18:42,491
Can you just take
that picture with you?

290
00:18:42,526 --> 00:18:44,062
Thank you so much, god bless.

291
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,497
'Scuse me, have you
seen this little girl

292
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:47,870
Lady, you gonna
have to back up.

293
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,134
She's my little girl.
Please, she's only four years old.

294
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:52,715
I ain't seen your little girl,
you're gonna have to back up.

295
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,294
- Please, just take a look at her!
- I ain't seen your...

296
00:18:55,313 --> 00:18:55,773
How do?

297
00:19:20,774 --> 00:19:21,501
Let's go.

298
00:19:22,392 --> 00:19:23,249
Where it at, man?

299
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:28,617
Back there.

300
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:41,218
So, what up, man?
You don't value my time?

301
00:19:41,241 --> 00:19:42,203
Nigga, please.

302
00:19:43,189 --> 00:19:45,664
Hand me that screw gun
and calm the fuck down.

303
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:47,282
Go! Go!

304
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:49,393
Clear!

305
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:51,607
Tosha go!

306
00:20:52,346 --> 00:20:53,613
Dante, go, I got your back!

307
00:20:54,774 --> 00:20:56,217
Oh, I got you, baby.
I got you.

308
00:20:57,801 --> 00:20:58,727
Go! Go!

309
00:21:00,788 --> 00:21:01,574
Go! Go!

310
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,689
Yo, y'all ready.

311
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:49,396
Let's bang out.

312
00:21:59,338 --> 00:22:00,828
Go, go, go!

313
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:01,333
Go!

314
00:22:29,629 --> 00:22:31,010
Come on, Kimmy,
get in the car!

315
00:22:31,127 --> 00:22:32,394
Get in the car, man.

316
00:22:44,828 --> 00:22:47,444
Your department leaks
like a fucking sieve.

317
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,470
It could be someone
over here at the hall.

318
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:53,687
Someone on your staff.
Someone on the Council.

319
00:22:53,863 --> 00:22:55,165
Well, it doesn't matter now.

320
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,241
We gotta spin it
the best way we can,

321
00:22:57,253 --> 00:22:58,778
which means,
we need you to step up

322
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:00,385
and take this one
for the team, Erv.

323
00:23:00,408 --> 00:23:00,795
Me?

324
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,675
Tell the newspaper
that the academy class

325
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,235
has been delayed
for some reason.

326
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:06,455
Lack of recruits

327
00:23:06,983 --> 00:23:08,601
problems in your
personnel division.

328
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,587
Keep it in your shop.

329
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,522
After which,
the Mayor steps in

330
00:23:11,604 --> 00:23:13,299
announces we'll have
an academy class

331
00:23:13,322 --> 00:23:14,953
in january come hell
or high water.

332
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,970
Do it like that,
it's a one-day story.

333
00:23:17,557 --> 00:23:20,431
Mr. Mayor, this was
a budget question.

334
00:23:20,994 --> 00:23:23,469
I was directed
to delay that class.

335
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,791
And you took the hit then

336
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,457
and you're taking the hit now.

337
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,967
And I thank you
for both, Commissioner.

338
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:41,758
89.

339
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:45,312
And that's just the ones
with Westside addresses.

340
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:46,988
You gotta narrow
that shit down

341
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:49,310
find some way to work
with all them Peanuts.

342
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:52,063
Motherfucker, do I look like
George Washington Carver?

343
00:23:56,263 --> 00:23:59,559
Cocksuckers got me chasing one
gun through a city full of 'em.

344
00:24:00,744 --> 00:24:01,811
Homicide, yeah.

345
00:24:01,864 --> 00:24:03,506
<i>Two down, Pall Mall
and Pimlico. </i>

346
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,703
Pall Mall
and Pimlico.

347
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:06,181
Got it.

348
00:24:10,321 --> 00:24:11,799
Two down, in the street.

349
00:24:12,902 --> 00:24:13,850
Ray Cole's up.

350
00:24:15,751 --> 00:24:16,947
Cole's in court today.

351
00:24:18,073 --> 00:24:20,396
And I caught that cutting
in Cherry Hill last night.

352
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:24,126
Don't look at me.

353
00:24:24,782 --> 00:24:27,761
I'm in the haystacks, looking
for Dozerman's prodigal gun.

354
00:24:28,336 --> 00:24:30,659
You gonna make me go
back-to-back as a primary?

355
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:33,674
That's some
cold shit, Bunk.

356
00:24:41,441 --> 00:24:42,977
Agg assault with
a two-by-four?

357
00:24:43,013 --> 00:24:45,477
I don't think so.
Put that with the part twos.

358
00:24:46,711 --> 00:24:48,834
This one too.
Assault by pointing.

359
00:24:49,702 --> 00:24:50,805
If you don't use a handgun

360
00:24:50,817 --> 00:24:52,811
you don't get credit
for waving it, alright?

361
00:24:53,808 --> 00:24:54,840
Larceny here.

362
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,615
Hump wrote this up
as a daytime b-and-e.

363
00:24:57,956 --> 00:24:58,882
Fuck this.

364
00:25:01,686 --> 00:25:02,331
Do it clean.

365
00:25:04,372 --> 00:25:05,592
Don't massage anything.

366
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:07,293
Don't sex anything down.

367
00:25:07,486 --> 00:25:08,847
We give 'em the fucking truth.

368
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,251
What about comstat, boss?
They'll rip you.

369
00:25:11,545 --> 00:25:13,364
There's five months
to my 30, right?

370
00:25:16,918 --> 00:25:19,229
Fuck 'em if they
can't take a joke.

371
00:25:21,739 --> 00:25:23,730
The Major no doubt
has some explanation

372
00:25:23,753 --> 00:25:27,436
some excuse if you will,
for a weekly felony

373
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,677
tabulation that's going
in the opposite direction

374
00:25:29,689 --> 00:25:31,120
from the other eight districts.

375
00:25:31,237 --> 00:25:32,182
I have none, Sir.

376
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:34,964
You are content with this?

377
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,146
No, Deputy, I'm unhappy.

378
00:25:38,624 --> 00:25:40,512
I wish we were making
more of an impact.

379
00:25:41,298 --> 00:25:42,455
But doing what we're doing

380
00:25:44,449 --> 00:25:45,892
it's clear that's not the case.

381
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:47,839
Major Colvin

382
00:25:48,285 --> 00:25:50,830
I am under the impression crime
is down in the Western.

383
00:25:51,827 --> 00:25:54,586
Perhaps you misfigured
your felony stats this week.

384
00:25:54,668 --> 00:25:55,349
No, Sir.

385
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:57,331
We were very accurate.

386
00:25:58,164 --> 00:25:59,466
Sometimes the gods are...

387
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,331
uncooperative.

388
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:02,786
Uncooperative?

389
00:26:04,588 --> 00:26:07,181
This is a cooperative effort,
a cooperative department.

390
00:26:08,412 --> 00:26:09,785
Why in the Eastern District,

391
00:26:09,984 --> 00:26:13,034
Lieutenant Daniels exemplified
this new spirit just the other day.

392
00:26:13,796 --> 00:26:14,642
And because of that

393
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:16,390
we got two fresh
homicides in the black

394
00:26:16,402 --> 00:26:18,830
and a lot less bodies on
the streets than could have been

395
00:26:18,853 --> 00:26:20,660
had that drug war
been allowed to drag on.

396
00:26:20,683 --> 00:26:23,451
Mayor has me taking the hit in public
for the late academy class.

397
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,293
You're kidding me?

398
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:25,806
Sacrifice for
the greater good.

399
00:26:25,841 --> 00:26:27,589
Where's the fucking
loyalty, I ask you?

400
00:26:27,613 --> 00:26:30,357
But in the Western, what do
I get from a veteran commander?

401
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,683
You're just having a laugh,
aren't you, Bunny?

402
00:26:34,906 --> 00:26:37,404
You got the real stats
and projections somewhere else.

403
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:40,055
Someone's just outside
the door with them, right?

404
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:41,275
A stripper, maybe?

405
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,470
That would be nice.

406
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,863
She comes in,
flashes a little tit

407
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:47,247
gives us a whiff
of that muff

408
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,853
and delivers
my fucking stat sheets

409
00:26:48,877 --> 00:26:51,693
with a reduction that matches
just what we promised the Mayor.

410
00:26:51,845 --> 00:26:52,971
That would be beautiful.

411
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:56,335
That would be
creme fucking brulee.

412
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,840
But what I got instead
is some half-assed

413
00:27:01,367 --> 00:27:03,991
"I-wish-we-were-doing-better"
platitude that's

414
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:05,481
meant to fool maybe

415
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,202
a six-year-old girl into
thinking you're doing your job.

416
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:10,745
well, she's left the room,
Major Colvin.

417
00:27:11,829 --> 00:27:13,976
She's out there right now
asking the stripper

418
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,876
if she can have her job
when she grows up

419
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,070
because she sure as shit
doesn't want yours.

420
00:27:18,985 --> 00:27:19,653
You know why?

421
00:27:22,046 --> 00:27:24,451
Because there isn't gonna be
a goddamn Western District

422
00:27:24,474 --> 00:27:26,093
in 20 years
if this shit keeps up.

423
00:27:26,363 --> 00:27:29,589
I don't care how many years
you have on this job.

424
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,866
if the felony
rate doesn't fall

425
00:27:32,147 --> 00:27:34,001
you most certainly will.

426
00:27:35,444 --> 00:27:38,728
The gods are fucking you,
you find a way to fuck them back.

427
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,664
It's Baltimore, Gentlemen,

428
00:27:41,108 --> 00:27:43,384
the gods will not save you.

429
00:28:04,565 --> 00:28:05,679
She look like a player?

430
00:28:07,638 --> 00:28:08,318
Bystander?

431
00:28:10,301 --> 00:28:12,225
Right in the middle
of it all if she was.

432
00:28:32,285 --> 00:28:33,974
Yo, my turn to be Omar.

433
00:28:34,103 --> 00:28:34,467
No.

434
00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:37,588
Gimme, please, gimme.

435
00:28:42,443 --> 00:28:44,003
Look, I'm tellin'
you, I was there.

436
00:28:44,027 --> 00:28:46,408
Whitefolks was on the stoop
by the nine-oh-nine club,

437
00:28:46,443 --> 00:28:48,097
an' Apex just
standin' over his ass

438
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:50,532
pumpin' more holes in the boy
than a motherfucker need.

439
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:51,487
Shit, I ain't lyin',

440
00:28:51,534 --> 00:28:53,564
Soon as that motherfuckin'
nine stops talkin'

441
00:28:53,622 --> 00:28:55,205
whitefolks looks up
at Apex, says:

442
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,105
"Bitch, that
the best you got"?

443
00:28:57,129 --> 00:28:58,079
Man, I'm jus' sayin'

444
00:28:58,114 --> 00:29:01,082
a boy got that much white blood,
he got to be a punk.

445
00:29:03,651 --> 00:29:04,584
You want me, boss?

446
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,238
Your numbers way down, Fruit.

447
00:29:07,528 --> 00:29:08,325
Way down.

448
00:29:09,768 --> 00:29:10,953
It's Barksdale's people.

449
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:14,050
They clippin' the dope
fiends comin' up Freemont.

450
00:29:16,757 --> 00:29:18,012
You know, when I ran a shop

451
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,170
an' my numbers dropped

452
00:29:20,991 --> 00:29:22,662
I damn sure did
something 'bout it.

453
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:26,829
- Yeah, I hear that.
- I just want 'em moved.

454
00:29:28,014 --> 00:29:29,304
Take the younguns with you

455
00:29:29,785 --> 00:29:30,923
give 'em a workout.

456
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,307
Alright.

457
00:29:35,225 --> 00:29:36,363
So, Lieutenant

458
00:29:37,055 --> 00:29:39,917
you got an attaboy
from the deputy today, huh.

459
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:42,885
Cost me my wire tap though.

460
00:29:44,105 --> 00:29:46,692
Still, it's good work
over in the Eastern.

461
00:29:47,503 --> 00:29:49,134
Knocking down a drug war.

462
00:29:49,943 --> 00:29:52,700
Yeah, he's gonna do the same
thing for me up on Park Heights.

463
00:29:52,747 --> 00:29:55,781
I got this Kintel Williamson
character who needs some fixing

464
00:29:56,485 --> 00:29:58,491
and Rawls promised
me Daniels and his unit

465
00:29:58,514 --> 00:29:59,593
for about a month or so.

466
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,303
You're getting quite
the rep there, kiddo?

467
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:05,283
So Stan, what's your plan
for the Southeast?

468
00:30:05,365 --> 00:30:07,355
How're you gonna
give Rawls his numbers?

469
00:30:07,414 --> 00:30:10,194
I don't know.
Flex squads on the corners

470
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,138
foot patrols
in the Perkins Homes

471
00:30:13,162 --> 00:30:14,687
overtime out the ass.

472
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,712
And if that don't work,
cheat on the stats.

473
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:20,069
What say you?

474
00:30:20,421 --> 00:30:21,113
Shit, me?

475
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:23,330
I'm gonna go to 12-hour
shifts on the weekends.

476
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:26,673
What about you, Bunny?

477
00:30:28,271 --> 00:30:29,092
I dunno.

478
00:30:32,224 --> 00:30:33,960
I thought I might
legalize drugs.

479
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:39,389
So they hit
the got-damn alley?

480
00:30:39,823 --> 00:30:40,913
And we on 'em.

481
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:44,198
That cocksmokin' motherfucker
with the big-bitch gun?

482
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,169
He was runnin' hard
on his ass, but...

483
00:30:46,215 --> 00:30:47,025
I think I hit him.

484
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,985
Nigger, you ain't hit nobody.

485
00:30:49,484 --> 00:30:50,435
I mighta hit him.

486
00:30:50,493 --> 00:30:52,605
Yo, String,
we hit the one girl.

487
00:30:52,886 --> 00:30:56,452
But after that, man, I ain't
see nobody catch no lead, man.

488
00:30:56,652 --> 00:30:57,461
'Cept for Tank.

489
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,688
Yeah, Tank gone.

490
00:30:58,864 --> 00:31:00,096
The other broad dropped him.

491
00:31:00,154 --> 00:31:01,644
So I guess we even now.

492
00:31:03,145 --> 00:31:04,389
So you get one, right?

493
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:05,292
Yeah.

494
00:31:05,832 --> 00:31:06,418
That's good.

495
00:31:07,286 --> 00:31:08,823
That's like a 40-degree day?

496
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:12,607
Ain't nobody got nothing
to say about a 40-degree day.

497
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:16,290
50, bring a smile
to your face.

498
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,064
60?

499
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:19,833
Shit, niggers is down there
barbecuing on that motherfucker.

500
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:23,563
Go down to 20, niggers
get their bitch on.

501
00:31:23,856 --> 00:31:25,921
Get their blood complainin'.
But 40?

502
00:31:27,141 --> 00:31:29,381
Nobody give a fuck about 40.

503
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,759
Nobody remember 40
and y'all niggers

504
00:31:31,794 --> 00:31:33,964
is giving me way too
many 40-degree days!?

505
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:34,727
What the fuck!?

506
00:31:41,944 --> 00:31:44,008
Now, we're gonna cover
that bitch's funeral

507
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:45,169
her fucking wake.

508
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,093
We're gonna be
all over that motherfucker

509
00:31:47,117 --> 00:31:48,603
till the bitch
hit the ground.

510
00:31:48,614 --> 00:31:50,749
And if the faggot roll up
to pay his respects

511
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:52,749
we're gonna be
on that motherfucker...

512
00:31:52,784 --> 00:31:54,450
yo, who the fuck you
talking to, man?

513
00:31:54,473 --> 00:31:55,411
It's Donette, String.

514
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,392
She been callin'.

515
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:56,990
No.

516
00:31:58,521 --> 00:31:59,436
Put the phone down.

517
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:03,119
Y'all feel me on this?

518
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:05,067
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

519
00:32:05,712 --> 00:32:06,380
He show up

520
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:08,311
we on him
like a motherfucker...

521
00:32:08,334 --> 00:32:09,366
like a 40-degree day.

522
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:48,965
So, overall
felonies are down

523
00:32:50,404 --> 00:32:51,554
but murders are still up.

524
00:32:52,234 --> 00:32:53,266
What's our next move?

525
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:54,533
Let me bump overtime

526
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,655
and court pay for homicide
and district ops.

527
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,518
Cases go into the green
before they go into the black.

528
00:33:01,737 --> 00:33:02,160
Done.

529
00:33:02,828 --> 00:33:05,549
And, of course, if we could get
some help at the courthouse

530
00:33:05,573 --> 00:33:06,641
it would go a long way.

531
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:08,930
If you're going to try
and dig your way out this

532
00:33:08,942 --> 00:33:10,033
don't make me your shovel.

533
00:33:10,045 --> 00:33:12,590
My department is bringing you
casework that goes nowhere.

534
00:33:12,614 --> 00:33:13,752
The cases are thin.

535
00:33:13,986 --> 00:33:15,230
Most wouldn't make it past

536
00:33:15,265 --> 00:33:17,235
a prelim in the court
of a freshman judge.

537
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:19,936
Well, maybe if your personnel
weren't so got-damned concerned

538
00:33:19,948 --> 00:33:21,573
for their got-damned
conviction rate

539
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,068
they'd chance
a whodunit or two.

540
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,006
Oh, for chrissake!

541
00:33:24,042 --> 00:33:26,505
Jesus, at least pretend
you're on the same side.

542
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:31,043
Stephen, you and I are both
going to be counting votes

543
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:31,993
this time next year.

544
00:33:32,017 --> 00:33:33,776
Do something to help
our sorry asses.

545
00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:36,369
And Erv, if you want
to do more than just

546
00:33:36,404 --> 00:33:37,436
finish out walker's term

547
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:39,571
show me something more
than a pass of the buck.

548
00:33:41,222 --> 00:33:44,248
I don't think any of us
wants to have to get a real job.

549
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:52,758
Mr. Mayor.

550
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:53,720
Alright.

551
00:33:54,271 --> 00:33:56,195
I'll see you both
in here on this next week.

552
00:33:56,206 --> 00:33:56,887
Thank you, Sir.

553
00:34:01,351 --> 00:34:01,973
Like children.

554
00:34:03,404 --> 00:34:05,316
Demper's always
been a hack.

555
00:34:05,562 --> 00:34:07,908
But he's an elected hack,
so we're stuck with him.

556
00:34:08,623 --> 00:34:09,867
But burrell, though?

557
00:34:11,169 --> 00:34:13,146
You're vulnerable
on crime, Clarence.

558
00:34:13,298 --> 00:34:15,187
You need to set some
deadwood adrift.

559
00:34:15,504 --> 00:34:17,380
Burrell's got friends.

560
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:18,565
The ministers?

561
00:34:20,067 --> 00:34:22,190
He might be their man,
but so are you.

562
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:25,636
You fire Burrell, you get
some new blood in there

563
00:34:25,718 --> 00:34:27,009
the crime rate drops, huh?

564
00:34:27,595 --> 00:34:29,472
The ministers
will live with it.

565
00:34:30,727 --> 00:34:32,698
So you're tough
on deadwood, huh?

566
00:34:34,177 --> 00:34:36,030
In the new 11th
district too, I hear.

567
00:34:37,966 --> 00:34:38,951
Mr. Mayor

568
00:34:40,183 --> 00:34:41,684
it's time for Eunetta to go.

569
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:42,924
She's had her time

570
00:34:43,006 --> 00:34:45,294
there are better people
out there for the council.

571
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:47,053
She's on the team, Odell.

572
00:34:47,229 --> 00:34:49,024
just like my police
commissioner.

573
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,511
I value loyalty.

574
00:34:52,531 --> 00:34:53,053
Don't you?

575
00:34:54,906 --> 00:34:56,889
Bunky Bunk.
Where's my Bunk?

576
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,557
Cole's up, not you.

577
00:35:03,314 --> 00:35:05,027
You're on Dozerman's
gun, remember?

578
00:35:05,391 --> 00:35:06,575
Cole's at the courthouse.

579
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:07,326
Sue me.

580
00:35:08,253 --> 00:35:10,634
Rawls and Foerster
have crawled up into my backside

581
00:35:10,681 --> 00:35:13,191
and they're gonna stay there
until you find Dozerman's gun.

582
00:35:13,293 --> 00:35:15,275
Now, I would like it
very much if I could

583
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:17,797
unclench my ample asscheeks

584
00:35:18,114 --> 00:35:18,958
if you don't mind

585
00:35:19,111 --> 00:35:20,084
and rid myself

586
00:35:20,483 --> 00:35:21,574
of that discomfort.

587
00:35:21,691 --> 00:35:23,615
Jay, I just caught one
that pushed it's way

588
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,409
all the way to
the top of my stack.

589
00:35:26,556 --> 00:35:27,471
A victim, Jay.

590
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:29,652
- On the real side.
- Do tell.

591
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,042
Second body in a double.

592
00:35:33,852 --> 00:35:36,408
Girl in her 20s, caught
in the middle of a firefight

593
00:35:36,444 --> 00:35:37,452
takes one in the dome.

594
00:35:37,476 --> 00:35:40,444
But, she's still dead in a zip code
that does not fucking matter

595
00:35:40,866 --> 00:35:43,259
and you still owe me
a departmental-issue nine.

596
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,693
Find the fucking gun, Bunk.

597
00:35:56,437 --> 00:35:57,282
Fuck me.

598
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,768
Kintel Williamson,
who the fuck?

599
00:35:59,804 --> 00:36:01,293
He has corners
in Park Heights.

600
00:36:01,317 --> 00:36:02,396
But Jesus, who doesn't?

601
00:36:02,443 --> 00:36:04,062
So all day we're
calling you, Jimmy

602
00:36:04,085 --> 00:36:05,512
wonderin' where you were at.

603
00:36:06,591 --> 00:36:08,620
Kima, maybe you
can enlighten us.

604
00:36:08,702 --> 00:36:09,488
Don't look at me.

605
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:13,124
My runnin' buddy don't even tell
me where he's off to these days.

606
00:36:13,863 --> 00:36:15,072
I was at the library.

607
00:36:15,402 --> 00:36:15,906
Bullshit.

608
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,689
The library at M.C.I. Jessup.

609
00:36:21,032 --> 00:36:22,886
D'angelo barksdale
was not a suicide.

610
00:36:23,824 --> 00:36:24,915
The M.E. tell you that?

611
00:36:25,009 --> 00:36:25,830
He didn't need to.

612
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:27,632
The physical evidence
didn't match up.

613
00:36:27,656 --> 00:36:29,732
Look, I don't like
coming up off Stringer

614
00:36:29,756 --> 00:36:31,339
and Prop Joe
anymore than you do

615
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:33,943
but McNulty,
this shit is kinda weak.

616
00:36:34,131 --> 00:36:35,762
Cedric is under
a lot of pressure

617
00:36:35,808 --> 00:36:37,872
to use this unit to get
the murder rate down.

618
00:36:37,883 --> 00:36:38,446
So, for now

619
00:36:38,974 --> 00:36:41,051
Stringer Bell's jacket
belongs in narcotics.

620
00:36:41,168 --> 00:36:42,880
Man took you
off a boat, Jimmy.

621
00:36:43,162 --> 00:36:46,177
He want to peel his unit off,
his unit, Jimmy.

622
00:36:46,647 --> 00:36:49,990
And go after the target of his
choice, maybe it's his call.

623
00:36:50,882 --> 00:36:54,682
Lester, I thought you were
all about the best case possible.

624
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,852
When it's there, I am.

625
00:37:53,634 --> 00:37:55,323
Yo, I need y'all
to hear this, man.

626
00:37:59,957 --> 00:38:01,200
It was my fault.

627
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:03,544
Ya hear me?

628
00:38:05,152 --> 00:38:05,949
I'm sorry, yo.

629
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,451
That don't do nothin' for me.

630
00:38:34,168 --> 00:38:34,802
How come...

631
00:38:36,467 --> 00:38:38,778
they know you're police
when they hook up with you.

632
00:38:40,045 --> 00:38:42,238
And they know you're
police when they move in.

633
00:38:43,705 --> 00:38:44,863
And they know you're police

634
00:38:44,886 --> 00:38:46,962
when they decide
to start a family with you.

635
00:38:48,335 --> 00:38:49,872
And all that shit is just fine

636
00:38:50,575 --> 00:38:51,748
until one day it ain't.

637
00:38:52,945 --> 00:38:53,786
One day, it's:

638
00:38:54,701 --> 00:38:56,378
"you should have
a regular job. "

639
00:38:57,505 --> 00:38:59,323
"You need to be
home at 5:00".

640
00:39:00,156 --> 00:39:01,399
"You need to call more. "

641
00:39:02,431 --> 00:39:03,002
I'm sayin'.

642
00:39:03,753 --> 00:39:05,536
"You need to stop
fucking waitresses. "

643
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:13,130
I wanna come down
here tomorrow to Western.

644
00:39:13,377 --> 00:39:15,464
See what's what since
those towers came down.

645
00:39:17,236 --> 00:39:19,265
We're supposed to start
on Kintel tomorrow.

646
00:39:19,312 --> 00:39:20,567
Oh, fuck that chump.

647
00:39:21,165 --> 00:39:22,198
He can wait day or two.

648
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,617
Yeah, okay.

649
00:39:24,266 --> 00:39:25,040
What the fuck.

650
00:39:32,113 --> 00:39:34,154
When you were humpin'
a radio car in the Western?

651
00:39:34,218 --> 00:39:35,098
Was this your hole?

652
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:36,412
Yeah.

653
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:39,785
Here and down on Winchester.
Under the bridge.

654
00:39:40,113 --> 00:39:41,884
Bet there were a lot
of nights you didn't

655
00:39:41,908 --> 00:39:43,151
go home to the missus.

656
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,488
Don't tell me
I'm the same kinda asshole.

657
00:39:48,547 --> 00:39:49,693
Pucker up, girlfriend.

658
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,192
Jesus.

659
00:39:53,118 --> 00:39:54,655
I'm turning into McNulty.

660
00:40:34,591 --> 00:40:36,315
Hey, I'm going out.

661
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,635
Nah, grandma,
you know I can't.

662
00:40:39,893 --> 00:40:42,497
Times like these,
honey, you have to shine.

663
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,947
In your face, in your clothes

664
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,481
and in your pocket.
Now, go on.

665
00:40:48,994 --> 00:40:50,906
Make sure you get
something to eat, hear?

666
00:40:51,047 --> 00:40:51,915
Go on, now.

667
00:41:01,946 --> 00:41:02,873
You know 'em?

668
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:03,975
sNot a clue.

669
00:41:08,113 --> 00:41:09,743
Crew on that corner
looks familiar.

670
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:16,101
A couple old faces.

671
00:41:18,224 --> 00:41:18,940
Not many.

672
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:23,280
You go away for a year
and the whole world changes up.

673
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,415
Quiet though.

674
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:28,467
Barksdale loses the towers

675
00:41:28,491 --> 00:41:30,931
and he's able to stretch out
without bodies falling?

676
00:41:32,373 --> 00:41:34,942
I wonder what the Western
guys have been seeing lately.

677
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:41,731
Hey, Jay.

678
00:41:48,974 --> 00:41:50,065
What the fuck happened?

679
00:41:51,227 --> 00:41:51,614
When?

680
00:41:53,584 --> 00:41:54,136
How is he?

681
00:41:58,158 --> 00:41:58,861
Aw, shit.

682
00:42:03,952 --> 00:42:05,172
You'll let me know, right?

683
00:42:07,845 --> 00:42:08,572
Okay, yeah.

684
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:10,226
Thanks.

685
00:42:13,991 --> 00:42:14,883
You know Ray Cole?

686
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:16,420
Homicide, right?

687
00:42:18,558 --> 00:42:21,045
Collapsed in the gym at the
central district this morning.

688
00:42:22,558 --> 00:42:24,130
On a fucking
stairmaster.

689
00:42:25,115 --> 00:42:25,959
Well, how is he?

690
00:42:26,886 --> 00:42:27,801
A stairmaster.

691
00:42:36,391 --> 00:42:37,846
Hey, Puddin', check it out.

692
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,077
Where they at?

693
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:40,090
I don't know.

694
00:42:42,788 --> 00:42:43,550
Look out, man.

695
00:42:53,646 --> 00:42:54,760
Break it, motherfuckers.

696
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:57,707
Man said break, come on.

697
00:42:57,718 --> 00:42:58,962
I was workin' on that bitch.

698
00:43:00,404 --> 00:43:01,319
Yeah, Shorty, you hard.

699
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:03,982
We outta here.

700
00:43:15,285 --> 00:43:17,205
The Commissioner
acknowledged that money

701
00:43:17,217 --> 00:43:19,047
had been budgeted
for the academy class

702
00:43:19,481 --> 00:43:21,545
but said the department
was awaiting approval

703
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,422
of a federal training
and education grant

704
00:43:23,457 --> 00:43:25,323
before scheduling the program.

705
00:43:25,651 --> 00:43:27,484
Burrell can talk
some shit, can't he?

706
00:43:30,029 --> 00:43:31,261
Downtown in the house.

707
00:43:31,531 --> 00:43:32,622
Hey, Kima, baby.

708
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,631
Hey, Ellis.

709
00:43:35,777 --> 00:43:36,211
Herc.

710
00:43:38,064 --> 00:43:39,601
So, what do we
owe the pleasure?

711
00:43:39,636 --> 00:43:42,580
Cruisin' your district, seeing
what's up since the towers fell.

712
00:43:42,627 --> 00:43:44,480
We see Barksdale crews
on a few corners

713
00:43:44,504 --> 00:43:46,357
but no one seems
to be beefin' with 'em.

714
00:43:46,392 --> 00:43:48,125
What's up with
all this brotherhood?

715
00:43:48,136 --> 00:43:49,427
We keep the lid on tight.

716
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:51,421
You know, they know
we are not their friends

717
00:43:51,432 --> 00:43:53,415
and they damn well know
we'll take it to 'em

718
00:43:53,438 --> 00:43:54,388
if they don't behave.

719
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:56,852
What do your C.I.'s tell you?

720
00:43:57,895 --> 00:43:58,598
Fuck C.I.'s.

721
00:43:58,622 --> 00:44:00,029
We don't need
no stinkin' C.I.'s.

722
00:44:00,123 --> 00:44:02,364
We tune 'em up, we beat 'em
down, we lock 'em up.

723
00:44:02,669 --> 00:44:04,463
It's the Western District way.

724
00:44:06,704 --> 00:44:07,264
Sergeant

725
00:44:07,416 --> 00:44:09,915
you're wanted in roll call
for a supervisor's meeting.

726
00:44:12,437 --> 00:44:13,269
Gotta go.

727
00:44:17,678 --> 00:44:18,957
Remember, what I told you?

728
00:44:19,461 --> 00:44:21,608
A police is only
as good as his informants?

729
00:44:21,807 --> 00:44:23,602
Well, we ain't downtown
no more, Kima.

730
00:44:23,613 --> 00:44:24,833
We're in the trenches here.

731
00:44:24,916 --> 00:44:27,086
You want information,
you go get your own C.I.

732
00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:27,977
And shoot the shit.

733
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:36,710
You're late, Sergeant.

734
00:44:36,922 --> 00:44:39,080
I had a couple downtown
detectives in my shop.

735
00:44:39,092 --> 00:44:41,378
They were confused
and required assistance, Sir.

736
00:44:45,988 --> 00:44:47,161
Well, I'll catch you up.

737
00:44:49,377 --> 00:44:51,160
The new strategic plan
for the district

738
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,413
is to move all
street-level trafficking

739
00:44:53,753 --> 00:44:54,797
to these three areas.

740
00:44:55,594 --> 00:44:56,627
We want to push it.

741
00:44:57,225 --> 00:44:58,105
Push it, boss?

742
00:44:58,339 --> 00:45:00,322
If they don't go easy,
then they go hard.

743
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:01,054
But...

744
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:03,705
we let these knuckleheads know

745
00:45:04,374 --> 00:45:06,251
that if they
move to these areas...

746
00:45:06,462 --> 00:45:08,057
away from
the residential streets

747
00:45:08,186 --> 00:45:10,462
away from commercial areas,
away from schools...

748
00:45:10,931 --> 00:45:12,677
if they take their
shit down the road

749
00:45:13,615 --> 00:45:16,606
they go about their business
without any interference from us.

750
00:45:17,357 --> 00:45:19,597
It's going to be hands-off
in the Western District

751
00:45:19,609 --> 00:45:20,770
for the foreseeable future.

752
00:45:20,794 --> 00:45:23,555
Bullshit, man,
no fuckin' way.

753
00:45:23,566 --> 00:45:24,106
Wait, wait.

754
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:26,464
You're saying you want us
to give them a free pass?

755
00:45:26,499 --> 00:45:28,235
How we going to look
them in the eye?

756
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:29,338
They'll shit all over us.

757
00:45:29,361 --> 00:45:31,015
Tell their kids
to shit all over us.

758
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:32,481
Hey, the Major
wasn't finished.

759
00:45:34,878 --> 00:45:36,450
You gotta take
the long view here.

760
00:45:38,034 --> 00:45:38,585
Once

761
00:45:39,993 --> 00:45:41,248
once they're all comfortable

762
00:45:41,623 --> 00:45:43,301
once they're all rounded up

763
00:45:44,511 --> 00:45:46,059
once they've been
down there a bit

764
00:45:46,071 --> 00:45:47,948
and they're used to
putting their feet up

765
00:45:47,971 --> 00:45:49,109
and playing wit the remote

766
00:45:50,399 --> 00:45:51,783
then we move.

767
00:45:52,651 --> 00:45:55,150
Then we go back
and we do police work.

768
00:45:56,155 --> 00:45:57,516
Look at it this way, Gentlemen

769
00:45:58,337 --> 00:46:00,401
would you rather
shoot a fish in the ocean?

770
00:46:00,906 --> 00:46:03,099
Or would you rather
gather 'em up

771
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:05,194
in a few small barrels

772
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:07,716
and start emptying
your clips then?

773
00:46:07,762 --> 00:46:10,836
Not to mention, you still get to kick
the shit out of all the mopes

774
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:12,243
who don't move off our corners.

775
00:46:13,803 --> 00:46:14,789
So, it ain't all bad.

776
00:46:22,403 --> 00:46:23,142
Slow up, girl.

777
00:46:24,421 --> 00:46:25,019
Come on now.

778
00:46:30,929 --> 00:46:31,844
So, this your ride?

779
00:46:33,474 --> 00:46:34,237
It's nice.

780
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:35,973
Suppose you got a Lex.

781
00:46:36,195 --> 00:46:36,993
Nah, girl.

782
00:46:37,627 --> 00:46:38,631
Got a bus pass.

783
00:46:39,722 --> 00:46:40,696
You out the game, then.

784
00:46:41,939 --> 00:46:43,781
Doing a little
landscaping right now.

785
00:46:44,696 --> 00:46:46,033
But tryin' to figure
things out.

786
00:46:49,729 --> 00:46:52,251
So, what's your boy's name?

787
00:46:52,696 --> 00:46:53,271
Allen.

788
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:54,292
After Iverson?

789
00:46:54,855 --> 00:46:55,758
After his daddy.

790
00:47:01,102 --> 00:47:01,501
What?

791
00:47:01,958 --> 00:47:04,703
Trying to picture
you mowing a land.

792
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:08,644
I don't be wearin' the suit.

793
00:47:09,814 --> 00:47:11,093
You look good in it still.

794
00:47:11,468 --> 00:47:12,465
You look good too.

795
00:47:12,524 --> 00:47:13,814
You know they bought

796
00:47:14,037 --> 00:47:16,043
a lot a folks out
with early retirement

797
00:47:16,078 --> 00:47:16,841
in parks and rec.

798
00:47:17,638 --> 00:47:19,926
I could maybe hook you up
with someone to talk to.

799
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:22,335
A man at my church
is helping the city

800
00:47:22,347 --> 00:47:23,473
fill a lot of those jobs.

801
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:25,444
That would be...

802
00:47:26,112 --> 00:47:26,746
thank you.

803
00:47:30,312 --> 00:47:31,356
Write your
number there.

804
00:47:32,842 --> 00:47:33,570
He'll call you.

805
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:40,232
I gotta go.

806
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:42,191
It was good seeing you.

807
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:45,305
Grace.

808
00:47:47,604 --> 00:47:48,584
Looking at you.

809
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:50,321
What?

810
00:47:51,429 --> 00:47:51,973
Hurts.

811
00:47:53,232 --> 00:47:54,405
Shouldn't look then.

812
00:48:06,405 --> 00:48:08,446
Food blast'll
take yer mind off it.

813
00:48:08,751 --> 00:48:10,193
Rather my mind on it, Bubs?

814
00:48:12,211 --> 00:48:13,841
Swear I'm sick
of all this, man.

815
00:48:14,898 --> 00:48:16,306
Wonderin' when
I got so old.

816
00:48:16,587 --> 00:48:18,546
How 'bout some more
mac n' cheese, huh?

817
00:48:18,617 --> 00:48:19,285
Hey, Bubs.

818
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:20,986
Kima.

819
00:48:21,104 --> 00:48:21,631
Hey, Bub.

820
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:24,177
McNutty, man, my mainest man.

821
00:48:25,091 --> 00:48:26,522
You ready to put
some work in?

822
00:48:26,546 --> 00:48:27,109
Born ready.

823
00:48:27,672 --> 00:48:29,162
Snitchin'?
Fuck that, Bubs.

824
00:48:29,279 --> 00:48:30,405
Hey, hey, nah, man.

825
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,587
Better than liftin'
500 pound radiators.

826
00:48:32,915 --> 00:48:34,393
I'm up for these two, Johnny.

827
00:48:34,863 --> 00:48:35,939
It's easy money, man.

828
00:48:36,103 --> 00:48:36,537
C'mon

829
00:48:37,229 --> 00:48:38,132
let's grab a burger.

830
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:42,508
Mind if I bang
outta here early?

831
00:48:42,895 --> 00:48:44,549
I ain't right
with this Cole thing.

832
00:48:45,229 --> 00:48:47,482
Gonna be a detectives'
wake at Kavanagh's tonight.

833
00:48:47,518 --> 00:48:48,268
You gonna come?

834
00:48:48,421 --> 00:48:49,394
Barely knew the guy.

835
00:48:50,392 --> 00:48:52,210
You all layin' him
out at the bar, huh?

836
00:48:52,503 --> 00:48:53,183
Tradition.

837
00:48:53,301 --> 00:48:55,576
Tomorrow night, he goes
the funeral home for family.

838
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,552
Tonight, Ray drinks
with the boys.

839
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:00,836
C'mon, Bubs,
we ain't got all day.

840
00:49:05,351 --> 00:49:07,948
And he's up for re-election
and he's never had a single one

841
00:49:07,972 --> 00:49:09,837
of his goo-goo bills
pass the committee.

842
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:12,277
So, he's got one for
all-day kindergarten

843
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,412
I mean who's gonna argue
with more kindergarten?

844
00:49:14,424 --> 00:49:16,218
I mean, this guy
has got a bill which is

845
00:49:16,242 --> 00:49:18,879
the legislative equivalent
of kissing a baby.

846
00:49:19,465 --> 00:49:20,990
So, right, he goes
to his chairman

847
00:49:21,002 --> 00:49:22,057
pleads his case and says:

848
00:49:22,081 --> 00:49:24,110
"You know, this don't
go through, I'm torched. "

849
00:49:24,134 --> 00:49:26,691
"I'm going to be back
in that hardware store, mixing paint. "

850
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:28,354
So, the chairman
takes pity and agrees

851
00:49:28,389 --> 00:49:30,724
gets the bill to the floor.
But the house speaker?

852
00:49:30,747 --> 00:49:31,756
He hates this bill.

853
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:33,633
So, it gets loved
to death, you know...

854
00:49:33,668 --> 00:49:36,366
slap on an amendment
for another 150 mil in costs

855
00:49:36,401 --> 00:49:39,342
subsidies, handouts and
the bill goes down in flames.

856
00:49:39,365 --> 00:49:40,632
122 to 10.

857
00:49:40,656 --> 00:49:42,861
The delegate, he can
smell those paint cans.

858
00:49:42,884 --> 00:49:43,834
And the chairman says:

859
00:49:43,858 --> 00:49:47,502
"Hey, sorry brother,
I fought like a tiger for that bill. "

860
00:49:49,074 --> 00:49:50,435
Who wants friends like that?

861
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:52,781
You want friends
in this racket, get a dog.

862
00:49:54,251 --> 00:49:54,615
What?

863
00:49:56,468 --> 00:49:57,759
I need to talk to him.

864
00:49:59,354 --> 00:50:01,043
Look, just tell
him it's Donette.

865
00:50:02,251 --> 00:50:03,976
Yeah, he know
who the fuck I am.

866
00:50:04,574 --> 00:50:06,147
- YoSstring, she say...
- Not now.

867
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:09,619
Look, he say not now,
I gotta go.

868
00:50:16,473 --> 00:50:16,895
Marlo.

869
00:50:17,317 --> 00:50:18,467
It's a problem, String.

870
00:50:22,127 --> 00:50:23,335
Club soda and lime.

871
00:50:24,402 --> 00:50:26,045
You'll never
get there that way.

872
00:50:27,623 --> 00:50:28,140
Get where?

873
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:33,547
Excuse me.

874
00:50:38,064 --> 00:50:39,179
How the hell was I to know

875
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:41,196
the Mayor was gonna
put the screws to you?

876
00:50:41,677 --> 00:50:42,639
You read the paper?

877
00:50:43,554 --> 00:50:44,797
I look like shit.

878
00:50:45,137 --> 00:50:47,132
Hey, you got your class

879
00:50:47,894 --> 00:50:49,067
and probably scored points

880
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:51,565
with Royce out
of sheer loyalty, right?

881
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:24,652
We are police

882
00:51:27,162 --> 00:51:28,757
so no lies between us.

883
00:51:30,763 --> 00:51:32,073
He wasn't
the greatest detective

884
00:51:33,469 --> 00:51:34,561
and he wasn't the worst.

885
00:51:35,604 --> 00:51:38,419
He put down some good cases
and he dogged a few bad ones.

886
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,855
But, the motherfucker
had his moments.

887
00:51:41,879 --> 00:51:42,981
Yes, he fucking did.

888
00:51:44,624 --> 00:51:48,190
You remember
the Mississippi extradition

889
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:49,158
the Arson murders?

890
00:51:49,686 --> 00:51:50,930
He brought that case home.

891
00:51:51,223 --> 00:51:52,044
And the triple

892
00:51:52,431 --> 00:51:54,425
at the after-hours
over on Hudson Street?

893
00:51:54,625 --> 00:51:56,652
That was Ray Cole at his best.

894
00:51:57,754 --> 00:51:59,608
And Fayette Street...

895
00:52:00,006 --> 00:52:01,695
in '93, the drug wars.

896
00:52:02,376 --> 00:52:04,476
He took a lot of hot
corners and cooled 'em.

897
00:52:06,552 --> 00:52:07,397
Yes, indeed.

898
00:52:11,925 --> 00:52:13,696
He won as much as he lost

899
00:52:14,435 --> 00:52:15,596
much as any of us.

900
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:25,618
For chrissakes, Hugh, play
the fucking song already.

901
00:52:27,455 --> 00:52:29,461
Did he piss off
a wife or three?

902
00:52:30,822 --> 00:52:32,136
No fucking doubt.

903
00:52:33,496 --> 00:52:35,455
I think the last one
actually kinda got used

904
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:36,546
to him, thank God.

905
00:52:37,872 --> 00:52:39,724
Did he say the wrong
shit now and then?

906
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:42,386
Did he bust balls
and cheat on his taxes

907
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:45,436
and forget to call his mother
and fuck the wrong broad

908
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,642
for the wrong fucking
reason every now and then?

909
00:52:47,653 --> 00:52:49,167
Who fucking doesn't, Christ?

910
00:52:50,057 --> 00:52:53,365
Was he as full of shit
as every other sadsack

911
00:52:53,401 --> 00:52:56,603
motherfucker wearing
a badge of Baltimore City Police?

912
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:58,421
Abso-fucking-lutely.

913
00:52:59,277 --> 00:53:01,575
His shit was as weak
as ours, no question.

914
00:53:02,737 --> 00:53:04,086
But Ray Cole stood with us,

915
00:53:06,713 --> 00:53:07,429
all of us

916
00:53:08,965 --> 00:53:09,904
in Baltimore

917
00:53:10,897 --> 00:53:11,484
working

918
00:53:12,446 --> 00:53:15,237
sharing a dark corner
of the american experiment.

919
00:53:21,562 --> 00:53:22,278
He was called.

920
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:26,642
He served.

921
00:53:28,249 --> 00:53:29,011
He is counted.

922
00:53:30,477 --> 00:53:31,228
Old king Cole.

923
00:53:31,521 --> 00:53:33,090
Old king Cole!

924
00:54:53,909 --> 00:54:56,595
I'm sorry, but I gotta
get these guys home.

925
00:54:57,803 --> 00:55:00,721
But all things considered,
I think they did pretty well.

926
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:01,589
They were great.

927
00:55:02,457 --> 00:55:04,088
And you were great,
really, Jen.

928
00:55:05,179 --> 00:55:07,842
Besides, I think they got
all the family shots they need.

929
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:09,859
So, you'll be awhile,
though, huh?

930
00:55:10,826 --> 00:55:12,117
Gotta work the crowd,
you know?

931
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:14,991
Make 'em think
I'm worthy of their faith.

932
00:55:15,038 --> 00:55:15,730
You are.

933
00:55:15,864 --> 00:55:17,554
- Well, thank you...
- Most of the time.

934
00:55:17,573 --> 00:55:17,864
Bitch.

935
00:55:21,648 --> 00:55:23,267
Not too late if you
can help it, okay?

936
00:55:52,869 --> 00:55:54,534
Shit is fucked.

937
00:55:58,065 --> 00:56:01,267
You fucking wake up,
like any other day.

938
00:56:03,892 --> 00:56:04,783
You fucking eat

939
00:56:06,191 --> 00:56:09,006
and think about bills
and dry cleaning and shit

940
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:11,653
and fucking vacation

941
00:56:11,724 --> 00:56:14,997
and your fucking
retirement plan and what?

942
00:56:17,659 --> 00:56:18,328
Like that.

943
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:21,254
Like that.

944
00:56:23,823 --> 00:56:25,078
He checked out of here

945
00:56:26,486 --> 00:56:29,360
with you still owing him
a clearance on that Omar thing.

946
00:56:29,395 --> 00:56:30,415
Oh, I know, I know.

947
00:56:30,861 --> 00:56:31,588
I fucking know.

948
00:56:33,027 --> 00:56:33,661
Like that.

949
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,971
On a fucking stairmaster.

950
00:56:46,326 --> 00:56:48,531
On a fucking stairmaster.

951
00:56:54,131 --> 00:56:55,797
Wake up an' die
right, you cunts.

952
00:58:18,941 --> 00:58:19,960
What's goin' on, man?

953
00:58:23,873 --> 00:58:24,968
That whip is pretty, yo.

954
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:27,071
I gotta get me one
of them joints someday.

955
00:58:27,808 --> 00:58:28,686
Shit. Yeah.
