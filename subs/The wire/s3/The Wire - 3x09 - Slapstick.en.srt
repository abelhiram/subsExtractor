1
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:32,678
Hullo...

2
00:01:32,988 --> 00:01:34,232
<i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

3
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:35,663
Oh, hi.

4
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:36,953
<i>Are you sleeping?</i>

5
00:01:37,035 --> 00:01:37,598
No.

6
00:01:38,238 --> 00:01:39,963
<i>What, you're not happy
to hear from me?<i>

7
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,007
No, I'm glad you called.

8
00:01:41,957 --> 00:01:43,165
<i>I want to see you. <i>

9
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:44,749
Now?

10
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:46,309
<i>Yes, now. </i>

11
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,240
Where are you?

12
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:48,870
<i>Same place as before. </i>

13
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,630
Peabody.

14
00:01:50,946 --> 00:01:52,459
<i>Are you sure
you're not sleeping?</i>

15
00:01:52,483 --> 00:01:53,797
No, no, I was up.

16
00:01:55,685 --> 00:01:56,424
<i>You liar. </i>

17
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,676
<i>Come on, get
your ass over here. <i>

18
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:01,125
Yeah, okay, I mean,
yeah, what the hell.

19
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:02,298
<i>Room 210.</i>

20
00:02:02,673 --> 00:02:03,225
Fine.

21
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,369
Sean, Seanie...

22
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:30,600
What?

23
00:02:30,996 --> 00:02:33,237
I have to go out and see
a friend for a little bit.

24
00:02:33,307 --> 00:02:35,125
I'll be gone for
an hour or two, okay?

25
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:38,527
I put my cell phone number
is on this slip of paper.

26
00:02:39,137 --> 00:02:41,319
I'll put it on that
top shelf, okay?

27
00:02:45,911 --> 00:02:46,838
What did I just say?

28
00:02:47,554 --> 00:02:48,985
You're going out
to see a friend

29
00:02:49,008 --> 00:02:50,545
and your number is
on the top shelf.

30
00:02:50,557 --> 00:02:51,120
Attaboy.

31
00:02:57,895 --> 00:02:59,678
<i>The Kerry camp had
an early opportunity</i>

32
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:01,930
<i>to capitalize on jobs
and the economy as an issue</i>

33
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:03,405
<i>and attack
the president with it. </i>

34
00:03:03,428 --> 00:03:05,868
<i>The pre-election polls show
that a significant number</i>

35
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:09,271
<i>of undecided and persuadable
voters thought Kerry over Bush</i>

36
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,746
<i>offered a better
chance for jobs. </i>

37
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:12,787
<i>Jobs may have been
a marginal issue, Kate</i>

38
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,104
<i>in some of the rust belt
battle ground states. </i>

39
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:18,025
<i>But ultimately
this was a referendum</i>

40
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:20,089
<i>on the leadership of George W. Bush</i>

41
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,306
<i>on the war against terror
and the war in Iraq. </i>

42
00:03:22,447 --> 00:03:23,515
You are so full of shit.

43
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:26,123
Nothing mattered in the red
states but the economy...

44
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,141
I've been saying that for months.

45
00:03:28,927 --> 00:03:30,815
Hey, I'm not tossing you
so quick tonight.

46
00:03:30,898 --> 00:03:32,305
I got nothing to do tomorrow.

47
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:34,581
Well, I'm tossing myself.

48
00:03:35,353 --> 00:03:36,467
I gotta get home.

49
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:43,540
You know what, not that
this wasn't fun

50
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:45,804
but it might be nice
to have dinner first.

51
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:47,493
Dinner and a movie.

52
00:03:47,692 --> 00:03:48,771
I got to Baltimore late.

53
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:50,296
Nah, I'm saying next time.

54
00:03:50,507 --> 00:03:52,419
We talk some, then
we fuck our brains out.

55
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:54,542
It's different for girls like me.

56
00:03:56,577 --> 00:03:58,490
You need to be cuddled, McNulty?

57
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:00,026
No, but we make a date

58
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:02,079
I don't feel like I have
to charge by the hour.

59
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:03,275
A date, huh?

60
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:05,223
I'll call you.

61
00:04:06,548 --> 00:04:07,578
In the daytime.

62
00:04:13,971 --> 00:04:17,068
<i>I think we can all agree that
foreign policy and women... </i>

63
00:04:32,343 --> 00:04:34,887
<i>... all the while the United States
was reeling from the attack</i>

64
00:04:34,888 --> 00:04:35,633
<i>on Pearl Harbor... </i>

65
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,965
<i>the wonders of
wood carving... </i>

66
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,753
<i>he wrapped himself
in the american flag</i>

67
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:41,853
<i>at the convention
and never looked back. </i>

68
00:04:41,993 --> 00:04:44,257
<i>Oh, Kate, that's a little
harsh, don't you think?</i>

69
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:45,653
<i>No, I don't, I'm serious. </i>

70
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:48,682
<i>And I think it was great
strategy by his handlers, too. </i>

71
00:04:49,146 --> 00:04:52,160
<i>You don't think when John Kerry
in his acceptance speech</i>

72
00:04:52,172 --> 00:04:54,166
<i>at the Democratic
National Convention said:</i>

73
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,020
<i>"I'm here under old glory"</i>

74
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,375
<i>that he wasn't trying to wrap
himself in a flag, too?</i>

75
00:04:58,434 --> 00:05:00,909
<i>No, I don't think he was trying
to wrap himself in a flag. </i>

76
00:05:00,932 --> 00:05:02,856
<i>I think he was trying
to defend the people</i>

77
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:04,979
<i>in the battle ground states.
The ones who really... </i>

78
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:12,157
<i>1942, the U.S. first stormed
the shore at Guadalcanal. </i>

79
00:05:12,873 --> 00:05:15,723
<i>Seizing a nearly complete
airfield at Moga Point</i>

80
00:05:16,286 --> 00:05:17,987
<i>which was renamed
Henderson Field. </i>

81
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:20,821
<i>And in anchorage
and nearby Tulagy</i>

82
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,847
<i>that would later be known
as "iron bottom sound"</i>

83
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,651
<i>because of the number
of ships sunk there in battle. </i>

84
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:30,529
<i>The landings of the first day
put nearly 11,000 marines</i>

85
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,629
</i>on the island,
minimal resistance... </i>

86
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:06,471
Slapstick

87
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:16,864
Deep into it, I see.

88
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:19,715
Yeah, gettin' there.

89
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:21,826
You lookin' correct.

90
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,876
Sunday morning. I'm on my way
to hear the word, you know?

91
00:07:27,695 --> 00:07:29,255
Gracias, amigos.

92
00:07:30,874 --> 00:07:32,528
You payin' those guys
out of pocket?

93
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:36,846
Boiler in there's working
and the pipes are okay.

94
00:07:37,186 --> 00:07:39,508
I should have it all cleaned
out by tomorrow, I think.

95
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:41,737
All you gonna need is the permits.

96
00:07:44,024 --> 00:07:44,658
Permits?

97
00:07:45,444 --> 00:07:45,772
Yeah.

98
00:07:46,693 --> 00:07:47,138
Permits.

99
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:57,244
Whoa, is that him?

100
00:07:58,253 --> 00:07:58,663
S hit.

101
00:07:59,168 --> 00:08:01,197
If it ain't, we'd only
be wasting the bullet.

102
00:08:01,842 --> 00:08:04,364
Only problem is it bein' Sunday
mornin' an all, you know?

103
00:08:08,317 --> 00:08:09,058
Who you callin'?

104
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:10,945
Slim Charles, man.

105
00:08:11,003 --> 00:08:13,127
You told me you was supposed
to bring our beefin'

106
00:08:13,138 --> 00:08:14,159
before the group, right?

107
00:08:14,182 --> 00:08:17,021
Here it is you go warrin' with the
young boy, Marlo, over corners.

108
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:18,159
Marlo ain't in the group.

109
00:08:18,851 --> 00:08:19,907
Be that as it may

110
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:22,569
all this shoot-em-up shit
is bad f business.

111
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:25,021
We got cops on half
the Westside corners.

112
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:26,769
And what corners
they ain't holding

113
00:08:26,827 --> 00:08:28,646
I cat have my people
standing on for fear

114
00:08:28,657 --> 00:08:30,791
they gonna be mistaken
as one of Barksdale people

115
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:31,584
an' catch a bullet.

116
00:08:31,602 --> 00:08:34,088
Look, man, I tried to talk
to the young buck myself, but...

117
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,226
You try talkin' to Avon.

118
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,197
Because that's half
the problem right there.

119
00:08:37,432 --> 00:08:38,323
No doubt, exactly.

120
00:08:43,162 --> 00:08:44,441
Nigger probably sleepin' in.

121
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,527
Fact is, Stringer, your man
needs to reconcile himself

122
00:08:55,563 --> 00:08:56,994
to this new way of thinking.

123
00:08:57,404 --> 00:09:00,419
Now, you could remind him that
like everyone else in this room

124
00:09:00,513 --> 00:09:04,034
he benefiting from my connect
and from the wholesale price

125
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,460
we got by throwin' in together.

126
00:09:05,471 --> 00:09:06,938
I mean, he know that, come on, Joe.

127
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:09,882
Well, so, now we comin' to him
for help with a little something.

128
00:09:10,431 --> 00:09:13,575
He need to just back the fuck off
and let the youngun keep his corners.

129
00:09:14,056 --> 00:09:16,648
You said yourself it can't
be about territory no more.

130
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:17,949
Old habits die hard.

131
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:18,490
Who this?

132
00:09:18,607 --> 00:09:19,381
Yeah, it's me.

133
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:22,881
We on the house where
the dude who is, you know...

134
00:09:23,351 --> 00:09:23,972
Talk, nigga.

135
00:09:24,254 --> 00:09:26,142
Shit, man, I'm tryin'
not to use names.

136
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,019
This Gerard, man.

137
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:30,201
We on Omar, he goin'
to come out the house.

138
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:34,597
As you know, I ain't trying to lose
no niggers on them corners either but

139
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:36,755
it's a two way street, you know?

140
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,955
Gerard and Sapper
got their sights on omar.

141
00:09:41,154 --> 00:09:43,229
They tried to raise Slim
an' he ain't answering.

142
00:09:43,393 --> 00:09:43,768
So?

143
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:46,454
It's church day, String.
Sunday morning, you know?

144
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,940
They sure it's him?

145
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:48,730
Omar, yeah.

146
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,050
Alright, do it.

147
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:53,495
Do it.

148
00:09:55,818 --> 00:09:57,155
They right there, c'mon.

149
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:07,528
Oh, my goodness!

150
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,076
This time, I definitely hit him.

151
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,366
District-wide, it's 14%.

152
00:10:26,987 --> 00:10:29,756
A drop like that in the western
felony rate is unheard of.

153
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:34,061
But God knows what happens
when you let go of your secret.

154
00:10:34,814 --> 00:10:36,116
Hey, what happens, happens.

155
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:39,060
I mean, if they want to keep
my little experiment going

156
00:10:39,084 --> 00:10:40,995
or they want to go back
to business as usual.

157
00:10:40,996 --> 00:10:42,228
That's on them. But me?

158
00:10:42,345 --> 00:10:43,952
I'm out of here, D., I'm gone.

159
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:45,661
And... Hopkins came through.

160
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:48,612
I got the contract offer
on that security job yesterday.

161
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,682
You really gonna retire?

162
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:50,517
Always planned to.

163
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:58,307
What?

164
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,946
You started something.

165
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:02,424
You ain't gonna finish it?

166
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:04,090
What do you mean?

167
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:06,928
On a battlefield, you can't do much
to help anybody with anything.

168
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:08,636
But you managed a truce, Bunny.

169
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:10,630
And making the game street legal...

170
00:11:11,557 --> 00:11:12,788
takes the heart out of it.

171
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:15,076
Keep it going, we gonna
reach some of those people

172
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:16,765
chasing dope and coke

173
00:11:17,152 --> 00:11:19,018
and maybe even
some hoppers, too.

174
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:21,786
You might at that.

175
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:26,009
But what happens when you turn
your district over to the next man?

176
00:11:26,243 --> 00:11:27,839
Or people get wind of this thing

177
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,871
and there's no one to defend it?

178
00:11:30,305 --> 00:11:30,938
What then?

179
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:36,299
How's the contrast on that?

180
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,367
Good for daylight.

181
00:11:37,484 --> 00:11:37,883
Yeah?

182
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:41,378
On a Sunday,
what the fuck, Lester?

183
00:11:42,387 --> 00:11:43,795
I could say the same of you.

184
00:11:44,886 --> 00:11:46,598
Elena's taking the kids
to her mother's

185
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,158
what the fuck else
am I gonna do?

186
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,402
No life

187
00:11:49,613 --> 00:11:51,207
no marriage, no kids.

188
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:53,341
No problem.

189
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:55,804
What's with the video?

190
00:11:56,755 --> 00:11:58,338
Gonna put it up
in one of the windows

191
00:11:58,362 --> 00:11:59,828
across from Stringer's print shop.

192
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:00,990
Catch him coming and going.

193
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:02,348
Hey, you need help?

194
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:03,779
You're a known face.

195
00:12:04,272 --> 00:12:06,219
I figure me and Prez
do it on a Sunday

196
00:12:06,348 --> 00:12:09,222
shop is closed, looking
like working men...

197
00:12:12,876 --> 00:12:14,024
you know something, Lester?

198
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,961
I do believe there
aren't five swingin' dicks

199
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:18,025
in this entire department
who can do what we do.

200
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:20,172
I'm not sayin' like
all chest out and shit.

201
00:12:20,195 --> 00:12:21,873
It's just, you think about it

202
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:24,841
there's maybe, what,
3,000 sworns, right?

203
00:12:25,615 --> 00:12:28,184
100 or so are bosses,
so not a fucking clue there?

204
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:31,023
A few more hundred is
sergeants and lieutenants

205
00:12:31,058 --> 00:12:32,782
and most of them
wanna be bosses one day

206
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:33,967
so they're just as fucked...

207
00:12:34,472 --> 00:12:38,143
then there's 600 or 700
fuckin' housecats, you know?

208
00:12:38,577 --> 00:12:39,410
Deskmen...

209
00:12:40,243 --> 00:12:41,451
and in the patrol division?

210
00:12:41,486 --> 00:12:43,703
There's probably a little
bit of talent there, but...

211
00:12:44,384 --> 00:12:47,397
the way the city is right now,
that's 1500 guys...

212
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,823
chasin' calls and clearin' corners...

213
00:12:51,524 --> 00:12:55,684
I mean, nobody's knowing his post,
nobody's building nothing, right?

214
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,538
And C.I.D. is the same.

215
00:12:59,004 --> 00:13:01,045
Catching calls,
chasing quick clearances

216
00:13:01,057 --> 00:13:02,817
keeping everything
in the shallow end...

217
00:13:02,828 --> 00:13:05,573
I mean who is it out there that
can do what we do with a case?

218
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:07,591
How many are there really?

219
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,735
Don Worden, Ed Burns.

220
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:12,318
Gary Childs out in the county

221
00:13:12,905 --> 00:13:15,276
John O'Neil and Steve Cleary
over at Woodlawn...

222
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:17,516
oh, they bring it in,
but there's not many.

223
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:18,994
There's not many.

224
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:21,364
We're good at this, Lester.

225
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,405
In this town, we're
as good as it gets.

226
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,331
Natural police.

227
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,677
Fuck yes, natural police.

228
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,202
Tell me something, Jimmy.

229
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:34,052
How exactly do you
think it all ends?

230
00:13:35,178 --> 00:13:35,964
What do you mean?

231
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:37,618
A parade?

232
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:39,225
A gold watch?

233
00:13:39,882 --> 00:13:42,603
A shining Jimmy-McNulty-day moment

234
00:13:43,014 --> 00:13:44,070
when you bring in a case

235
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:46,603
so sweet that everybody
gets together and says:

236
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:51,703
"Oh shit, he was right all along.
We shoulda listened to the man. "

237
00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:56,219
The job will not save you, Jimmy.

238
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,718
It won't make you whole,
it won't fill your ass up.

239
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,454
I dunno.

240
00:14:01,935 --> 00:14:03,343
- A good case...
- ends.

241
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:05,501
They all end.

242
00:14:06,838 --> 00:14:08,777
The handcuffs go
click and it's over

243
00:14:09,051 --> 00:14:11,597
and the next morning it's just
you in the room with yourself.

244
00:14:12,195 --> 00:14:13,392
Until the next case.

245
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,617
Boy, you need something
outside of this here.

246
00:14:21,006 --> 00:14:22,859
Like what?
Dollhouse miniatures?

247
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:28,457
A life, a life, Jimmy,
you know what that is?

248
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,278
It's the shit that happens
while you're waiting for moments

249
00:14:33,302 --> 00:14:34,017
that never come.

250
00:14:40,283 --> 00:14:41,538
On a Sunday morning...

251
00:14:41,784 --> 00:14:42,934
we called to ask.

252
00:14:43,427 --> 00:14:44,611
Shamrock said to go.

253
00:14:45,831 --> 00:14:47,262
On a Sunday morning

254
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,784
y'all try to hit a nigger

255
00:14:48,795 --> 00:14:51,337
when he takin' his
wrinkled-ass grandmoms to pray.

256
00:14:52,596 --> 00:14:54,485
And you all don't hit
the nigger, neither.

257
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:56,573
All y'all kill is
grandma's crown?

258
00:14:56,678 --> 00:14:59,564
By the time sham tells us to go,
omar's damn near in the cab...

259
00:14:59,623 --> 00:15:02,438
Ain't enough that y'all violated
the Sunday morning truce.

260
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,611
No!

261
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:06,977
I'm standin' here holdin'
a torn-up church crown

262
00:15:07,294 --> 00:15:09,089
of a bona-fide colored lady.

263
00:15:09,805 --> 00:15:11,530
Do you know what
a colored lady is?

264
00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:13,993
Not your mamas, for sure.

265
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,128
'Cause if they was that

266
00:15:16,222 --> 00:15:18,685
y'all would have known better
better than that bullshit.

267
00:15:20,261 --> 00:15:23,134
Y'all triflin' with Avon
Barksdale's reputation here.

268
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:24,871
You know that?

269
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,099
She alright though?

270
00:15:27,463 --> 00:15:29,328
She got cut on her
face from the glass

271
00:15:29,891 --> 00:15:31,575
an' she sore from
where I fell on her.

272
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:32,749
But other an' that though...

273
00:15:32,784 --> 00:15:33,839
you saved her ass, huh.

274
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:36,303
I damn near got
that woman kilt, yo.

275
00:15:37,098 --> 00:15:39,960
Y'all shoulda seen me in Sinai
hospital while they stitchin' her up

276
00:15:40,054 --> 00:15:42,695
lyin' about why somebody want
to shoot me down in the street.

277
00:15:42,904 --> 00:15:44,687
That woman thinks
I work in a cafeteria.

278
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:45,731
Cafeteria?

279
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:47,021
At the airport, yeah.

280
00:15:47,162 --> 00:15:48,496
Airport, why the airport?

281
00:15:48,543 --> 00:15:50,655
'Cause I know she ain't
never gonna go down there

282
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,828
to go dining that's why.

283
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:54,936
Yo, Kimmy, this ain't funny, yo.
That woman raised me.

284
00:15:55,511 --> 00:15:57,517
An for as long as I've been
grown, once a month

285
00:15:57,552 --> 00:15:59,152
I been with her on a church Sunday.

286
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,911
Tellin' myself ain't
no need to worry

287
00:16:00,923 --> 00:16:02,600
'cause there's ain't
nobody in this city

288
00:16:02,624 --> 00:16:04,970
that low-down to disrespect
a Sunday morning.

289
00:16:10,826 --> 00:16:12,620
Y'all know I was gonna
walk away, right?

290
00:16:13,008 --> 00:16:14,063
Y'all knew that, right?

291
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:17,113
I mean, after Tosha, I was
gonna leave them people be, yo.

292
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,333
Avon home now.

293
00:16:18,368 --> 00:16:19,811
Oh, Barksdale's gots to go.

294
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:22,009
Stringer too.
This thing got to end, man.

295
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:25,646
I swear to god, yo,
on a Sunday morning

296
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:27,710
they near shot her
best crown off, yo.

297
00:16:28,332 --> 00:16:30,643
I mean, no shame them
niggers. Y'all feel me?

298
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:34,835
I'm out.

299
00:16:40,653 --> 00:16:43,247
If you back to dealin' with
Barksdale people, I'm out, yo.

300
00:16:45,898 --> 00:16:47,024
I'm in it for the money.

301
00:16:47,963 --> 00:16:49,276
It's easier out there than that.

302
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:00,969
Jus' you an' me then.

303
00:17:01,591 --> 00:17:02,623
Like it was.

304
00:17:05,964 --> 00:17:06,715
Naw, yo.

305
00:17:07,372 --> 00:17:08,404
This one about me.

306
00:17:10,222 --> 00:17:11,196
And nobody else.

307
00:17:11,794 --> 00:17:12,228
Hey...

308
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:14,492
I'm with you.

309
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,474
Not on this one you ain't.

310
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:27,926
Okay, guys.

311
00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:29,661
We are maybe a step and a half away

312
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:31,551
from being up on a
wire on these people.

313
00:17:31,703 --> 00:17:33,438
All we need is to firm up the P.C.

314
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:36,313
showing the disposable phones
are being used in a drug conspiracy.

315
00:17:36,908 --> 00:17:39,008
McNulty and Greggs,
you're on that angle.

316
00:17:39,078 --> 00:17:41,413
You need to walk either
undercover or a wired C.I.

317
00:17:41,471 --> 00:17:42,902
up to one of the Barksdale crews...

318
00:17:42,949 --> 00:17:45,530
Lester, you and Prez
start typing affidavits

319
00:17:45,952 --> 00:17:47,685
because when the probable
cause comes in

320
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,878
we're going to want to get
the application in fast.

321
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,729
Detective, you're the chaser
on our boy Bernard.

322
00:17:53,034 --> 00:17:55,356
When he goes out for cell
phones, we're right behind.

323
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:57,452
The faster we get a hold
of the new numbers

324
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,153
the faster we're up
on those phones.

325
00:17:59,963 --> 00:18:01,828
Now, when Caroline
comes back off vacation

326
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,329
she's going to be on the mini-cam.

327
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:04,737
From here on out

328
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:07,349
we keep a log on any
movement by Stringer

329
00:18:07,361 --> 00:18:09,495
and we keep an eye out
for Mr. Barksdale as well.

330
00:18:09,613 --> 00:18:11,759
Try to get a line on where
he spends his days.

331
00:18:11,865 --> 00:18:14,821
As for me, I'm off to do battle
with the wireless company.

332
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:15,700
They a problem?

333
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,257
Have been since the damn
things were invented.

334
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:19,900
Okay, then.

335
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:21,870
Remember that with this wire

336
00:18:21,952 --> 00:18:23,642
everything is a race
against the clock.

337
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:25,929
Anything we get up on
is only temporary.

338
00:18:28,246 --> 00:18:29,325
You reach Bubbles?

339
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:31,472
Yeah. He'll be waiting
at Mount Clare.

340
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:34,029
Lee, where's the DNR log?

341
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:34,897
What?

342
00:18:35,343 --> 00:18:36,141
The log.

343
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:39,069
Never mind, I got it right here.

344
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,215
All Stringer, all the time.

345
00:18:45,178 --> 00:18:46,843
Theresa D'Agostino please.

346
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:47,688
<i>Hold please. </i>

347
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:48,814
Yeah, I'll hold.

348
00:18:50,386 --> 00:18:52,075
<i>I'm sorry, she's not
in the office now. </i>

349
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:53,307
<i>You want to leave a message?</i>

350
00:18:53,334 --> 00:18:54,366
No, I left one already.

351
00:19:11,428 --> 00:19:12,167
A boxing gym?

352
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:14,243
For kids an' all. An athletic club.

353
00:19:14,478 --> 00:19:17,581
Gyms, reducing salons,
public baths are permitted

354
00:19:17,593 --> 00:19:22,766
only in properties zoned
b- two, b-three, b-four or b-five...

355
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:25,828
all signed and sealed by a
registered architect and engineer...

356
00:19:25,863 --> 00:19:28,620
floor framing plan,
including the load criteria...

357
00:19:28,632 --> 00:19:30,556
hydronic piping
and equipment layouts...

358
00:19:30,591 --> 00:19:32,421
six copies of your
fire protection plan

359
00:19:32,432 --> 00:19:34,896
with emergency exits
and sprinkler system...

360
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,989
health department, since it's a
physical culture and health service...

361
00:19:38,012 --> 00:19:40,914
a license from the State Athletic
Commission, up on Calvert Street.

362
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,686
Mid-size or full?

363
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:51,460
Mid-sized.

364
00:19:52,152 --> 00:19:54,451
You should upgrade an' get
one of them escalades.

365
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:56,269
They got that XM radio an' all...

366
00:19:57,504 --> 00:19:59,897
I'm sayin' if we gonna be
in the damn car all damn day

367
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,539
it's worth it, Bernard.

368
00:20:27,974 --> 00:20:29,021
You ticklish, bubs?

369
00:20:29,913 --> 00:20:30,828
Chills, Kima.

370
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:32,541
You do that to me.

371
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,825
Here's the buy money, Bubs.

372
00:20:36,587 --> 00:20:38,042
Remember, this is all on tape.

373
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,238
I hear you.

374
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:40,698
So down there on Vincent Street

375
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:42,692
they don't even hide
the ground stash anymore.

376
00:20:42,715 --> 00:20:45,050
You watch and wait,
see when they're runnin' low.

377
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:46,973
Then ask for 30 or so.

378
00:20:47,091 --> 00:20:49,319
Enough so that they have
to call for a quick re-up.

379
00:20:49,343 --> 00:20:50,457
That's the important thing.

380
00:20:50,528 --> 00:20:52,059
We want him to use his burner.

381
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:54,053
I get to keep the 30?

382
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,414
30 would kill you, Bubs.

383
00:20:56,024 --> 00:20:57,056
You get to keep the money

384
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,649
we hand you once you come back
here with all of that product.

385
00:20:59,672 --> 00:21:00,810
Just asking.

386
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:01,889
Just telling.

387
00:21:07,203 --> 00:21:07,930
It can't be done.

388
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,217
Excuse me?

389
00:21:10,745 --> 00:21:12,724
The activation information
you're gonna want?

390
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,159
That stuff's not accessible
from the business office

391
00:21:15,168 --> 00:21:16,201
until it goes to billing

392
00:21:16,548 --> 00:21:19,023
and that takes a few days,
sometimes a week or more.

393
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:22,202
But more than that,
we have dozens of

394
00:21:22,226 --> 00:21:23,923
law enforcement
inquiries every month.

395
00:21:24,322 --> 00:21:26,022
We get to them
in the order received

396
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,070
and currently the
turnaround's 30 days.

397
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:29,107
30 days.

398
00:21:29,565 --> 00:21:30,937
Let me understand something.

399
00:21:31,383 --> 00:21:34,672
Your company is in business
selling disposable cell phones

400
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:37,335
to people who don't have to give
any subscriber information

401
00:21:37,358 --> 00:21:38,989
at the time of purchase, correct?

402
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:39,798
Correct.

403
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,203
They buy these phones
and as far as you're concerned

404
00:21:42,226 --> 00:21:45,100
they use them anonymously,
prepaying for their minutes...

405
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,645
From the retailers, yes.

406
00:21:46,656 --> 00:21:48,850
And while they are using
these phones, anonymously

407
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:50,305
for whatever purpose

408
00:21:50,469 --> 00:21:52,463
they can't be monitored
by law enforcement

409
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:54,990
because your company
can't react within a month

410
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:56,832
to a court order for a wiretap.

411
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:58,228
We do the best we can.

412
00:21:58,474 --> 00:21:59,483
This is bullshit.

413
00:22:00,456 --> 00:22:03,424
You're selling a phone that you know
is effective for drug trafficking.

414
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:06,779
Lieutenant, our prepaid inventory
is there for young people

415
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:08,468
college students and such

416
00:22:08,504 --> 00:22:10,732
people who can't afford
a permanent cell phone plan.

417
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:12,879
What college student
can't afford a cell phone?

418
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,693
They can afford
the fucking college

419
00:22:14,717 --> 00:22:16,558
they can afford the phone
that goes with it.

420
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,567
I resent the suggestion.

421
00:22:17,591 --> 00:22:18,682
Just so I'm clear:

422
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:21,380
You're telling me that
even if by some miracle

423
00:22:21,391 --> 00:22:24,847
we are able to get up on a drug
dealer's disposable cell phone

424
00:22:24,848 --> 00:22:26,267
in time to catch him talking

425
00:22:26,701 --> 00:22:29,716
you're gonna take as much
as a month to activate our tap.

426
00:22:30,138 --> 00:22:31,752
Look, if you have
a problem with that

427
00:22:31,753 --> 00:22:33,663
your office can contact
our general counsel.

428
00:22:33,771 --> 00:22:34,686
That's all I can say.

429
00:22:38,228 --> 00:22:39,225
How about this?

430
00:22:39,648 --> 00:22:41,697
How about the state's attorney
for Baltimore city

431
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:43,762
calls a press conference
on the courthouse steps

432
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:47,070
to declare that Bay Wireless is
in league with the most violent

433
00:22:47,152 --> 00:22:48,571
drug traffickers in the city

434
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:51,915
preventing their apprehension
and arrest by law enforcement.

435
00:22:56,138 --> 00:22:57,393
Four to five days turnaround.

436
00:22:57,733 --> 00:22:58,695
Best we can do.

437
00:23:00,883 --> 00:23:04,862
I swear, I felt like a damn balloon
with air rushin' out my ass

438
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:06,135
goin' from desk to desk.

439
00:23:08,891 --> 00:23:10,099
This our new man, huh?

440
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:11,399
Frank Reid.

441
00:23:11,728 --> 00:23:12,725
Dennis Wise.

442
00:23:13,065 --> 00:23:14,800
Reverend, our man
Dennis spent all day

443
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:16,901
down at the Benton building,
trying for permits.

444
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,074
On the new gym?

445
00:23:18,449 --> 00:23:18,813
Yeah.

446
00:23:19,587 --> 00:23:20,631
You use my name?

447
00:23:22,132 --> 00:23:23,516
You use anybody's name?

448
00:23:24,067 --> 00:23:26,765
Hell, man. There was a time
I'da used Smith and Wesson.

449
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:29,874
Naw, look, man,
I'm just sayin'...

450
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:32,056
how do regular folk
get it done in this town?

451
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,630
Doreen

452
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:41,223
ring Delegate Watkins, please?

453
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,141
<i>Yellow tops, yellow tops. </i>

454
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,572
Obliged, man, obliged.

455
00:24:05,209 --> 00:24:06,405
Keep me close, you know?

456
00:24:07,121 --> 00:24:08,305
You tell a friend, okay?

457
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:10,499
Too hot for them
black tees, right?

458
00:24:11,766 --> 00:24:13,129
Sup, hopper, what you hawkin'?

459
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:13,983
Body bags.

460
00:24:14,604 --> 00:24:16,211
Alright, let me get 30... 30 pills.

461
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,471
30?

462
00:24:19,961 --> 00:24:22,412
Where the fuck your raggedy-ass
come up with three-hunnert

463
00:24:22,424 --> 00:24:23,620
in motherfucking cash, man?

464
00:24:23,644 --> 00:24:25,626
I've been sellin' them
t- shirts for weeks now.

465
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:28,008
You know, I might be raggedy,
but I'm in a cash business.

466
00:24:28,031 --> 00:24:29,110
You want my money or no?

467
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:38,553
Yeah, we out.

468
00:24:40,224 --> 00:24:40,529
A- ight.

469
00:24:42,804 --> 00:24:43,626
Shouldn't be long.

470
00:24:44,505 --> 00:24:46,769
A bulk purchase justify
a discount, right?

471
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:48,760
250 or so...

472
00:24:50,132 --> 00:24:50,989
275.

473
00:24:51,563 --> 00:24:52,807
And a couple of them whiteys.

474
00:24:52,912 --> 00:24:53,616
That'll work.

475
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:55,470
<i>That'll work. </i>

476
00:24:55,505 --> 00:24:57,065
Bubs just made another 25.

477
00:24:58,253 --> 00:24:59,449
Theresa D'Agostino, please.

478
00:24:59,778 --> 00:25:02,194
<i>I'm sorry, but she's not in.
Can I take a message?</i>

479
00:25:02,499 --> 00:25:04,129
No, I'll call back.

480
00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:09,314
- So, how's that working?
- What?

481
00:25:10,436 --> 00:25:11,163
Your new hope.

482
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:13,591
So far, so good.

483
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:31,576
You got the receipts, man?

484
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,491
Yeah, most of 'em.

485
00:25:32,503 --> 00:25:34,615
A few blew out the damn
window on the interstate.

486
00:25:35,729 --> 00:25:37,101
What, y'all waiting to see Avon?

487
00:25:37,441 --> 00:25:39,952
I heard y'all shot a crown off
an ol' lady's head yesterday.

488
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:47,602
Good, you all made it.

489
00:25:48,623 --> 00:25:49,280
Yeah...

490
00:25:50,335 --> 00:25:51,379
we puttin' in some work.

491
00:25:51,473 --> 00:25:52,764
C'mon upstairs so we can talk.

492
00:26:02,277 --> 00:26:03,356
Back with numbers.

493
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:03,872
How many?

494
00:26:04,694 --> 00:26:06,137
24 Trac phones.

495
00:26:06,336 --> 00:26:09,234
Two each from Mondo Marts
in Catonsville and Sykesville

496
00:26:09,316 --> 00:26:10,641
and four from Frederick

497
00:26:10,677 --> 00:26:13,832
and then eight each from two stops
over the river in west Virginia.

498
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:15,967
Those bumper beepers?

499
00:26:17,011 --> 00:26:18,044
They work great.

500
00:26:18,982 --> 00:26:20,636
He went out I-70 this time.

501
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:22,665
Can you blame him?
The scenery's better.

502
00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:24,283
24.

503
00:26:26,414 --> 00:26:28,021
We're gonna have
a lot of D.N.R.'s up.

504
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:29,393
But with any luck

505
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:31,974
one of these phones leads
to young Mr. Bodie Broadus.

506
00:26:33,065 --> 00:26:34,190
You want to call Pearlman.

507
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:34,637
A'ight.

508
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:36,947
Who's hungry?

509
00:26:37,246 --> 00:26:38,525
How 'bout chinese?

510
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:39,745
Sounds good to me.

511
00:26:40,425 --> 00:26:41,809
You guys call it in and I'll go.

512
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,193
Let me get some of that lo mein.

513
00:26:43,217 --> 00:26:45,387
You take a turn typing
this shit, I'll go with him.

514
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,454
Make mine sweet and sour.

515
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:47,252
Lo mein for me.

516
00:26:53,076 --> 00:26:54,214
So y'all get with Charles

517
00:26:54,284 --> 00:26:56,000
he gonna get you
all the details on it.

518
00:26:59,470 --> 00:26:59,998
Who they?

519
00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:01,899
Eastside niggas.

520
00:27:01,946 --> 00:27:03,658
Willing to soldier up
for us on retainer.

521
00:27:04,984 --> 00:27:06,297
Milton put me up on them.

522
00:27:07,858 --> 00:27:09,863
Man, we gonna be back
where we was, String.

523
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:12,583
You know, I can smell it.
We just got to get this boy Marlo

524
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:14,332
and then we spread out like we do.

525
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,895
Them co-op boys, man, they ain't
happy about this situation, man.

526
00:27:19,446 --> 00:27:22,869
They say they got cops on corners
where they wouldn't have otherwise.

527
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:23,912
Everybody nervous.

528
00:27:23,923 --> 00:27:25,237
Man, fuck them niggers.

529
00:27:25,507 --> 00:27:27,278
I mean, Prop Joe said he'd mediate.

530
00:27:27,501 --> 00:27:29,624
You know what I mean?
Go to Marlo and talk on it.

531
00:27:29,653 --> 00:27:32,033
Yeah, well, he take a gun
with him, maybe it could work.

532
00:27:32,034 --> 00:27:33,395
Lemme ask you, something though.

533
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:35,130
Did you tell them
discount ass niggers

534
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:36,891
they could pop off
at Omar's grandma.

535
00:27:36,996 --> 00:27:37,595
Oh, man.

536
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,894
Sham comes to me
in the middle of the meeting

537
00:27:39,905 --> 00:27:41,949
and talk about they got
their sights on Omar.

538
00:27:42,653 --> 00:27:46,195
They say nothing about no grandma.
No church hat, nothing like that.

539
00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:48,127
I hear the cocksucker's
name, I say, "go. "

540
00:27:48,412 --> 00:27:49,480
On a Sunday morning?

541
00:27:49,526 --> 00:27:52,209
Yo, I don't give a fuck, man.
I hear that cocksucker's name, man

542
00:27:52,232 --> 00:27:53,827
I ain't thinkin'
about a church day.

543
00:27:53,863 --> 00:27:56,584
A Sunday truce been around
long as the game itself, man.

544
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:58,907
I mean, you know what I'm sayin',
you can do some shit

545
00:27:58,915 --> 00:28:02,504
and be like what the fuck, but hey,
just never on no Sunday, man.

546
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:06,328
I mean, it's just like people
was talkin' on us and all

547
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,346
and the stories are
getting bigger and bigger.

548
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,281
Like, I swear to god, Fatface Rick
heard that our people went an' shot

549
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:14,014
Omar granny's in the ass
on purpose, and all that.

550
00:28:14,084 --> 00:28:16,759
And pulled their dicks out and
pissed on her crown an' shit.

551
00:28:18,577 --> 00:28:19,926
I heard the same bullshit.

552
00:28:20,483 --> 00:28:23,252
Prop Joe gave me an earful.
But yo, what can I say, man?

553
00:28:23,275 --> 00:28:24,378
Good help is hard to find.

554
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:27,099
If it wasn't, you think I'd be
payin' Eastside niggers for shit?

555
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,108
Yo, we still off them corners?

556
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:33,407
Yeah, got to be.

557
00:28:34,744 --> 00:28:36,973
We be off them corners
till we take care of Marlo.

558
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:39,984
Yeah, maybe we should
put a couple more crews

559
00:28:39,995 --> 00:28:41,778
on them free zones them cops got.

560
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,652
You know what I mean?
Take the profit where we can.

561
00:28:44,664 --> 00:28:45,555
You trust that shit?

562
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,677
I mean, so far.

563
00:28:48,158 --> 00:28:49,261
An' if they runnin' a game

564
00:28:49,284 --> 00:28:51,489
they ain't gonna get nobody
higher than a crew chief

565
00:28:51,513 --> 00:28:52,967
to take a charge, right?

566
00:28:55,219 --> 00:28:56,944
What you gonna do
with them two niggers

567
00:28:56,956 --> 00:28:58,117
you got waitin' downstairs?

568
00:28:58,943 --> 00:29:00,585
I make 'em buy the lady a new hat.

569
00:29:03,131 --> 00:29:04,245
What're we waiting for?

570
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:05,864
Sweet-and-sour?

571
00:29:10,437 --> 00:29:11,751
You do the cookie first?

572
00:29:14,073 --> 00:29:15,012
What's the difference?

573
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,209
"A new friend makes himself known. "

574
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:27,397
Himself?

575
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,785
If it was herself,
then you'd have a fortune.

576
00:29:35,096 --> 00:29:37,513
Shit, I'm married with
lawn furniture, man.

577
00:29:41,653 --> 00:29:43,964
This technology's out
of control no question.

578
00:29:44,128 --> 00:29:45,465
But that's nothing new.

579
00:29:45,477 --> 00:29:48,104
The way these guys are
using disposables nowadays

580
00:29:48,116 --> 00:29:50,861
we cannot get
a working wire up in time.

581
00:29:51,002 --> 00:29:53,596
By the time we get subscriber
information and papers served...

582
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,687
they're dumping phones.

583
00:29:54,699 --> 00:29:57,033
Cellular carrier is telling them
they need nearly a week

584
00:29:57,057 --> 00:29:58,112
to process the paperwork.

585
00:29:58,124 --> 00:30:01,279
They're only half-scared of us,
but a visit from the feds?

586
00:30:01,631 --> 00:30:03,777
You all have profile
enough to push them.

587
00:30:04,211 --> 00:30:06,791
I dunno. If you've got
them down to five days

588
00:30:07,249 --> 00:30:08,903
you're doing about
as well as we can.

589
00:30:09,255 --> 00:30:10,252
Once again, guys:

590
00:30:10,545 --> 00:30:12,715
The bureau's a little busy
with counter terrorism.

591
00:30:12,997 --> 00:30:14,389
Our U.S. attorney here

592
00:30:14,448 --> 00:30:17,064
he only touches himself at the
mention of political corruption.

593
00:30:17,205 --> 00:30:19,210
Ghetto drug stuff
just doesn't rate.

594
00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:21,615
I'm sorry to say.

595
00:30:25,673 --> 00:30:27,819
Shit always smells best
in the car, going home.

596
00:30:28,946 --> 00:30:29,942
<i>Signal 13.</i>

597
00:30:29,943 --> 00:30:33,462
<i>In the alley in the rear,
Eastside, 800 north Montford. </i>

598
00:30:33,503 --> 00:30:34,969
That's five blocks,
up and over.

599
00:30:34,981 --> 00:30:35,379
Go.

600
00:31:10,462 --> 00:31:12,586
<i>What's the cross street?
What's the cross street?</i>

601
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:17,078
<i>Shots fired. </i>

602
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,234
<i>Sounded like it was
west of Milton... </i>

603
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:45,817
I'm police.

604
00:31:47,342 --> 00:31:48,644
He's ten-seven, call it in.

605
00:31:58,432 --> 00:31:59,171
That's a glock.

606
00:32:13,101 --> 00:32:14,661
I saw the gun as he turned.

607
00:32:15,446 --> 00:32:16,326
It's Derrick.

608
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:18,109
Jesus christ.

609
00:32:18,941 --> 00:32:19,798
You killed Derrick.

610
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,721
It's Waggoner.

611
00:32:22,742 --> 00:32:24,161
You fuckin' killed Waggoner!

612
00:32:34,164 --> 00:32:34,880
Greggs.

613
00:32:34,903 --> 00:32:35,971
<i>Prez shot another cop. </i>

614
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:37,809
What?

615
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:40,695
<i>It was an accident in
an alley, a little while ago. </i>

616
00:32:40,718 --> 00:32:42,249
- No.
- <i>I'll call you back. </i>

617
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:53,156
You here for Barksdale?

618
00:32:53,274 --> 00:32:54,634
I'm here for peace, man.

619
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:56,816
This some senseless shit goin' on.

620
00:32:56,898 --> 00:32:58,153
But Barksdale ain't sent you?

621
00:32:58,165 --> 00:32:59,772
Naw, Stringer knows I'm here, man.

622
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,871
If I can bring something
respectful back

623
00:33:01,872 --> 00:33:03,432
they most likely to show the same.

624
00:33:05,238 --> 00:33:07,173
Tell the boy he can
come in with the co-op.

625
00:33:07,678 --> 00:33:09,503
If he takes our package,
which by the way

626
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:11,557
is better than the best
he putting out there now

627
00:33:12,566 --> 00:33:13,727
he'll keep his corners.

628
00:33:13,985 --> 00:33:14,677
Guaranteed.

629
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,050
He might listen.

630
00:33:16,836 --> 00:33:18,161
But the boy got ideas.

631
00:33:18,794 --> 00:33:20,729
And he's thinkin'
Avon weak right now.

632
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:24,577
You ever know Avon Barksdale
to back down from anything?

633
00:33:36,954 --> 00:33:39,499
A plainclothesman in a dark alley

634
00:33:39,994 --> 00:33:42,587
with his gun out,
and shots fired...

635
00:33:42,657 --> 00:33:45,109
Look, no one wants to burn
anybody, but the fact is

636
00:33:45,132 --> 00:33:46,833
there's a racial
component to consider.

637
00:33:47,701 --> 00:33:49,848
- The appearance of it...
- Has he seen a lawyer?

638
00:33:59,001 --> 00:33:59,720
Lieutenant...

639
00:34:00,993 --> 00:34:01,356
What?

640
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,512
He's in a situation where
you can't compel a statement

641
00:34:04,524 --> 00:34:06,213
out of him until you
read him his rights

642
00:34:06,236 --> 00:34:07,761
and we haven't
done that yet, so...

643
00:34:07,785 --> 00:34:10,482
I'm his commanding officer.
I just want to know if he's alright.

644
00:34:10,658 --> 00:34:11,046
Okay.

645
00:34:12,494 --> 00:34:13,596
Okay, there's just...

646
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:16,928
it's a legal question
at this point.

647
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:32,952
Can I get you anything?

648
00:34:41,654 --> 00:34:43,132
You should call the union, Roland.

649
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,002
Talk to a lawyer before
you say anything further.

650
00:34:49,735 --> 00:34:52,515
I'm not saying anyone's gonna
charge anything criminally.

651
00:34:53,688 --> 00:34:55,529
Everyone knows you had
no intention of...

652
00:34:58,482 --> 00:34:59,667
but administratively...

653
00:35:00,945 --> 00:35:03,420
you need to be careful
because of the racial thing.

654
00:35:03,585 --> 00:35:04,523
You see that, right?

655
00:35:06,212 --> 00:35:09,064
There's gonna be people in the
department who see this that way.

656
00:35:14,272 --> 00:35:15,257
You see that, right?

657
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:17,566
I wasn't scared, I wasn't angry.

658
00:35:21,108 --> 00:35:23,443
I didn't give a shit
he was black or...

659
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,085
whatever...

660
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:34,151
or, maybe I did.

661
00:35:35,124 --> 00:35:37,975
How the fuck do you know if
that's in your head or if it's not...

662
00:35:39,652 --> 00:35:40,567
But you saw the gun.

663
00:35:42,127 --> 00:35:42,503
Yeah.

664
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:44,837
Yeah...

665
00:35:45,787 --> 00:35:47,077
He turned toward me and...

666
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,149
'Cause you shouted, right?

667
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:52,437
You shouted, "police"
and he turned, right?

668
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,991
I don't think so.
I don't think I said anything.

669
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,486
I don't think he did that.

670
00:36:02,674 --> 00:36:04,480
I was a couple steps in the alley...

671
00:36:05,501 --> 00:36:07,284
and he turned and I saw the gun.

672
00:36:07,413 --> 00:36:08,293
That's all.

673
00:36:11,354 --> 00:36:12,203
He have kids?

674
00:36:13,646 --> 00:36:14,232
A wife?

675
00:36:14,901 --> 00:36:15,569
I don't know.

676
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:18,912
They won't say.
They won't talk to me about him.

677
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:20,414
Call the F.O.P.

678
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:22,080
Get a lawyer, Roland.

679
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,326
No, sir.

680
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:28,341
I'm done.

681
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,488
Let the lawyer talk for you.

682
00:36:48,611 --> 00:36:49,378
Lieutenant...

683
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,268
tell Lester I'm sorry.

684
00:37:11,384 --> 00:37:12,251
Call the union.

685
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,807
He wants a lawyer
in there with him.

686
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,955
Whenever he's done here, you need
to send someone home with him.

687
00:37:24,736 --> 00:37:26,682
For tonight at least,
he's a suicide watch.

688
00:37:30,104 --> 00:37:30,601
Lieutenant

689
00:37:32,323 --> 00:37:33,133
you'll back him.

690
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:41,581
What I mean is, if this thing
should turn into some kind of

691
00:37:41,582 --> 00:37:44,210
a black-white thing,
you're his unit commander

692
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:46,924
he can count on you, right?

693
00:37:58,375 --> 00:37:59,085
Are you alright?

694
00:38:04,524 --> 00:38:05,234
Lo mein.

695
00:38:14,117 --> 00:38:15,778
What a clusterfuck.

696
00:38:17,156 --> 00:38:18,675
How many years on for Waggoner?

697
00:38:19,485 --> 00:38:20,522
Six and a half.

698
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:24,927
Two commendations, 16th
on the current sergeant's list.

699
00:38:25,588 --> 00:38:28,301
Pretty much the exact opposite
of that goof in there...

700
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,226
you know what's
in that guy's jacket?

701
00:38:32,348 --> 00:38:35,698
Motherfucker flaked out,
shot up his own radio car.

702
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,382
They were gonna charge
him with false report

703
00:38:38,397 --> 00:38:39,590
until Valchek weighed in...

704
00:38:42,657 --> 00:38:44,802
You know he married
Valchek's daughter, right?

705
00:38:47,852 --> 00:38:50,025
Fuckin' goof had nine
lives behind that shit...

706
00:39:20,144 --> 00:39:23,581
Eight up, and the rest
still to be activated

707
00:39:23,602 --> 00:39:25,973
whenever the cellular company
gets to our subpoenas.

708
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,637
You did good, detective.

709
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:34,111
So we're looking for what?

710
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,052
Looking for one of these phones

711
00:39:36,053 --> 00:39:38,013
to give us signature
on our man, Bodie.

712
00:39:38,939 --> 00:39:41,250
Calls to his girlfriend,
his grandmother...

713
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:44,020
the numbers we pulled
off the burners.

714
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,309
We see that,
we know it's his phone.

715
00:39:46,966 --> 00:39:50,392
We know it's his phone, we
know he uses it to sell drugs.

716
00:39:51,048 --> 00:39:52,046
We know all that.

717
00:39:53,632 --> 00:39:55,308
We get a tap up and pray like hell

718
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,385
he doesn't throw it
away anytime soon.

719
00:40:00,388 --> 00:40:01,420
Prez would love this...

720
00:40:05,525 --> 00:40:06,756
Ain't gonna lie to y'all.

721
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:09,524
I don't know about nothing
except the boxing part.

722
00:40:10,216 --> 00:40:11,378
That's all I was thinkin'.

723
00:40:13,647 --> 00:40:14,398
Were you a pug?

724
00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:16,193
Yeah, I was.

725
00:40:16,744 --> 00:40:18,398
I got sidetracked, though.

726
00:40:18,797 --> 00:40:20,821
Well, reverend Reid
seems to think you'd

727
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:24,223
be quite a draw for some of
these corner kids that we got.

728
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:27,754
They didn't think so downtown?

729
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:31,128
Well, the fact is

730
00:40:32,547 --> 00:40:34,976
you're looking to put your
gym in the fourth district

731
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:37,638
so your council person
would be Eunetta Perkins.

732
00:40:38,143 --> 00:40:39,175
Do you know Ms. Perkins?

733
00:40:40,711 --> 00:40:43,116
Well, few of us do anymore.
Few of us do.

734
00:40:45,603 --> 00:40:48,547
Well, since we can't
really rely on Ms. Perkins,

735
00:40:48,577 --> 00:40:50,421
Ms. Daniels here
will go with you.

736
00:40:50,609 --> 00:40:52,825
She's here because
constituent service

737
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:54,750
is the life of a city
council person.

738
00:40:55,512 --> 00:40:56,920
She needs to get a taste of that.

739
00:40:56,932 --> 00:40:57,952
At least I hope I do.

740
00:40:58,574 --> 00:41:00,316
If you don't mind me
asking, Mr. Watkins.

741
00:41:01,172 --> 00:41:02,286
Why are you doing this?

742
00:41:02,451 --> 00:41:04,081
Do you know who reverend Reid is?

743
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:06,802
Well, the voters in my district do.

744
00:41:11,243 --> 00:41:12,064
This came today?

745
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,885
Well, I see, this is fucked up.

746
00:41:16,955 --> 00:41:19,962
I give you a quarter million dollars
to have them tell me my paperwork

747
00:41:19,973 --> 00:41:22,365
is insufficient enough to certify
me as a developer

748
00:41:22,366 --> 00:41:23,989
in the empowerment zone?
Yeah...

749
00:41:24,423 --> 00:41:25,831
Yeah, you could call it fucked up.

750
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,696
Look, I know we touched
the right people.

751
00:41:28,036 --> 00:41:30,210
Just lemme get with them,
clear this mess right up.

752
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:30,896
Get with 'em.

753
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:32,483
Hey, I'm on it, String.

754
00:41:32,917 --> 00:41:34,676
You got the lightbulb
franchise, right?

755
00:41:34,688 --> 00:41:35,674
That came through...

756
00:41:36,049 --> 00:41:36,413
now...

757
00:41:36,436 --> 00:41:38,231
I'm not talkin' about
30,000 coming back.

758
00:41:38,242 --> 00:41:40,573
I'm talkin' about the quarter
of a mill that you took.

759
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:43,224
Now, you need to call
Mr. Goose, Mr. Faucet

760
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:46,073
whoever the fuck you gotta call
because I gave you money to run

761
00:41:46,074 --> 00:41:46,719
remember that?

762
00:41:46,743 --> 00:41:48,631
It ain't like no
drug deal, String.

763
00:41:48,948 --> 00:41:51,043
Hell, man, you don't put
your money on the street

764
00:41:51,066 --> 00:41:53,306
and have it come right back.
It don't work like that.

765
00:41:53,307 --> 00:41:54,234
Oh, it don't, huh?

766
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:55,582
Patience, my man.

767
00:41:56,896 --> 00:41:58,245
Sometimes with the bureaucracy

768
00:41:58,867 --> 00:42:01,139
the one hand don't know
what the other is all about.

769
00:42:01,163 --> 00:42:02,570
Yeah, well, you know what I see?

770
00:42:02,676 --> 00:42:03,954
I see one hand in my pocket

771
00:42:04,377 --> 00:42:06,734
while the other hand seems
to have grabbed your dick.

772
00:42:12,627 --> 00:42:13,835
Fucking Prez.

773
00:42:17,425 --> 00:42:19,055
I don't even feel like working.

774
00:42:21,907 --> 00:42:22,916
Sanny, baby.

775
00:42:22,928 --> 00:42:24,324
Welcome to the western, guys.

776
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,646
That thing with Pryzbylewski?

777
00:42:27,538 --> 00:42:28,629
Jesus christ.

778
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:31,186
So fucking sad, man.

779
00:42:32,253 --> 00:42:33,485
So you humpin' a wagon, huh?

780
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:34,623
Fuck yes.

781
00:42:35,292 --> 00:42:36,652
How's that working out for you?

782
00:42:37,063 --> 00:42:38,576
Jimmy, I love this fucking gig.

783
00:42:39,913 --> 00:42:42,914
Best thing Rawls ever did for me
was to knock me back to a district.

784
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:44,803
No stress, no struggle.

785
00:42:45,014 --> 00:42:46,093
I work eight-hour shifts.

786
00:42:46,234 --> 00:42:47,477
I take nothing home with me.

787
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:49,213
Really, I couldn't be happier.

788
00:42:49,671 --> 00:42:51,829
All those years knockin'
my head against a wall

789
00:42:51,852 --> 00:42:52,920
in homicide and for what?

790
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,611
The same fuckin' pension
with twice the heartburn.

791
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:59,027
Well, I'm glad you landed
on your feet, Mike.

792
00:43:05,321 --> 00:43:05,967
Hello.

793
00:43:06,013 --> 00:43:07,069
<i>You called my office. </i>

794
00:43:07,761 --> 00:43:09,063
Yeah, I did, several times.

795
00:43:09,251 --> 00:43:09,967
<i>Really, why?</i>

796
00:43:10,659 --> 00:43:11,480
Why do you think?

797
00:43:11,949 --> 00:43:14,260
<i>A sleep over.
You want to get dinner first. </i>

798
00:43:14,327 --> 00:43:15,160
How about tonight?

799
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,764
<i>Georgia Browns near 15th Street. </i>

800
00:43:17,835 --> 00:43:18,421
That'll work.

801
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,204
You want me to make a reservation?

802
00:43:20,462 --> 00:43:22,022
<i>No, I can always get a table there. </i>

803
00:43:22,046 --> 00:43:22,904
Alright, whatever.

804
00:43:22,927 --> 00:43:24,100
<i>Let's shoot for 7:30.</i>

805
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,341
I'll see you then.

806
00:43:26,939 --> 00:43:27,690
- <i>Bye. </i>
- Bye.

807
00:43:30,681 --> 00:43:31,350
You in?

808
00:43:33,496 --> 00:43:34,389
What do you think?

809
00:43:35,051 --> 00:43:36,130
Nice colors.

810
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,230
You got a platform?

811
00:43:38,675 --> 00:43:39,379
Schools.

812
00:43:40,001 --> 00:43:41,479
Thought I'd be the education mayor.

813
00:43:42,136 --> 00:43:43,227
Well, good luck, Tony.

814
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:45,206
I mean it.

815
00:43:45,429 --> 00:43:46,227
Thanks, man.

816
00:43:47,165 --> 00:43:48,303
When do you announce?

817
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,004
Next month, I think.

818
00:43:50,496 --> 00:43:52,739
You know, get out there
early, start raising money.

819
00:43:53,581 --> 00:43:55,841
In fact, I thought I'd make
the rounds of some people

820
00:43:55,865 --> 00:43:56,850
before then, you know?

821
00:43:56,862 --> 00:43:57,613
Feel them out.

822
00:43:57,777 --> 00:43:58,563
What, Watkins?

823
00:43:58,797 --> 00:43:59,924
Hey, he seems to like me.

824
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,484
You really think Odell Watkins

825
00:44:01,495 --> 00:44:03,173
is gonna split from
the mayor's camp?

826
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:05,783
What you could do is, ah...

827
00:44:06,229 --> 00:44:07,812
feel him out on an issue or two.

828
00:44:08,082 --> 00:44:09,830
You go in that way,
it's more subtle.

829
00:44:09,842 --> 00:44:11,484
You gotta charm the guy first.

830
00:44:11,648 --> 00:44:13,806
Talk to him about the issues
and then down the road

831
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:16,062
see if he's willing to throw
sunshine on your ass.

832
00:44:16,106 --> 00:44:16,798
I like that.

833
00:44:17,643 --> 00:44:18,417
We should do that.

834
00:44:18,863 --> 00:44:19,320
We?

835
00:44:20,704 --> 00:44:21,854
I was thinking...

836
00:44:22,253 --> 00:44:24,611
maybe you would ticket
your white ass up with me.

837
00:44:25,068 --> 00:44:26,542
Make a run for Council President.

838
00:44:26,605 --> 00:44:28,987
Me at the top of the ticket,
an emerging black leader

839
00:44:29,091 --> 00:44:31,942
handsome, well-spoken...
you the great white hope

840
00:44:32,493 --> 00:44:34,100
the new voice of civic reform.

841
00:44:35,508 --> 00:44:36,704
We'd give Royce a run, man.

842
00:44:36,997 --> 00:44:39,578
And what makes you think I'm
interested in Council President?

843
00:44:39,965 --> 00:44:41,396
What the hell else you got going?

844
00:44:44,293 --> 00:44:44,938
Think about it.

845
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,882
look at 'em. Like roaches
when you turn the lights on.

846
00:45:03,894 --> 00:45:04,832
What's it look like?

847
00:45:05,653 --> 00:45:06,545
Head and torso.

848
00:45:07,108 --> 00:45:08,423
You got two casings over here.

849
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,381
Hold the call.

850
00:45:10,897 --> 00:45:13,524
So much for the no-violence-
- in-hampsterdam theory, huh?

851
00:45:15,214 --> 00:45:15,648
Herc...

852
00:45:20,436 --> 00:45:21,422
Help me move the body.

853
00:45:22,817 --> 00:45:23,122
What?

854
00:45:23,392 --> 00:45:25,363
Just up the block,
just out of the free zone.

855
00:45:25,386 --> 00:45:26,958
Carv, you've lost
your fucking mind.

856
00:45:26,982 --> 00:45:29,402
Before the ambo gets here
to pronounce him, we can do it.

857
00:45:29,403 --> 00:45:29,708
Why?

858
00:45:29,732 --> 00:45:31,081
Because if homicide gets here...

859
00:45:31,421 --> 00:45:32,747
if they do any kinda canvass...

860
00:45:32,755 --> 00:45:35,488
they're gonna get wind of this
shit on the sixth floor downtown.

861
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,036
- Good.
- Herc, c'mon.

862
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:38,608
No way, man.

863
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:39,840
No way.

864
00:45:43,675 --> 00:45:44,672
Fuck those stripes.

865
00:45:46,197 --> 00:45:46,642
Fuck 'em.

866
00:45:49,071 --> 00:45:50,091
Hey Toke, Gil...

867
00:45:50,244 --> 00:45:51,944
help me move this guy
outta Hamsterdam.

868
00:45:55,408 --> 00:45:56,945
I'll be first officer at the scene.

869
00:45:57,074 --> 00:45:58,083
It's my responsibility.

870
00:46:03,608 --> 00:46:05,033
Don't forget the casings.

871
00:46:13,799 --> 00:46:14,914
Make sure that you call me.

872
00:46:14,949 --> 00:46:15,394
I will.

873
00:46:15,676 --> 00:46:16,239
Thank you.

874
00:46:16,263 --> 00:46:17,013
Take care. Bye.

875
00:46:44,992 --> 00:46:46,681
7-60 to kga.

876
00:46:47,197 --> 00:46:48,335
<i>Go ahead, 7-60.</i>

877
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:51,596
Have 70010-11 me on
Vincent Street below Fayette.

878
00:46:51,936 --> 00:46:53,508
<i>10-4, Vincent south of Fayette. </i>

879
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:57,635
You say you worked with this guy?

880
00:46:59,336 --> 00:47:01,494
Three shots, no warnings.

881
00:47:01,588 --> 00:47:03,336
He scared of black
people or something?

882
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:04,204
Shit.

883
00:47:07,917 --> 00:47:08,973
The shit's gone too far.

884
00:47:09,113 --> 00:47:10,228
Yeah, you're tellin' me.

885
00:47:18,214 --> 00:47:21,005
Yeah, I need the number
to the newspaper, "The Sun".

886
00:47:24,278 --> 00:47:26,827
Yeah, the number for the reporters.
The newsroom, yeah...

887
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:37,898
So, you ain't gonna
say nothing on it?

888
00:47:38,215 --> 00:47:39,212
What is there to say?

889
00:47:40,467 --> 00:47:41,687
Avon, this is blood.

890
00:47:42,321 --> 00:47:43,505
- Family.
- I know it.

891
00:47:43,681 --> 00:47:46,426
An' I'm tellin' you that someone
may have done this to us, Avon.

892
00:47:46,508 --> 00:47:47,724
To our family.

893
00:47:47,807 --> 00:47:49,179
The cop's just sayin' that shit.

894
00:47:49,355 --> 00:47:50,352
To mess with your head.

895
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:51,068
Exactly.

896
00:47:51,232 --> 00:47:51,701
Why?

897
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,103
That cop don't know me for shit.
What the hell am I to him?

898
00:47:55,126 --> 00:47:57,132
He knows you're gonna
want to think this thing.

899
00:47:57,134 --> 00:47:59,222
That Dee, you know,
he wouldn't do what he did.

900
00:47:59,234 --> 00:48:00,242
I do think it.

901
00:48:07,188 --> 00:48:08,607
Was it some beef he had?

902
00:48:09,041 --> 00:48:10,191
Someone on the inside?

903
00:48:10,238 --> 00:48:12,713
That cop said it was someone
who didn't want you to know

904
00:48:12,842 --> 00:48:14,566
and so they made
it look like it did.

905
00:48:15,164 --> 00:48:16,384
Ain't nobody did nothing.

906
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,214
- But the cop said...
- He's lying.

907
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:21,498
He paid to lie.

908
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:38,268
Avon...

909
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,474
you are my brother.

910
00:48:42,726 --> 00:48:44,732
I need to know this
more than anything...

911
00:48:48,274 --> 00:48:49,612
Dee did not roll on us.

912
00:48:50,421 --> 00:48:54,368
He came to the edge, but he
turned around and walked away.

913
00:48:55,177 --> 00:48:58,755
And I know he was willing to do
what he had to for his family.

914
00:48:59,060 --> 00:48:59,939
For us...

915
00:49:02,805 --> 00:49:04,518
but I need to know
that you know that

916
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,403
and you saw him that way.

917
00:49:07,638 --> 00:49:08,037
What...

918
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:10,758
What you tryin' to say?

919
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:15,770
If something happened...

920
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,588
The fuck are you even thinking?

921
00:49:18,984 --> 00:49:21,840
That I had something to do with it?
I could do that to my own kin?

922
00:49:23,986 --> 00:49:25,441
Is that what you fucking think?

923
00:49:26,074 --> 00:49:27,527
The fuck is in your head?

924
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,280
I ain't do nothing to Dee.

925
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:33,333
I ain't have shit to do with it.

926
00:49:36,336 --> 00:49:37,313
To do with what?

927
00:49:40,797 --> 00:49:41,747
To do with what?!

928
00:49:42,357 --> 00:49:43,178
Whatever happened.

929
00:49:46,909 --> 00:49:48,768
Whatever it is that
happened, Brianna.

930
00:50:09,551 --> 00:50:11,169
You think I don't
know my business?

931
00:50:11,181 --> 00:50:12,237
Is that what you think?

932
00:50:12,249 --> 00:50:14,079
I can get him to you
tomorrow morning.

933
00:50:14,688 --> 00:50:16,225
Just let me see
if I can find him.

934
00:50:19,594 --> 00:50:20,638
I'll make good on this.

935
00:50:23,287 --> 00:50:23,944
What'd he say?

936
00:50:24,263 --> 00:50:26,386
They found a blood trail
going back up the block.

937
00:50:27,853 --> 00:50:28,815
So maybe...

938
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,997
Smeared, with drag marks.

939
00:50:33,366 --> 00:50:35,629
And they also found a third
casing at the other end.

940
00:50:36,004 --> 00:50:36,497
Shit.

941
00:50:39,716 --> 00:50:40,713
So what's the deal?

942
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:43,681
Deal is, we turn this into
a dunker by tomorrow morning

943
00:50:43,751 --> 00:50:46,273
or he starts typing a report
for I.S.D. and the Deputy Ops.

944
00:50:46,332 --> 00:50:47,141
Fuck me.

945
00:50:47,282 --> 00:50:48,197
No, fuck me!

946
00:50:56,293 --> 00:50:58,193
Look, you didn't move
that body, Sergeant.

947
00:50:59,484 --> 00:51:00,375
I moved the body.

948
00:51:01,511 --> 00:51:02,332
Do you understand?

949
00:51:03,775 --> 00:51:05,957
Look, I respect that you did
what you did on behalf

950
00:51:05,968 --> 00:51:07,458
of what I'm trying to do down here

951
00:51:08,572 --> 00:51:09,945
but the responsibility is mine.

952
00:51:13,622 --> 00:51:14,467
So what do we do?

953
00:51:17,669 --> 00:51:20,766
He basically said he wasn't
gonna commit any new resources

954
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:23,037
though he has placed
it on the agenda

955
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,373
of the coordinating council
on criminal justice

956
00:51:25,935 --> 00:51:26,921
for what that's worth...

957
00:51:26,991 --> 00:51:27,894
Poor Clarence.

958
00:51:28,258 --> 00:51:29,278
He's looking tired.

959
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:32,117
So we're looking for help
from the statehouse.

960
00:51:32,634 --> 00:51:34,768
If the city could
get a couple 100,000

961
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:37,595
we could afford an overtime
detail to protect these folks.

962
00:51:37,771 --> 00:51:40,387
I know this is an easier sell
with the mayor involved, but...

963
00:51:40,399 --> 00:51:41,443
could you convince him?

964
00:51:41,466 --> 00:51:42,158
Clarence?

965
00:51:42,629 --> 00:51:44,178
He barely listens anymore...

966
00:51:44,224 --> 00:51:46,043
Jesus, tell me about it.

967
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:47,684
I been a councilman
three years now

968
00:51:47,685 --> 00:51:49,562
that's a long fucking
time to be ignored.

969
00:51:52,822 --> 00:51:54,558
I'm sayin' the rules got broke.

970
00:51:55,485 --> 00:51:57,115
My people kept their promises

971
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:00,400
they did what they said and they
were as good as their word.

972
00:52:01,772 --> 00:52:02,484
Y'all...

973
00:52:04,607 --> 00:52:06,144
y'all ain't keep up
your end of it.

974
00:52:06,202 --> 00:52:07,082
Wasn't my people.

975
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:09,487
Look, I ain't makin' those
distinctions right now.

976
00:52:10,003 --> 00:52:12,854
Fact is, somebody brought a gun
up in the free zone and used it

977
00:52:13,311 --> 00:52:15,399
and both those things
against the promises made.

978
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:18,637
Now, I can't justify this shit if
I've got dead bodies up in there.

979
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:22,121
So what I'm sayin'
is this: come tomorrow

980
00:52:22,894 --> 00:52:24,677
if I don't have a
shooter in bracelets

981
00:52:25,604 --> 00:52:29,616
this whole Hampsterdam
affair is over, it's finished.

982
00:52:29,944 --> 00:52:31,950
I'm gonna take my people
back up on the corners

983
00:52:31,962 --> 00:52:33,721
and we gonna fuck y'all
every way we can.

984
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:34,896
You hear me?

985
00:52:36,033 --> 00:52:37,793
Yeah, it was good
while it lasted, huh?

986
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:39,705
You had cash on the barrel

987
00:52:40,022 --> 00:52:41,676
and you ain't never
need no bail money.

988
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:43,799
And hell, I had clean corners
everywhere I looked.

989
00:52:43,834 --> 00:52:45,344
But all that gonna be gone tomorrow

990
00:52:46,094 --> 00:52:47,701
unless y'all bring me my shooter.

991
00:52:56,153 --> 00:52:57,161
You think that'll work?

992
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,129
Do you?

993
00:53:05,168 --> 00:53:06,130
That's good food.

994
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,611
How'd you know about this place?

995
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,488
It was big when Clinton was in.

996
00:53:13,051 --> 00:53:14,271
This and the Red Sage.

997
00:53:14,764 --> 00:53:16,797
Now it's all steakhouses
and cigar bars.

998
00:53:18,791 --> 00:53:21,641
So you live here, but you spend
a lot of time in Baltimore, right?

999
00:53:22,462 --> 00:53:23,530
I have work up there.

1000
00:53:24,327 --> 00:53:26,897
And the alumni stuff
with St. Mary's on the hill.

1001
00:53:27,186 --> 00:53:29,790
I went to U.M. law, so I still
have connections there too.

1002
00:53:29,989 --> 00:53:31,455
Actually, I grew up in Homeland.

1003
00:53:31,749 --> 00:53:32,206
Yeah?

1004
00:53:34,787 --> 00:53:35,912
Lauraville for me.

1005
00:53:36,851 --> 00:53:38,059
Where'd you go to college?

1006
00:53:38,634 --> 00:53:39,490
Loyola.

1007
00:53:40,557 --> 00:53:41,484
Only one year.

1008
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,170
My girlfriend got pregnant so...

1009
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:47,765
so...

1010
00:53:48,903 --> 00:53:49,654
so...

1011
00:53:51,835 --> 00:53:54,064
so you became
a cop in Baltimore.

1012
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:55,882
How's that working for you?

1013
00:53:55,918 --> 00:53:56,832
Oh, it's pretty good.

1014
00:53:56,997 --> 00:53:59,378
I do a lot of high-end drug stuff.

1015
00:53:59,882 --> 00:54:00,680
Wiretaps.

1016
00:54:01,618 --> 00:54:04,375
Prolonged investigations of violent
offenders, that kinda stuff...

1017
00:54:06,193 --> 00:54:08,536
In fact is, there's not a lot
of guys in the department

1018
00:54:08,571 --> 00:54:10,764
that can do that kinda thing.
It takes a certain...

1019
00:54:12,301 --> 00:54:14,119
I dunno, you gotta love it.

1020
00:54:18,987 --> 00:54:20,476
Thrill of the chase an' all that.

1021
00:54:27,506 --> 00:54:28,960
So, you do what in politics?

1022
00:54:29,652 --> 00:54:31,201
I do political campaigns.

1023
00:54:32,761 --> 00:54:34,251
Like a campaign manager?

1024
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,371
More of a strategist really.

1025
00:54:38,169 --> 00:54:39,611
Not so much the day-to-day stuff

1026
00:54:39,658 --> 00:54:41,675
but the strategy of how
a candidate can win.

1027
00:54:43,259 --> 00:54:45,300
A consultant of sorts.

1028
00:54:45,347 --> 00:54:47,294
You strategizing for
anyone in Baltimore?

1029
00:54:48,197 --> 00:54:49,186
I shouldn't say.

1030
00:54:50,464 --> 00:54:52,763
I mean, he hasn't officially
announced anything yet.

1031
00:54:53,303 --> 00:54:53,866
He any good?

1032
00:54:56,728 --> 00:54:58,851
Hey, if you're for him,
I'll throw the guy a vote.

1033
00:54:58,875 --> 00:54:59,485
What the hell.

1034
00:54:59,508 --> 00:55:00,798
Who'd you vote for this time?

1035
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,012
What? You mean Bush
and whatshisname?

1036
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:05,502
Kerry.

1037
00:55:06,992 --> 00:55:08,270
You didn't vote for president?

1038
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,983
I thought about it
yeah, and you know

1039
00:55:11,424 --> 00:55:13,372
Bush seemed way
over his head, I know

1040
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,952
but he wasn't gonna win
in Maryland anyhow.

1041
00:55:17,172 --> 00:55:18,474
And besides, these guys...

1042
00:55:19,272 --> 00:55:20,633
it doesn't matter who you got.

1043
00:55:21,606 --> 00:55:23,609
None of 'em has a clue
what's really going on.

1044
00:55:23,633 --> 00:55:25,275
I mean, where I'm
working every day?

1045
00:55:26,131 --> 00:55:28,700
The only way any of these guys
would even find west Baltimore

1046
00:55:28,712 --> 00:55:31,621
is if, I dunno, Air Force One
crash lands into Monroe Street

1047
00:55:31,633 --> 00:55:32,888
on it's way back to Andrews.

1048
00:55:34,635 --> 00:55:35,809
It just never connects.

1049
00:55:38,342 --> 00:55:39,539
Not to what I see, anyway.

1050
00:55:45,468 --> 00:55:46,923
