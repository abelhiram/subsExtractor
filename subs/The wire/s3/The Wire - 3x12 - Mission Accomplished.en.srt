1
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:25,172
- Who's got the scene ?
- Massey and Crutchfield are working it.

2
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,066
Norris is on his way to the morgue.
He'll beat the bodies there.

3
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:31,942
He's getting the full treatment, boss.

4
00:01:33,233 --> 00:01:35,046
We're good there.

5
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:37,983
Just one witness so far.

6
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:42,538
You know what that means.
Right now it's all BNBG.

7
00:01:42,756 --> 00:01:44,726
It's Andy Kraw's
big adventure.

8
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:48,587
Mayor's office already called twice,
worried sick about the man.

9
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:50,085
You're kidding me.

10
00:01:50,326 --> 00:01:52,267
That's a whole lotta
campaign contributions

11
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:54,267
sitting on the back of that ambo.

12
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,017
So what's the scene say ?

13
00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:59,266
Two shooters. Shotgun, semiauto.

14
00:01:59,303 --> 00:02:02,656
One vic is a West Side soldier
with a pretty healthy sheet

15
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:07,061
the other is a major player
in Daniel's wiretap case.

16
00:02:07,146 --> 00:02:09,152
So a hit.
Drug related.

17
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,011
With a big time developer
in the middle ?

18
00:02:11,026 --> 00:02:12,444
What's the fit ?

19
00:02:12,454 --> 00:02:14,659
Second vic, Russell Bell

20
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,007
owner and co-developer
of this here.

21
00:02:18,454 --> 00:02:20,625
And other downtown
real estate.

22
00:02:21,428 --> 00:02:24,188
Well propertied man,
he was.

23
00:02:26,107 --> 00:02:27,846
But you were aware that Russell Bell

24
00:02:27,906 --> 00:02:30,398
was regarded as a major
narcotic violator.

25
00:02:31,643 --> 00:02:34,284
Well, how do you think
he made his money ?

26
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,460
I didn't inquire.

27
00:02:36,508 --> 00:02:39,038
You never got a look
at either of the gunmen.

28
00:02:39,062 --> 00:02:42,961
I told you. I saw only the one of them.
He was black

29
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:47,235
big, I thought,
with a large weapon.

30
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,131
BNBG.

31
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:58,845
Big negro, big gun.

32
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:22,102
Two more
like it upstairs.

33
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:23,157
Yeah.

34
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:31,340
Have ballistics rush comparisons.
Drug-relateds for the last six months.

35
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:44,234
I caught him, Bunk.

36
00:04:46,215 --> 00:04:47,727
On the wire. I caught him.

37
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,421
He doesn't
fuckin'know it.

38
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:31,020
Mission Accomplished

39
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,525
Boxing, yeah.

40
00:06:39,177 --> 00:06:40,387
I know
you loved that.

41
00:06:40,577 --> 00:06:44,059
Ugh, I hated it.
I hated watching it.

42
00:06:44,152 --> 00:06:45,520
Yeah,
I know you did.

43
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,727
So you're
doing good, huh ?

44
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:51,177
Day to day, I am.

45
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:53,036
'Cause I was thinking
maybe...

46
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:02,770
I'm proud of you, Dennis.
Be well.

47
00:07:16,271 --> 00:07:17,910
Shut that
fuckin'door.

48
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:32,393
Man, fuck it.

49
00:07:33,016 --> 00:07:34,106
I'm ready for this shit.

50
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:36,643
These niggers are snappin'on us.
You see ?

51
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:38,918
Do you believe this fucking shit ?

52
00:07:39,022 --> 00:07:42,019
Some shit like this woulda never
happened with the old Barksdale.

53
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,525
Yo, Slim, man.
Say the motherfuckin'word.

54
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:53,386
Shit is on.

55
00:08:01,405 --> 00:08:02,269
'Sup, B ?

56
00:08:10,302 --> 00:08:11,137
You a'ight ?

57
00:08:11,964 --> 00:08:14,953
We gonna bounce back
on the motherfucker, no question.

58
00:08:15,033 --> 00:08:16,227
Bounce back on who ?

59
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,298
Marlo, boss.
Oh, he gonna fall.

60
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:21,555
Marlo, Marlo ain't got
shit to do with it.

61
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,528
Marlo couldn't
get String like that.

62
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,930
String died'cause of some other shit.

63
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:28,336
What ?

64
00:08:28,406 --> 00:08:30,571
He died because
of some other shit, nigger.

65
00:08:32,939 --> 00:08:34,937
I couldn't fix it.
I tried.

66
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,111
That nigger String was
right about this shit, man.

67
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,045
That nigger was right.

68
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:44,162
Fuck Marlo. Fuck this fucking war.

69
00:08:44,163 --> 00:08:47,200
All this beef over
a couple of fuckin'corners.

70
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:51,811
Don't matter who did
what to who at this point.

71
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,460
Fact is, we went to war

72
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:55,684
and now there ain't no going back.

73
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,318
I mean, shit

74
00:08:57,398 --> 00:08:58,957
it's what war is, you know.

75
00:08:59,363 --> 00:09:02,242
Once you in it, you in it.

76
00:09:04,448 --> 00:09:07,121
If it's a lie
then we fight on that lie

77
00:09:07,976 --> 00:09:09,448
but we gotta fight.

78
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:18,241
Got this out of his pocket.

79
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:22,899
I got no idea.

80
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:25,876
It's a cell chip from a phone.

81
00:09:28,128 --> 00:09:29,526
What elsedid you get off him ?

82
00:09:29,684 --> 00:09:32,796
200 cash, set of keys, license.

83
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,225
President Street address ?

84
00:09:35,605 --> 00:09:37,981
I got Landsman bangin'out
a warrant for the place.

85
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,262
Fuck the politics for a minute.

86
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,891
What if the man happens to be right ?

87
00:09:44,907 --> 00:09:46,387
Legalizing drugs ?

88
00:09:46,414 --> 00:09:48,355
Crime is down in his district and

89
00:09:48,369 --> 00:09:50,480
people on that side of town,
they're okay with it.

90
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:52,968
Look, if you don't exist,
what happens here ?

91
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:54,237
If there's no Tommy Carcetti

92
00:09:54,238 --> 00:09:55,914
in this thing,
what's likely to happen ?

93
00:09:55,974 --> 00:09:58,193
The mayor and Burrell,
they shut this thing down.

94
00:09:58,194 --> 00:09:59,888
I figure the Mayor's
trying to find a way

95
00:09:59,896 --> 00:10:02,388
to shuit down to make it look like
it was an enforcement plan

96
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:03,483
in case it goes public

97
00:10:03,587 --> 00:10:06,527
otherwise he'd have
moved to end it already.

98
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,212
Makes sense.
But no matter what

99
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,270
Colvin's little experiment
is finished.

100
00:10:14,062 --> 00:10:15,145
Come on, Tommy.

101
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:17,266
They dealt you a winning hand

102
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:19,206
and you're acting like you
forgot how to play.

103
00:10:22,903 --> 00:10:26,468
Mr. Mayor, call it legalization
and my office can't live with it.

104
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:28,218
Agreed.
No one can.

105
00:10:28,306 --> 00:10:29,563
But harm reduction.

106
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:32,643
That could sell provided there's a
reduction in the crime rate.

107
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,189
Harm reduction.
Sounds good.

108
00:10:35,356 --> 00:10:38,197
Steven, what if we were
able to suggest

109
00:10:38,229 --> 00:10:41,237
limiting our
street level enforcement

110
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:45,236
we were concentrating our resources
on high-level traffickers.

111
00:10:45,332 --> 00:10:46,334
How would that play ?

112
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,008
Well, if I could show off that kind
of casework, yeah, maybe.

113
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,308
But they've been doing
street rips for so long now

114
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:52,830
I don't think
a high level exists.

115
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:55,148
What if we were able to say
that no major traffickers

116
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:57,726
were allowed in the free zone...

117
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,556
That the major violators
were still being targeted, huh ?

118
00:11:02,937 --> 00:11:05,070
Are you suggesting
some kind of admissions

119
00:11:05,086 --> 00:11:07,065
criteria for the zones ?
How would that work ?

120
00:11:07,093 --> 00:11:08,220
I don't know that it would.

121
00:11:08,248 --> 00:11:10,567
I'm just saying that for
the sake of public perception.

122
00:11:10,584 --> 00:11:12,876
Come on, people,
work with me on this thing.

123
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,647
<i>Fucked up, ain't it ?</i>

124
00:11:14,722 --> 00:11:17,444
<i>Marlo need to get his ass
dropped, him and all his crew. </i>

125
00:11:17,492 --> 00:11:19,179
<i>They gonna fall.
You'll see. </i>

126
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,359
<i>All right, let me know. </i>

127
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,730
That's the word
on the wire, anyway.

128
00:11:23,985 --> 00:11:26,961
Every mention puts it
on Marlo Stanfield's crew

129
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:30,086
which means the war's
gonna ratchet up, no question.

130
00:11:30,325 --> 00:11:31,662
Where's Jimmy ?

131
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:34,638
He went with Bunk Moreland
to rifle Stringer's spot downtown.

132
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:39,046
- How'd he take it ?
- Like Stringer was kin.

133
00:11:40,987 --> 00:11:42,348
- Yeah ?
- <i>Bushy Top</i>

134
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:45,818
- <i>need to pull your coat up. </i>
- Hey, what's up, Major ?

135
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:49,354
<i>I got somethin'for y'all.
Mount Vernon Square in about an hour. </i>

136
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:51,424
I'm there.

137
00:12:16,491 --> 00:12:17,583
This is Stringer's ?

138
00:12:20,465 --> 00:12:21,085
Yeah.

139
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:50,828
Who in fuck was I chasing ?

140
00:13:18,045 --> 00:13:20,969
What's done is done.

141
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,834
Gay ass gangsters.
Please.

142
00:13:47,022 --> 00:13:49,843
I took it for as long as I could.

143
00:13:53,844 --> 00:13:55,095
Let's go, man.

144
00:13:56,894 --> 00:13:57,586
Let's go.

145
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:20,353
It being your town, I trust you
to do it proper.

146
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:33,662
You off today, boss ?

147
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:36,191
Every day, at this point.

148
00:14:36,206 --> 00:14:39,206
I told 'em over at COMSTAT
about my little experiment.

149
00:14:39,726 --> 00:14:41,699
Bosses went crazy, huh ?

150
00:14:42,336 --> 00:14:44,898
Anyway, that's why I called you.

151
00:14:45,487 --> 00:14:48,208
That there is a wartime lay-up
for your man Barksdale.

152
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,067
My sources tell me the man's there

153
00:14:50,104 --> 00:14:51,775
most of the time
with a lot of muscle :

154
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,238
sawed-offs, semiautos, Mac-11s.

155
00:14:54,913 --> 00:14:56,913
Whole lot of good shit
if you hit it right.

156
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,014
- That's a hell of a tip.
- Shit.

157
00:15:01,823 --> 00:15:04,157
That right there might be
the last bit of police work

158
00:15:04,176 --> 00:15:05,554
in a long and storied career.

159
00:15:06,394 --> 00:15:08,160
I'll talk to you, Bushy Top.

160
00:15:15,513 --> 00:15:16,913
Which one is Ali ?

161
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:19,667
In the white trunks, boy.

162
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,133
- Damn, he look young.
- He was.

163
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:24,736
This the Patterson fight
right here. Old school.

164
00:15:25,221 --> 00:15:27,130
Who Patterson ?
He soft.

165
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:29,088
Ali whippin'his ass.

166
00:15:29,243 --> 00:15:31,004
He was a champ too.

167
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,899
Look, any man still standing
at the end of a round

168
00:15:34,054 --> 00:15:37,093
you can't call him soft.
That's a rule, all right ?

169
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:44,844
From Stringer's place downtown.

170
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:48,489
B and B shit, college papers,
real estate stuff.

171
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,719
There's no phone extension
in the place, just these.

172
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:54,091
Cell phone chips. 'Bout 100 of them.

173
00:15:54,157 --> 00:15:56,396
So that's why he wasn't
taking any phones

174
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,769
from our man Bernard, huh ?

175
00:15:57,813 --> 00:15:58,947
Stringer had his own phone

176
00:15:58,962 --> 00:16:01,392
he just changed the number every
time he changed the chip.

177
00:16:01,411 --> 00:16:04,161
Shamrock too, probably, with
whatever phone he used to call Bell.

178
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:05,036
Cautious man.

179
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,557
Yes and no.

180
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:11,313
Have a look in here.
All different manufacturers.

181
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:20,149
Before Stringer Bell got aced

182
00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:23,946
he went out of his way to put in
his good friend Avon Barksdale.

183
00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:27,214
That's a Barksdale safe house.

184
00:16:28,972 --> 00:16:30,201
Where'd you get this ?

185
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:35,398
Colvin.

186
00:16:37,002 --> 00:16:39,740
- Calls to the Western.
- Where's Daniels ?

187
00:16:40,427 --> 00:16:43,228
He's got this thing downtown.
It's for his wife.

188
00:16:43,661 --> 00:16:44,718
You should raise him.

189
00:16:47,252 --> 00:16:49,161
It's not enough
to make up for Stringer.

190
00:16:50,587 --> 00:16:51,937
It'll do for now.

191
00:16:54,204 --> 00:16:55,458
Because the neighborhoods

192
00:16:55,518 --> 00:16:57,592
and the residents
in this district are among

193
00:16:57,698 --> 00:17:00,614
the poorest in our city.
And it is these residents

194
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:03,689
who most need
a strong voice at City Hall.

195
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:06,135
Time has come for a change.

196
00:17:06,136 --> 00:17:08,906
<i>And I believe I can
bring about that change</i>

197
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:13,178
<i>by providing a strong voice
for the new 11th District</i>

198
00:17:14,582 --> 00:17:15,840
<i>if you will do me the honor... </i>

199
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,893
It's kind of cool, the lieutenant's wife
running for office, you know.

200
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:23,185
<i>Well, as you just heard,
West Baltimore City</i>

201
00:17:23,186 --> 00:17:26,208
<i>Council woman Eunetta Perkins
is going to have her hands full</i>

202
00:17:26,224 --> 00:17:28,198
<i>in next September's
Democratic finals. </i>

203
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,619
Stringer Bell.
Damn.

204
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:34,395
Who could have got to him ?

205
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:36,664
I mean, if it wasn't y'all on it.

206
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:38,986
You know Avon's gonna
put it on you, right ?

207
00:17:39,273 --> 00:17:41,103
Shit, let him take it
on my jacket.

208
00:17:41,286 --> 00:17:42,607
Don't make me no never mind.

209
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:45,695
I'm thinkin'it might be what
you call one of them good problems.

210
00:17:47,135 --> 00:17:48,042
Yeah.

211
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,215
I heard Colvin's
in deep shit downtown.

212
00:17:57,106 --> 00:17:58,650
Looking at this right here

213
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,215
he might not be the only one.

214
00:18:04,132 --> 00:18:05,613
Anything comes up,
I'm on the radio.

215
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:11,199
My man, my man, my man.
Yo, you think I could get like $5 ?

216
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,079
- I need like $5 to get on the bus.
- I look like a tourist to you ?

217
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:16,483
- Man, I swear to God.
- Lookin'like that

218
00:18:16,538 --> 00:18:18,097
walking into
an open-air drug market

219
00:18:18,134 --> 00:18:20,134
why the hell would
I think you'll spend my $5

220
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:21,343
on bus fare ?

221
00:18:22,658 --> 00:18:25,188
Shit,'cause I already
got my blast, man.

222
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:23,513
All night you been drinking
like your ass is candy.

223
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:25,949
That's shameful shit.

224
00:19:32,643 --> 00:19:33,973
12-gauge pumpkin balls.

225
00:19:37,227 --> 00:19:40,297
Last time I saw that kind of load
was the Pimlico double

226
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:44,805
and I fuckin'know that motherfucker
was in the middle of that mess.

227
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:47,867
And if I remember your boy

228
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:50,719
he had no love
for the Barksdale people.

229
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:53,349
Execution style, that don't play
like Omar Little.

230
00:19:54,988 --> 00:19:58,394
Besides, the word on our wire
is that Marlo's people did Stringer.

231
00:19:58,988 --> 00:20:01,599
- Marlo Stanfield ?
- The heir apparent.

232
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,638
This city's going to hell, man.

233
00:20:06,249 --> 00:20:08,912
We're gonna push past 300 murders
before New Year's.

234
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:11,884
Shit is fucked.

235
00:20:15,623 --> 00:20:18,275
Oh, hey, Cheryl.

236
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:22,500
No ? My guess is she's, uh,
picking up a prisoner.

237
00:20:22,866 --> 00:20:25,038
Yeah, I spoke to her
about ten minutes ago.

238
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:27,966
Yeah, well, they make you
check your stuff.

239
00:20:28,652 --> 00:20:31,675
Cell phone, money, weapon.

240
00:20:32,145 --> 00:20:34,659
Well, she'll call
when she gets the message.

241
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:37,183
Not at all.

242
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:40,198
I need more, Jimmy.

243
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:56,694
More !

244
00:20:58,397 --> 00:20:59,893
Motherfucker.

245
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,166
I'm tired, Bunk.

246
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,088
Let's go.

247
00:21:16,032 --> 00:21:17,473
I heard the vanguard met.

248
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:20,769
Heard they voted to have a
civilian review board look at it.

249
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:24,725
It wasn't unanimous. And there were
people there speaking for you.

250
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:26,253
I heard that too.

251
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:31,911
So six out of ten black officers
think I'm just an asshole racist.

252
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,179
On the other hand

253
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,537
four out of ten
think you're just an asshole.

254
00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:45,001
It's an administrative charge.
You can fight it and win

255
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:46,163
if you want.

256
00:21:46,362 --> 00:21:49,672
Failure to properly identify myself
as a police officer.

257
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:54,307
Sounds like what I was guilty of
most of my career, actually.

258
00:21:57,637 --> 00:21:59,579
I'm not sure
I was supposed to be a police.

259
00:22:01,966 --> 00:22:03,144
Not really.

260
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,779
What were ya supposed to be, huh ?

261
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:16,255
This is from Major Colvin's CI ?

262
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,348
What's the corroboration ?

263
00:22:18,762 --> 00:22:22,120
Well, the source knew that Barksdale
had a waterfront condo in his own name

264
00:22:22,231 --> 00:22:24,443
gave the accurate location,
and title info

265
00:22:24,467 --> 00:22:25,931
down to deed of transfer.

266
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,462
Well, that's good, but it puts him on
the legitimate side of things.

267
00:22:29,751 --> 00:22:32,074
What corroboration is there
for illegal activities ?

268
00:22:33,236 --> 00:22:34,796
Sorry I'm late.

269
00:22:34,955 --> 00:22:36,212
I had to stop in at a friend.

270
00:22:36,308 --> 00:22:38,424
The source knew that Barksdale
was shot last month

271
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:39,491
wounded in the shoulder.

272
00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:42,204
- Emergency room ?
- No, no hospital reports.

273
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,564
We're gonna need better.

274
00:22:44,628 --> 00:22:47,779
Either Colvin goes back to the CI
or we sit on this address for a while.

275
00:22:47,891 --> 00:22:50,246
- we can see.
- Well, fuck it, then.

276
00:22:50,922 --> 00:22:53,226
Let's name the source.
Put him right in the affidavit.

277
00:22:53,254 --> 00:22:55,658
- It's Colvin's call, isn't it ?
- It's Stringer Bell.

278
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,865
Lester figured it out from the DNRs.

279
00:23:00,575 --> 00:23:02,707
Bell was snitching out Barksdale.

280
00:23:03,193 --> 00:23:05,628
- You're sure of this ?
- Maybe that explains the murder.

281
00:23:05,707 --> 00:23:06,837
What's in the wire ?

282
00:23:07,434 --> 00:23:09,296
Loose talk about how
it was Marlo's people

283
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,190
but nothing past rumor.

284
00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:13,943
With Bell gone, Barksdale might
have to come down a notch

285
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:16,895
to oversee the day to day, and
maybe that puts him in contact

286
00:23:16,911 --> 00:23:19,251
with some of our
monitored cell phones.

287
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:22,227
If he's as cautious
as Stringer, maybe not.

288
00:23:22,975 --> 00:23:25,330
My guess is Barksdale
never touches a cell phone.

289
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,622
Safe house might be our best shot.

290
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,137
All right.

291
00:23:31,163 --> 00:23:33,167
We stay on the wires until
this batch of burners

292
00:23:33,168 --> 00:23:35,373
goes dead, hoping
we have Barksdale

293
00:23:35,508 --> 00:23:37,036
but meanwhile, we get a warrant

294
00:23:37,052 --> 00:23:38,877
for that safe house
and wait on him there.

295
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,777
Thanks for the cover last night.

296
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:59,471
This is Greggs, Major Case Unit.
Who's the shift leader ?

297
00:24:31,186 --> 00:24:33,896
Holy Christ.

298
00:24:48,283 --> 00:24:50,312
- <i>They're all over it, Commissioner. </i>
- Right

299
00:24:52,382 --> 00:24:54,112
That was Foxtrot.

300
00:24:54,222 --> 00:24:56,768
The cameras have found our
little shit pile.

301
00:24:56,888 --> 00:24:59,653
Your fuckin'councilman
took his sweet time, didn't he ?

302
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,860
Everyone's a critic.

303
00:25:04,248 --> 00:25:06,945
If this doesn't go, what line
of work are you gonna try next ?

304
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,938
We're here in West Baltimore...

305
00:25:16,105 --> 00:25:18,784
For more than a month, police
from Baltimore's Western District.

306
00:25:18,803 --> 00:25:20,601
It's just an outrageous development.

307
00:25:27,452 --> 00:25:30,635
It's something I never thought I'd see
from this or any other administration.

308
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:33,271
Frankly, this is one of the
reasons we need a change

309
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,426
in leadership in this city.

310
00:25:34,454 --> 00:25:36,877
Did the Mayor know ?
What about the Police Commissioner ?

311
00:25:36,905 --> 00:25:39,356
These are questions for the
Mayor and Police Commissioner.

312
00:25:39,384 --> 00:25:41,337
These are central issues
of crime and safety.

313
00:25:41,356 --> 00:25:43,252
The Royce administration
is simply bankrupt.

314
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,365
You still gonna announce
for mayor next month ?

315
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:47,147
Standing here today
looking at this ?

316
00:25:47,282 --> 00:25:49,822
I can't see I can do anything
but put it out there right now.

317
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,231
All I can tell you is that
for more than four weeks now

318
00:25:52,271 --> 00:25:54,109
the Baltimore Police
Department surrendered

319
00:25:54,128 --> 00:25:56,184
portions of the police district
to the drug trade

320
00:25:56,203 --> 00:25:57,842
and the Council was not informed.

321
00:25:57,969 --> 00:26:02,091
Fuck me. I fuckin' had this story
all to myself a week ago.

322
00:26:02,974 --> 00:26:05,314
<i>Police officers for weeks
have turned a blind eye... </i>

323
00:26:05,378 --> 00:26:07,367
What the fuck was I thinking ?

324
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:11,035
<i>.. sanctioning open-air
drug markets. </i>

325
00:26:11,846 --> 00:26:12,590
'Scuse us.

326
00:26:12,591 --> 00:26:18,101
<i>... in the so called free zones,
drug dealers routinely ply... </i>

327
00:26:18,133 --> 00:26:20,122
Mr. Mayor,
Commissioner Burrell is here.

328
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,812
Tell the Commissioner the Mayor
will be with him shortly.

329
00:26:22,907 --> 00:26:25,263
<i>And young children run
the streets alone. </i>

330
00:26:26,114 --> 00:26:28,151
<i>The inhabitants of what
has come to be known</i>

331
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:31,676
<i>as Hampsterdam have little
to say for the camera. </i>

332
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,793
<i>But channel 5 has learned
that the police were... </i>

333
00:26:36,188 --> 00:26:36,809
Yeah ?

334
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:38,050
<i>What are you seein'?</i>

335
00:26:38,194 --> 00:26:40,995
Coupla people in and out.
No sign of Barksdale, though.

336
00:26:41,247 --> 00:26:42,355
<i>It's quiet here too. </i>

337
00:26:42,618 --> 00:26:43,668
Okay.

338
00:26:44,576 --> 00:26:45,801
Need to look at the back.

339
00:26:46,215 --> 00:26:48,761
Our friend Carcetti's gonna
run wild with this.

340
00:26:49,716 --> 00:26:52,756
And from the sound of things,
Gray is gonna run with him.

341
00:26:52,923 --> 00:26:56,010
Tony Gray thinks he's gonna
get my chair behind this bullshit

342
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:58,659
We're throwin'you out
of the boat, Ervin.

343
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:00,030
This shit is on you alone.

344
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:04,477
Not necessarily.

345
00:27:04,628 --> 00:27:07,000
Not if I talk about how
we were under pressure

346
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:08,371
to keep the crime down

347
00:27:08,372 --> 00:27:10,554
to juke the stats
district by district...

348
00:27:10,753 --> 00:27:11,827
You never said that.

349
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:15,010
About how Colvin under pressure,
lost his way

350
00:27:15,077 --> 00:27:16,764
about how I came to you
weeks ago...

351
00:27:16,966 --> 00:27:18,558
- Days ago.
- Weeks ago

352
00:27:18,575 --> 00:27:20,963
to tell you what he had
done and to assure you that

353
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:22,858
we were on top of the situation

354
00:27:22,873 --> 00:27:26,078
that Colvin would be relieved
and his plan aborted.

355
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,892
You lyin'motherfucker.

356
00:27:27,987 --> 00:27:31,218
But you heard about the drop
in Colvin's felony rate

357
00:27:31,361 --> 00:27:33,080
and you sent me packing.

358
00:27:33,414 --> 00:27:36,993
Brought in your liberal-ass
do-gooders to seriously consider

359
00:27:36,994 --> 00:27:38,632
this horseshit

360
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:41,227
while Colvin's
mistake grew and grew.

361
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:44,727
My hands were tied, Mr. Mayor

362
00:27:44,975 --> 00:27:47,410
my department thwarted.

363
00:27:48,213 --> 00:27:51,221
I was a prisoner
of the goddamn politicians.

364
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:53,007
Or...

365
00:27:57,428 --> 00:28:01,502
I leave your office right now
willing to say a lot less than that.

366
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,822
I put what I can
on crazy-ass Bunny Colvin

367
00:28:05,175 --> 00:28:10,526
and I take the hit.
And if Carcetti or Gray holds hearings

368
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:14,724
I'm the wall between them and you.

369
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,901
In which case, I am your commissioner

370
00:28:19,051 --> 00:28:21,955
for the full five-year term.

371
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:34,005
Unit one to unit two.

372
00:28:34,315 --> 00:28:38,070
- Unit two standing by.
- Deal's made.

373
00:28:40,096 --> 00:28:43,528
Unit two to sector three,
move on the Winchester Homes.

374
00:28:43,652 --> 00:28:45,303
<i>Ten-four. We're moving. </i>

375
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,109
Unit two to sector two.

376
00:28:47,332 --> 00:28:48,740
Move on the Koppers plant.

377
00:28:48,844 --> 00:28:49,918
<i>Roger that. </i>

378
00:28:53,225 --> 00:28:55,190
Over the top, gentlemen.

379
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:17,616
'Bout fucking time.

380
00:29:28,951 --> 00:29:31,640
Man, g outaigo re-up.

381
00:29:32,086 --> 00:29:34,712
- Where Tuckie at ?
- I don't know.

382
00:29:39,017 --> 00:29:41,148
- Yo, where Tuckie at, man ?
- He rolled out.

383
00:29:41,228 --> 00:29:43,122
- He said the police comin'.

384
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,406
- D'oh.
- Here they come. Let's roll.

385
00:30:17,053 --> 00:30:18,931
Hold it right there

386
00:30:25,996 --> 00:30:28,240
White jacket !
Stop right there ! Stop !

387
00:30:35,123 --> 00:30:37,256
Freeze ! Police, don't move !

388
00:30:39,979 --> 00:30:42,336
<i>Outstanding, red team.
Oustanding. </i>

389
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:44,449
<i>Give you a case
of beer for that one. </i>

390
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:06,985
Son, this nigga Stringer Bell, man

391
00:31:07,502 --> 00:31:09,364
was beggin'Chris, yo, for real.

392
00:31:09,693 --> 00:31:10,768
Like know what I mean ?

393
00:31:10,797 --> 00:31:13,394
Diggin'in his pockets,
talkin' 'bout how much cheese

394
00:31:13,494 --> 00:31:16,311
he gonna give us, I mean,
if we just let him walk.

395
00:31:16,366 --> 00:31:19,188
My man Chris holler,
"Man, bitch, you gonna die. "

396
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:21,594
This nigga just dropped
to his fuckin' knees like

397
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,355
a little cocksucker,
man, start cryin'.

398
00:31:24,435 --> 00:31:26,568
That shit was worse
than fuckin' pathetic.

399
00:31:29,073 --> 00:31:33,020
- Yo, that's Marlo.
- Get on yo'burner, man.

400
00:31:40,485 --> 00:31:43,191
<i>- Got a line on him.
- The number one ? Where at ?</i>

401
00:31:43,254 --> 00:31:45,554
<i>Tall man says
to tell y'all to soldier up. </i>

402
00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:48,685
<i>They up at the rim shop. </i>

403
00:31:50,905 --> 00:31:53,738
- Boss, you okay ?
- What you want ?

404
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:56,229
Slim said they got
their eye on Marlo.

405
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:00,760
I'm just sayin', you know,
all the boys, they all waitin'on you.

406
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:03,470
Go ahead, man.

407
00:32:04,066 --> 00:32:05,108
I'm behind you.

408
00:32:28,425 --> 00:32:30,380
What else you need
from us, Deputy ?

409
00:32:30,395 --> 00:32:32,259
City Hall wants
the bulldozers through here

410
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:34,529
at dawnand then fencing
all around the site.

411
00:32:34,635 --> 00:32:36,927
Winchester Homes
and the Koppers plant as well.

412
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,781
We got it.

413
00:32:40,643 --> 00:32:42,553
Come tomorrow,
the television reporters

414
00:32:42,648 --> 00:32:44,988
get nothing they can
stand in front of.

415
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,314
'Scuse me, Deputy,
sir, we found a body.

416
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:00,108
Any trauma ?

417
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:03,067
Can't tell for sure
with all the rat bites.

418
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:06,147
Take him to OCME
in a jail wagon.

419
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:09,019
I don't want the fuckin'
reporters seeing any ambos.

420
00:33:10,842 --> 00:33:11,937
Shit.

421
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:25,554
<i>He just landed. Him plus one. </i>

422
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:27,496
Got it. Sit tight.

423
00:33:27,544 --> 00:33:28,658
That makes how many ?

424
00:33:31,045 --> 00:33:33,496
Including Barksdale, Sydnor
counted ten in

425
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:35,645
and one comin'out,
so that's ten at least.

426
00:33:40,256 --> 00:33:41,865
2301 to KGA.

427
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,018
<i>Go ahead, 2301.</i>

428
00:33:44,807 --> 00:33:48,686
We need QRT to meet us at our 20
for a search and seizure.

429
00:33:48,748 --> 00:33:52,602
Location has multiple suspects
and may contain automatic weapons.

430
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:53,653
<i>Ten-four. </i>

431
00:34:02,261 --> 00:34:03,615
Word travels fast, huh ?

432
00:34:04,947 --> 00:34:05,620
Shit.

433
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:10,592
Burrell called Johns Hopkins
personally this morning.

434
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:16,302
Dragged your name into the gutter.

435
00:34:16,303 --> 00:34:18,536
Johns Hopkins doesn't
need the notoriety.

436
00:34:18,597 --> 00:34:21,631
The chief academic officer of a
major research university

437
00:34:21,755 --> 00:34:23,643
doesn't want to hear
that some new hire

438
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,461
makes up the rules
as he goes along.

439
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:32,522
Yeah, Colvin.

440
00:34:38,727 --> 00:34:40,222
COMSTAT tomorrow.

441
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:46,814
I'm up.

442
00:34:54,205 --> 00:34:55,330
Y'all taking a door ?

443
00:34:56,043 --> 00:34:56,992
Where's tactical ?

444
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,433
I called for QRT.

445
00:35:00,006 --> 00:35:00,983
You ain't heard ?

446
00:35:01,035 --> 00:35:03,722
They're a little busy tonight
tearin'down Colvin's fuck up.

447
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:06,754
With all that goin'on,
you're lucky you even got us.

448
00:35:06,873 --> 00:35:09,928
- Who he hittin' on this ?
- Avon Barksdale and crew.

449
00:35:10,111 --> 00:35:13,629
I fuckin' told you he was out.
Did i fuckin' tell you?

450
00:35:14,138 --> 00:35:16,207
I fuckin' told her.

451
00:35:16,342 --> 00:35:19,787
<i>For more than four weeks,
the Baltimore Police Department... </i>

452
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,061
By tomorrow, the story goes national
and Washington reacts.

453
00:35:26,154 --> 00:35:28,149
Save the best
questions for Tony Gray.

454
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:31,370
He needs to shine
even more than you.

455
00:35:40,642 --> 00:35:42,239
I can't believe
he wants us to knock.

456
00:35:42,277 --> 00:35:44,090
Well, you can' flush
guns, now, can you ?

457
00:35:44,157 --> 00:35:46,172
Well, fuck that.
What if they open up on us ?

458
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:48,224
These guys are
at war with another crew.

459
00:35:48,322 --> 00:35:50,932
We go chargin'in there,
chances are we will get lit up.

460
00:36:05,718 --> 00:36:06,788
Yo, B.

461
00:36:07,611 --> 00:36:10,222
Sham sayin'that Charles
sayin'they still up at the rim shop.

462
00:36:10,365 --> 00:36:13,357
Marlo, his boy Chris,
and Vinson, they still eatin'

463
00:36:13,436 --> 00:36:15,999
but the rest of the muscle,
they rolled out.

464
00:36:25,214 --> 00:36:25,872
<i>Police !</i>

465
00:36:27,636 --> 00:36:28,200
No.

466
00:36:29,352 --> 00:36:30,427
Not the police.

467
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:33,330
- Narco's out back too.
- Shit.

468
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:37,242
<i>Let us in !
We know you're in there. </i>

469
00:36:40,113 --> 00:36:42,322
<i>Open the door,
you fucking cocksuckers !</i>

470
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,347
Fucked up, man.

471
00:36:43,423 --> 00:36:45,160
Y'all ask me

472
00:36:45,892 --> 00:36:47,835
y'all ugly ass niggers
shouldn't be in here

473
00:36:47,836 --> 00:36:49,639
fucking around
with all these guns and shit

474
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:53,064
Open it.

475
00:36:57,676 --> 00:37:00,795
<i>Come on, Avon. Enough with this shit.
Open the fucking door. </i>

476
00:37:04,045 --> 00:37:07,145
<i>Open the fucking door,
you cocksuckers. </i>

477
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,862
Police !

478
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,262
- Search warrant !
- I'm clean, man.

479
00:37:15,874 --> 00:37:18,325
<i>Open the fucking door. </i>

480
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,430
Get down !

481
00:37:22,431 --> 00:37:24,500
Face that shit tight. Greggs.

482
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,980
I'm opening up.

483
00:37:32,736 --> 00:37:34,439
That'd be mine.

484
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:36,246
In fact,
all that's mine.

485
00:37:36,317 --> 00:37:38,959
You got a law degree ?

486
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:42,580
Take him.

487
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,956
You fall on the parole violation.
No matter whatever else happens

488
00:37:46,988 --> 00:37:48,937
you do every day of
what's left of your seven

489
00:37:48,955 --> 00:37:49,857
without seeing a jury.

490
00:37:49,866 --> 00:37:52,002
Maybe even conspiracy to murder.

491
00:37:52,017 --> 00:37:55,678
We take this federal, see if we can
get you ten to life... no parole.

492
00:37:55,853 --> 00:37:57,962
Whatever.

493
00:37:58,292 --> 00:38:01,284
Shit, you only do two days no how.

494
00:38:01,499 --> 00:38:04,793
- That's the day you go in.
- And the day you come out.

495
00:38:05,087 --> 00:38:07,220
Yeah, well, here's the warrant.

496
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:15,042
You read it slow.

497
00:38:17,374 --> 00:38:19,771
In between them two days,
give you something to think on.

498
00:38:39,295 --> 00:38:39,963
Damn.

499
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:41,877
Missed our shot.

500
00:38:43,575 --> 00:38:44,215
Roll, man.

501
00:38:47,404 --> 00:38:49,413
You bend over for us,
or I swear to God

502
00:38:49,442 --> 00:38:51,145
I will spend what's
left of my career

503
00:38:51,177 --> 00:38:53,692
shitting on every last
supervisor in your district.

504
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:56,404
From shift commanders down
to sector sergeants, not one of them

505
00:38:56,433 --> 00:38:59,906
will have any rank at all if we
hear so much as a bark out of you.

506
00:39:00,073 --> 00:39:02,652
Look, my people saw this as a
tactical deployment only.

507
00:39:02,978 --> 00:39:04,514
The responsibility is mine alone.

508
00:39:04,515 --> 00:39:06,415
Well, you won't fall alone

509
00:39:07,004 --> 00:39:10,506
unless you're willing to fall exactly
as we want you to.

510
00:39:11,007 --> 00:39:13,888
After COMSTAT,
you go to retirement services

511
00:39:13,943 --> 00:39:16,665
and drop papers, going out
at a lieutenant's grade

512
00:39:16,705 --> 00:39:19,967
That's right, you're busted back.
We can't take your EOD away

513
00:39:20,134 --> 00:39:22,314
but you're not going out
on a major's pay.

514
00:39:22,315 --> 00:39:24,272
I can retire before you bust me.

515
00:39:24,686 --> 00:39:26,564
I got vacation time
enough to make my 30.

516
00:39:26,691 --> 00:39:28,863
Fuck your vacation time.

517
00:39:29,596 --> 00:39:32,540
You're out today, at the lower grade.

518
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,744
That's against the goddamn contract.

519
00:39:34,864 --> 00:39:36,956
What part of bend over
didn't you understand ?

520
00:39:40,434 --> 00:39:41,866
Avon locked up ?

521
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:43,601
With most of his muscle, yeah.

522
00:39:43,617 --> 00:39:46,084
Good day to get back out
on them corners, ain't it ?

523
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:49,697
Make some money.

524
00:39:49,713 --> 00:39:51,050
You bet.

525
00:40:01,558 --> 00:40:03,842
It's not just the 17 millions
in federal funding

526
00:40:03,976 --> 00:40:06,481
for Baltimore law enforcement
that you've jeopardized.

527
00:40:06,505 --> 00:40:09,484
Take off another 200 million of federal
money in your operating budget

528
00:40:09,512 --> 00:40:12,035
another 75 in capital expenditures,

529
00:40:12,457 --> 00:40:15,529
plus untold millions in pass-through
federal dollars from Annapolis.

530
00:40:16,483 --> 00:40:18,441
All told, we're talking about

531
00:40:18,911 --> 00:40:21,600
half a billion a year that Baltimore
will be doing without.

532
00:40:21,696 --> 00:40:24,433
Furthermore, the U.S. Attorney here
will use all the resources

533
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:26,724
of the Justice Department
to interdict and destroy

534
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:28,410
any attempt to establish

535
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:32,072
a geographic entity
where drugs are legal.

536
00:40:32,582 --> 00:40:35,192
Washington should know that
what happened in West Baltimore

537
00:40:35,335 --> 00:40:38,391
in no way reflects the policies
of my administration.

538
00:40:38,701 --> 00:40:40,371
That was an aberration,
Mr. Talmadge.

539
00:40:40,372 --> 00:40:42,664
The work of one
misguided police official.

540
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:44,669
We understand your concerns

541
00:40:44,717 --> 00:40:47,979
but for the deputy drug czar

542
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:50,613
to take the time out
to drive 30 miles north

543
00:40:50,629 --> 00:40:53,080
to deliver that message,
hardly necessary.

544
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:56,533
Rest assured.

545
00:41:00,695 --> 00:41:02,080
What up, G ?

546
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,944
Where the older ones at ?

547
00:41:05,314 --> 00:41:07,351
Marlo got his package back out.

548
00:41:18,569 --> 00:41:21,593
Fire Burrell.
This nonsense began in his shop

549
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,521
without him knowing it.
Fire the man and move on.

550
00:41:24,768 --> 00:41:27,171
Odell, I respect your opinion.

551
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,034
But right now

552
00:41:29,972 --> 00:41:32,956
Tony Gray, Carcetti maneuvering

553
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:35,360
now is not the time.

554
00:41:36,688 --> 00:41:40,002
We get past the primary, then I'll drive
a stake in his heart.

555
00:41:40,103 --> 00:41:41,639
But right now
I need him where he is

556
00:41:41,658 --> 00:41:42,983
for no other reason than to

557
00:41:43,118 --> 00:41:45,164
well, to take the hit
for this thing right here.

558
00:41:45,182 --> 00:41:46,953
But I tell you what
I'm gonna do, though.

559
00:41:47,113 --> 00:41:49,739
I'm gonna shine on that new girl
you like in the 11th.

560
00:41:51,124 --> 00:41:53,259
Give her a spot on the ticket.
Cut Eunetta loose.

561
00:41:53,287 --> 00:41:54,348
Eunetta's had her day.

562
00:41:56,368 --> 00:41:59,264
I respect the fact that
you stood by me, Odell.

563
00:41:59,304 --> 00:42:00,611
I respect loyalty.

564
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:05,758
And did so without properly
informing his superior officers

565
00:42:06,432 --> 00:42:09,584
and without regard to the criminal
statutes he was sworn to enforce

566
00:42:10,053 --> 00:42:12,918
thereby disgracing himself
and his command.

567
00:42:15,671 --> 00:42:17,988
Is any of that subject
to any contradiction

568
00:42:17,989 --> 00:42:20,355
or argument whatsoever,
Major Colvin?

569
00:42:20,684 --> 00:42:21,257
No, sir.

570
00:42:21,671 --> 00:42:22,975
No argument at all, Bunny ?

571
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,147
Not much you can say, is there ?

572
00:42:25,148 --> 00:42:26,835
Not to real police.

573
00:42:27,703 --> 00:42:29,910
- Get on with it,motherfu...
- 'Scuse me, major ?

574
00:42:32,062 --> 00:42:34,306
Is the admin lieutenant present ?

575
00:42:36,112 --> 00:42:38,165
Major Colvin is relieved of duty.

576
00:42:38,253 --> 00:42:41,340
You are now the acting commander
of the Western District.

577
00:43:15,789 --> 00:43:17,989
- Hey, Bunk.
- Hey, Freamon.

578
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,630
- Who is that ? Crutchfield ?

579
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:22,254
- Naw, Norris.

580
00:43:22,278 --> 00:43:23,933
Sleeping on a stakeout.

581
00:43:24,015 --> 00:43:26,413
<i>Damn, Bernard, didn't I tell
you about these guys ?

582
00:43:29,241 --> 00:43:31,676
Yeah, that's everyone
we heard on the wire.

583
00:43:31,737 --> 00:43:33,812
McNulty's over there in number
one with Pearlman.

584
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,472
Why don't you say hey ?

585
00:43:39,807 --> 00:43:42,130
You got to be
the stupidest motherfucker

586
00:43:42,178 --> 00:43:44,024
that I've ever gone out with.

587
00:43:44,327 --> 00:43:46,157
I can't wait to go to jail.

588
00:43:47,104 --> 00:43:48,727
What ? What you say ?

589
00:43:48,783 --> 00:43:51,361
What the fuck did you say, Bernard ?

590
00:44:02,549 --> 00:44:03,870
Hey, Donald.

591
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:10,906
- You heard the tapes.
- Look, he came to me

592
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:13,648
and said we could sell drugs
if we move down to Vincent Street

593
00:44:13,657 --> 00:44:15,028
and that's where I moved my crew.

594
00:44:15,047 --> 00:44:17,929
And you know I did because you the one
that popped me with the G-pack

595
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,404
on my way to the spot,
and let me go, remember ?

596
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:23,309
You were selling drugs
in Major Colvin's free zone ?

597
00:44:23,476 --> 00:44:25,974
- You can prove that.
- Ask him. He know.

598
00:44:26,762 --> 00:44:28,927
This must be one of them
contrapment things.

599
00:44:29,006 --> 00:44:30,626
You mean entrapment.

600
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:33,025
Kid's got a point.

601
00:44:40,099 --> 00:44:42,470
19 in bracelets
from Barksdale on down.

602
00:44:42,478 --> 00:44:44,197
Another eight wanted on warrants.

603
00:44:44,205 --> 00:44:48,009
Any way you can tie your case
to this mess with Colvin ?

604
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:51,150
Make it like what he was
doing led to your thing ?

605
00:44:51,151 --> 00:44:52,139
I don't see it.

606
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:56,521
Well, it's good work
nonetheless, Major Daniels.

607
00:44:59,778 --> 00:45:01,911
Call came in from the Mayor's office

608
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:04,943
half hour ago
approving your promotion.

609
00:45:05,022 --> 00:45:07,802
And now with Colvin,
there's a new vacancy.

610
00:45:10,393 --> 00:45:12,813
- What about my wife ?
- What about her ?

611
00:45:12,932 --> 00:45:15,415
The Mayor. Eunetta's seat.

612
00:45:15,431 --> 00:45:17,687
- Why would the Mayor...
- Good police work maybe.

613
00:45:21,566 --> 00:45:24,017
Not everything is politics.

614
00:45:28,569 --> 00:45:30,574
Hey, I'll take two. Western alumni.

615
00:45:30,614 --> 00:45:31,982
All right, you got it.

616
00:45:32,794 --> 00:45:33,593
Major.

617
00:45:36,272 --> 00:45:37,020
I heard.

618
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,570
How's your family take it ?

619
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:49,103
Lolita done dropped herself
30 pounds and got herself

620
00:45:49,135 --> 00:45:50,484
a real estate license

621
00:45:51,852 --> 00:45:53,674
so I guess she's fixin'to leave me.

622
00:46:02,547 --> 00:46:05,531
I just wanted you to know
that last tip you gave me

623
00:46:05,532 --> 00:46:06,876
was a winner.

624
00:46:07,361 --> 00:46:08,603
Yeah, I heard.

625
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,015
That's good work.

626
00:46:13,966 --> 00:46:16,687
Also, I don't know if you know,
Stringer Bell was shot to death

627
00:46:16,688 --> 00:46:17,770
two days ago.

628
00:46:19,696 --> 00:46:22,926
So anyway,
I put his name on the paper

629
00:46:23,101 --> 00:46:24,172
to tighten the PC.

630
00:46:26,276 --> 00:46:28,648
I figured what the fuck
once he's aced, right ?

631
00:46:32,292 --> 00:46:34,504
You always did cut
them corners, didn't you ?

632
00:46:40,162 --> 00:46:42,215
Seems like you cut a few
yourself, Major.

633
00:46:46,305 --> 00:46:48,247
However it ends,
you're good police.

634
00:46:48,589 --> 00:46:50,149
I just did what I did.

635
00:46:51,987 --> 00:46:52,932
It felt right.

636
00:46:55,767 --> 00:46:56,781
I'm fine with that.

637
00:47:40,334 --> 00:47:41,813
I don't understand.

638
00:47:45,024 --> 00:47:46,019
Drink your wine.

639
00:47:52,846 --> 00:47:53,869
You and me in public.

640
00:47:56,023 --> 00:47:58,245
- But your wife.
- She wins without me.

641
00:48:01,954 --> 00:48:05,137
On the Mayor's ticket, she wins.

642
00:48:05,198 --> 00:48:06,360
And you make major ?

643
00:48:09,326 --> 00:48:11,956
I think she was waiting for this day
more than I ever was.

644
00:48:14,175 --> 00:48:15,445
And now she's not here.

645
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:17,645
No.

646
00:48:19,389 --> 00:48:20,159
She's not.

647
00:48:28,024 --> 00:48:29,382
From out of nowhere, huh ?

648
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,758
Nowhere is right.

649
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:34,733
Why me ?

650
00:48:37,033 --> 00:48:38,517
I guess you don't live right.

651
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,495
- Kari, what was that ?
- Nothing.

652
00:48:46,527 --> 00:48:48,068
- What broke ?
- Nothing, Mama.

653
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:56,005
So...

654
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,628
Yeah.

655
00:48:58,877 --> 00:49:00,708
You just drive over here.

656
00:49:01,273 --> 00:49:01,957
I did.

657
00:49:03,533 --> 00:49:06,015
Why tonight ? What happened ?

658
00:49:09,053 --> 00:49:11,401
I was in my old district tonight

659
00:49:11,421 --> 00:49:13,834
which is where I used
to feel pretty good, I think.

660
00:49:14,755 --> 00:49:16,651
I wasn't so angry
when I was there anyway.

661
00:49:18,344 --> 00:49:20,504
I don't know, someone said
something, I guess

662
00:49:22,506 --> 00:49:23,856
and, uhit doesn't make sense.

663
00:49:27,535 --> 00:49:28,936
I guess I finished something today.

664
00:49:29,765 --> 00:49:30,469
A case ?

665
00:49:31,793 --> 00:49:32,638
More than that.

666
00:49:34,887 --> 00:49:36,654
It's like everything
I poured into a glass

667
00:49:36,758 --> 00:49:38,269
came out the bottom

668
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:41,094
and I just kept on pouring.

669
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,425
Like the thing had
a hole in it, you know.

670
00:49:45,025 --> 00:49:46,740
Things that make me right
for this job

671
00:49:46,741 --> 00:49:48,766
maybe they're the same things
that make me wrong

672
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:50,333
for everything else.

673
00:49:51,893 --> 00:49:53,787
Do you want to come inside
for a drink ?

674
00:49:58,144 --> 00:49:58,906
Not tonight.

675
00:50:02,787 --> 00:50:04,649
But if it's not too late,
I wouldn't mind

676
00:50:05,031 --> 00:50:05,881
meeting your kids.

677
00:51:05,003 --> 00:51:08,130
Major Colvin misled his officers.

678
00:51:08,176 --> 00:51:11,938
They thought that his initiative
was a tactical deployment

679
00:51:12,186 --> 00:51:14,300
to entrap narcotics traffickers.

680
00:51:14,659 --> 00:51:17,063
There was no mention whatsoever

681
00:51:17,118 --> 00:51:19,792
of the initiative to
any superior officer.

682
00:51:19,832 --> 00:51:22,687
And for five weeks, all evidence

683
00:51:22,688 --> 00:51:25,681
of what he was doing managed to elude
the entire command staff.

684
00:51:27,105 --> 00:51:28,472
Are you kidding, Commissioner ?

685
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,984
I take full responsibility

686
00:51:30,304 --> 00:51:33,153
and indeed, after I first learned
of the matter

687
00:51:33,312 --> 00:51:35,323
I informed the Mayor, and together

688
00:51:35,381 --> 00:51:36,781
we moved immediately

689
00:51:36,877 --> 00:51:39,869
to relieve Major Colvin

690
00:51:39,995 --> 00:51:41,502
I'm under the impression that

691
00:51:41,503 --> 00:51:43,725
this administration
gave serious consideration

692
00:51:43,738 --> 00:51:45,314
with Colvin's initiative.

693
00:51:45,361 --> 00:51:46,491
No, sir.

694
00:51:46,499 --> 00:51:49,093
Major Colvin informed you of his effort
at a COMSTAT meeting

695
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,430
more than a week ago.

696
00:51:50,438 --> 00:51:52,674
His free zones stayed up
for six days after that.

697
00:51:52,737 --> 00:51:55,300
That's my responsibility, Councilman.

698
00:51:55,355 --> 00:51:57,648
We needed the time to conclude
an ongoing investigation

699
00:51:57,667 --> 00:51:59,839
by the Major Crime Unit,
a wiretap case

700
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,841
that would have been disrupted

701
00:52:01,849 --> 00:52:04,952
Correct, Mayor Royce was aware
of the pending case

702
00:52:05,008 --> 00:52:08,191
and allowed us to delay
our response accordingly.

703
00:52:08,246 --> 00:52:10,475
But the Mayor was unequivocal

704
00:52:10,689 --> 00:52:13,634
in his opposition
to what Major Colvin did.

705
00:52:13,832 --> 00:52:16,494
What we have here, I'm afraid,
is nothing more complicated

706
00:52:16,495 --> 00:52:19,554
than a solitary police commander
who, under great pressure

707
00:52:19,571 --> 00:52:23,916
proved to be amoral, incompetent,
and unfit for command.

708
00:52:24,369 --> 00:52:25,054
No.

709
00:52:26,748 --> 00:52:27,847
It's about more than that.

710
00:52:27,902 --> 00:52:30,417
This is more important
than who knew what when

711
00:52:30,624 --> 00:52:32,438
or who falls on his sword

712
00:52:32,542 --> 00:52:34,706
or whether someone
can use this disaster

713
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:36,481
to make a political point or two.

714
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:37,420
Mr. Chairman...

715
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:40,340
We can forgive Major Colvin who,
out of his frustration

716
00:52:40,507 --> 00:52:42,921
and despair, found himself
condoning something which

717
00:52:42,922 --> 00:52:46,420
can't possibly be condoned.
We can do that much.

718
00:52:47,534 --> 00:52:50,414
But, gentlemen, what we can't forgive,

719
00:52:50,573 --> 00:52:53,235
what I can't forgive ever

720
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:55,451
is how we...

721
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:00,634
you, me, this administration,
all of us

722
00:53:01,857 --> 00:53:05,643
how we turned away from those streets
in West Baltimore. The poor, the sick

723
00:53:05,892 --> 00:53:09,401
the swollen underclass of our city
trapped in the wreckage of neighborhoods

724
00:53:09,433 --> 00:53:12,186
which were once so prized.
Communities which

725
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,226
we've failed to defend,
which we have surrendered

726
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,430
to the horrors of the drug trade.

727
00:53:17,573 --> 00:53:20,629
And if this disaster demands anything
of us as a city

728
00:53:20,971 --> 00:53:22,786
it demands that we say enough.

729
00:53:22,794 --> 00:53:25,770
Enough to the despair which makes
policemen even think about surrender.

730
00:53:25,778 --> 00:53:28,213
Enough to the fact that
these neighborhoods are not saved

731
00:53:28,332 --> 00:53:31,722
or are beyond the saving.
Enough to this administration's

732
00:53:31,778 --> 00:53:34,015
indecisiveness and lethargy

733
00:53:34,385 --> 00:53:36,544
to the garbage
which goes uncollected

734
00:53:36,592 --> 00:53:38,995
the lots and row houses
which stay vacant

735
00:53:39,162 --> 00:53:41,279
the addicts who go untreated

736
00:53:41,303 --> 00:53:43,050
the working men and women
who every day

737
00:53:43,051 --> 00:53:44,884
are denied a chance
at economic freedom.

738
00:53:47,712 --> 00:53:49,473
Enough to the crime,
which every day

739
00:53:49,474 --> 00:53:51,952
chokes more and more
of the life from our city.

740
00:53:53,823 --> 00:53:54,668
And...

741
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:59,062
the thing of it is, if we don't
take responsibility and step up

742
00:53:59,112 --> 00:54:01,448
not just for the mistakes
and the miscues

743
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:04,505
but for whether or not we're gonna
win this battle for our streets

744
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:05,535
if that doesn't happen

745
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:08,972
we're gonna lose these neighborhoods
and ultimately this city forever.

746
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:10,853
If we don't have the courage

747
00:54:10,877 --> 00:54:13,912
and the conviction to fight this war
they way it should be fought

748
00:54:13,913 --> 00:54:16,471
the way it needs to be fought,
using every weapon

749
00:54:16,487 --> 00:54:19,495
that we can possibly muster,
if that doesn't happen

750
00:54:21,548 --> 00:54:23,126
well, then we're staring at defeat.

751
00:54:25,924 --> 00:54:27,882
And that defeat
should not and cannot

752
00:54:27,977 --> 00:54:29,911
and will not be forgiven.

753
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,253
It was a good case

754
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:40,961
I'm not denying that

755
00:54:41,959 --> 00:54:43,582
but I need to trust my people.

756
00:54:44,577 --> 00:54:47,235
Unless you can give
your word, there's no way...

757
00:54:47,434 --> 00:54:49,518
That's more than fair.

758
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:51,540
Thanks.

759
00:54:52,009 --> 00:54:54,524
But it's better for me
if I do something else.

760
00:54:58,694 --> 00:55:00,317
Detective.

761
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,107
It's not you, it's me.

762
00:55:06,286 --> 00:55:08,694
- But where...
- The western, I think.

763
00:55:09,957 --> 00:55:12,384
Western feels like home.

764
00:55:26,737 --> 00:55:28,894
You showed something today.

765
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:31,063
Just felt like it needed to be said.

766
00:55:34,434 --> 00:55:36,387
Sounds like you're
running for something.

767
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:41,167
Eunetta.

768
00:55:42,227 --> 00:55:42,941
Been a while.

769
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,646
Thought y'all was in training.

770
00:56:15,534 --> 00:56:18,042
So what time you want us to be
there tomorrow, coach ?

771
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,608
3:30 would be good.

772
00:56:21,397 --> 00:56:23,406
- Hope to see you all then.
- A'right.

773
00:56:40,349 --> 00:56:42,266
What the fuck y'all
standing around for ?

774
00:56:43,059 --> 00:56:44,050
Man, get to work.

775
00:57:48,586 --> 00:57:50,138
That's a seed.

776
00:57:51,806 --> 00:57:52,528
Yeah.

777
01:01:12,056 --> 01:01:13,614
What do you see right here?

778
01:01:14,274 --> 01:01:16,693
It's bulk metal. 10¢ a pound.

779
01:01:17,086 --> 01:01:17,499
Here.

780
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,252
Aluminum.

781
01:01:19,399 --> 01:01:21,738
Right you are. 30¢ a pound

782
01:01:22,446 --> 01:01:24,308
no problem.

783
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:28,884
in these modern times a man
gotta keep one eye on the ground

784
01:01:29,003 --> 01:01:30,849
pick up what he find, feel me ?

785
01:01:31,573 --> 01:01:33,738
There's money to be made
if you know where to look.

786
01:01:35,464 --> 01:01:38,131
I hope you listenin','cause
I'm tryin'to school you here.

787
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,329
Yeah, you don't want to know.

788
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:43,565
You see, You think you brown,
but you still green.

789
01:01:52,133 --> 01:01:52,968
How ya doin'?

790
01:01:58,906 --> 01:01:59,962
That's somethin', huh ?

791
01:02:00,504 --> 01:02:03,416
It's like they took a big
eraserand rubbed across it.

792
01:02:04,978 --> 01:02:05,483
Yaeh !

793
01:02:08,675 --> 01:02:11,189
Yeah, but before a dope
fiend come down here

794
01:02:11,424 --> 01:02:14,982
cop a little somethin',
ain't nary a soul hassle him.

795
01:02:15,687 --> 01:02:18,494
Hoppers and police,
they just let him be.

796
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,103
Was a good thing, huh ?

797
01:02:28,312 --> 01:02:29,588
I'm just sayin'.

798
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:33,218
You probly don't know,
but it's rough out there, baby.

799
01:02:33,678 --> 01:02:37,328
Cops be back bangin'on you.
Hoppers be messin' with you.

01:02:41,655 --> 01:02:42,509
Thank you.

801
01:02:43,977 --> 01:02:44,622
Aw, shit.

802
01:02:45,221 --> 01:02:46,956
That's a dime here.
That's a seed.

803
01:02:49,467 --> 01:02:50,065
Come on, boy.
